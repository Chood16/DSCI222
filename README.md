# DSCI222

Welcome to Data Science 222: Python for Interdisciplinary Data Science and Artificial Intelligence! This course introduces key concepts, tools, and techniques used in modern data analysis and machine learning. Weâ€™ll cover Python programming, data manipulation, visualization, modeling, and communication of insights.

All content for this course can be found in our DSCI222 repository, https://github.com/Chood16/DSCI222.
Feel free to download or access online. This repo will be updated as the course progresses.

## Software
While you do have the freedom to use the software you would like for this class, below are my recommendations
* Python 3.10+
* Anaconda.Navivate
* Visual Studio Code (Install Python and Jupyter Extensions)
* Conda
* Google Colab
* Overleaf (LaTeX text editor)
* GitHub
* AI Assistants

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity
* Collaboration is encouraged for discussing concepts
* Many of our projects will be completed in groups
* All submitted work must be **your own** unless explicitly stated
* Cite sources and give credit where due
* AI is a great tool for programming and brainstorming, but may not be used during written and oral reports

## Helpful URLs
* [Download Anaconda.Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) --> Don't forget to register!
* [Create Virtual Environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8dlq-AUDpc) --> You can use the GUI, Terminal, or import DSCI222 env instead. 

    I would suggest using Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
