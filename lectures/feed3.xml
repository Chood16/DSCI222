That's because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung has already held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. </p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos that are being shown off at the event) right here. We'll be keeping this story updated throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-micro-rgb-tvs">Micro RGB TVs&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" style="height:1423px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&amp;#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV." data-uuid="0e796659-fedf-4a07-9718-5aab3d0b16da"><figcaption>Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer</a> for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.</p><p>We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>.

This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.</p><p>LG revealed its first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Micro RGB set</a> at CES as well.

The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months.

Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg">LG</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="LG&amp;#39;s CLOiD robot." data-uuid="4f24430f-4e32-4bc7-a1ad-481a02508ce9"><figcaption>LG&amp;#39;s CLOiD robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>Likewise, LG brought other non-TV tech to CES.

This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon, but we should get a closer look at the CLOiD in person this week.</p><p>The company also debuted the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">LG Sound Suite</a>, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos.

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. It all seems very neat and I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with these Smart Bricks.</p><p>The first “<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:30;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures.

It has developed four features that it’s rolling out for its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that draft an email when you say you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.</p><h2 id="jump-link-robots">Robots</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Boston-Dynamics-Atlas.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Boston-Dynamics-Atlas.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas." data-uuid="eca6e520-f063-477a-afcd-7fb18656fa63"><figcaption>The product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Boston Dynamics</div></figure><p>Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dell has unveiled an ultrawide, curved 52-inch 6K monitor at CES 2026. This productivity behemoth is designed for stock traders, engineers and other data professionals. Dell claims the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the world&#39;s first 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (but with that many qualifiers almost anything can be a world first).</p>
<p>Given Dell’s experience in the monitor realm, this could be a dream display for professionals who handle vast data sets such as trading platforms, AutoCAD, 3D rendering software, spreadsheets and more. It sports a 120Hz refresh rate on an IPS Black panel and emits up to 60 percent less blue light when compared to competing monitors. It delivers an impressive 129 ppi (for comparison a 4K 32-inch monitor delivers 138 ppi) and an ambient light sensor helps avoid eye strain during long work sessions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users can connect up to four PCs to the monitor simultaneously, which can use picture-by-picture to treat each partitioned screen as an individual monitor. It also features built-in KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) features that let users control all connected PCs via a single mouse and keyboard. The monitor can also charge your laptop with up to 140W of power via a Thunderbolt 4 connection.</p>
<p>Dell also rolled out a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with support for both True Black 500 HDR and Dolby Vision. It claims true-to-life color accuracy out of the box and excellent gamut coverage at 99 percent of DCI-P3. This monitor would be a strong fit for film and photo editing.</p>
<p>The Dell UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is priced at $2,900 with stand or $2,800 without. It will be widely available starting January 6. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor comes in at $2,600 and will be available beginning February 24.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-unveils-a-massive-52-inch-6k-ultrawide-monitor-at-ces-2026-140024029.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">NVIDIA</a> has unveiled the G-Sync Pulsar, which it calls the “latest evolution of [its] pioneering VRR (variable refresh rate) technology,” at CES 2026. The new tech promises a gaming experience that’s free of stutter with buttery smooth motion, which is made possible by pulsing the display’s backlight. G-Sync Pulsar displays have multiple horizontal backlight sections that are pulsed independently from top to bottom, unlike traditional displays whose backlight is always on. When the backlight is always active, the image fades from one frame to the next. The displays with the new tech give pixels in a frame enough time to stabilize before they’re backlit so that they’re shown in their right locations, effectively reducing monitor-based motion blur.  </p><p>The company says G-Sync Pulsar can effectively quadruple your refresh rate. If you’re playing at 250 fps, that means it can deliver a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz. That enables easier tracking and shooting in-game, making displays with the technology especially suited for esports. You can see the difference in motion in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> between a 360Hz monitor without G-Sync Pulsar and one with the technology switched on in the video below. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJlzDfCcNzw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>The first four displays designed specifically to support G-Sync Pulsar and Ambient Adaptive Technology, which allows users to automatically adjust color temperature and brightness based on ambient lighting, will be available starting on January 7. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI will each be releasing a 27-inch 2,560 × 1,440 IPS display, which comes with a 360Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of peak brightness in HDR.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-tech-can-minimize-motion-blur-for-gamers-140000058.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Razer is once again thinking big about what a gaming chair can do, and its concept for CES 2026 isn&#39;t just a chair but an entire multisensory experience to match whatever&#39;s happening on-screen. The concept, called Project Madison, combines reactive lighting, spatial audio and multi-zone haptic feedback to make the player feel more immersed in the in-game environment. We&#39;re talking Razer Chroma light strips along the head flaps, THX Spatial Audio for 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound and six haptic motor actuators powered by Razer Sensa HD Haptics to bring the physical sensations of a game to life. </p><p>One can only imagine the price tag on such a setup. Actually, I&#39;d rather not. Project Madison isn&#39;t a product you can buy right now anyway, but Razer did bring a real — albeit far less flashy — new(ish) gaming chair to CES too. The company has updated its Iskur V2 lineup with the Iskur V2 NewGen, which features the same dynamic lumbar support and dual-density cold-cured foam seat cushion that it&#39;s known for, but now wrapped in Razer&#39;s Gen-2 EPU Leather with CoolTouch Technology for a long-lasting cooling effect.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Iskur_V2_NewGen.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Iskur_V2_NewGen.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Four Razer gaming chairs &#x002014; in light gray, black with green trim, black, and light pink &#x002014; are pictured beside each other spot-lit in a dark room" data-uuid="590b87fe-97e7-4cda-b531-5620edf5e1bd"/><figcaption>Razer&#39;s Iskur V2 NewGen chair in Light Gray, Black/Green, Black and Quartz.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Per Razer, &quot;The chair’s material delivers high thermal effusivity, keeping it cool to the touch for hours of play.&quot; That CoolTouch faux leather is also coming to the less expensive Iskur V2 X, with the Iskur V2 X NewGen. Pre-orders for both chairs are now open, though the company hasn&#39;t yet said when they&#39;ll ship. The $650 Razer Iskur V2 NewGen comes in Black/Green, Black, Quartz and Light Gray, while the $350 Iskur V2 X NewGen is available in Black/Green, Black and Quartz.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-madison-concept-chair-has-reactive-lighting-immersive-audio-and-multi-zone-haptics-140000118.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We see plenty of far-out ideas on the CES show floor, and this year Razer brought in a concept piece called Project Motoko. The device is Razer&#39;s take on blurring the line between a gaming headset and an AI-powered wearable for daily life. Or it&#39;s a way for <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> fans to feel affronted by Razer taking The Major&#39;s name in vain, take your pick.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Motoko is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon platforms. The headset has a pair of first-person view cameras positioned at eye level that can support real-time object and text recognition. It also has a wide field of attention that can capture things happening beyond the normal human eye&#39;s peripheral vision, and its microphone array is designed to capture both near and distant audio.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Project Motoko is more than a concept, it’s a vision for the future of AI and wearable computing,&quot; Nick Bourne, Razer&#39;s global head of mobile console division, said in the press release about the device. &quot;By partnering with Qualcomm Technologies, we’re building a platform that enhances gameplay while transforming how technology integrates into everyday life. This is the next frontier for immersive experiences.&quot;</p><p>In addition to taking in environmental details, Project Motoko can also operate as a wearable AI assistant, and the model is compatible with several different chatbots. The company&#39;s press release noted that it can integrate with Grok, OpenAI and Gemini. Since Project Motoko is a concept device, Razer has no plans for a commercial release of this headset, but one of the highlights of CES is seeing these more experimental designs. Razer is also well-established as a brand for serious gamers, so seeing the company explore making an AI wearable that could appeal to a broader audience, if still a geeky one, is an intriguing move.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-motoko-is-a-concept-gaming-headset-that-doubles-as-an-ai-wearable-140000534.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ring turned up to CES with a whole host of announcements, including a revamped range of home sensors. Ring Sensors (for that is their name) is a new lineup of tools, built on Amazon’s Sidewalk low-power networking protocol. That includes updated versions of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-02-ring-protect-home-security-system.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFosSCo6ISp0KdhLHnu1rNGge0S1foVXhWpFAN9QN4wYvcCb9N2r-T7utBC6IVnPwKeCMlweVnHE9bHN69mRUqeL2UCT9JYcJqXeyv6yLdukUq_PaE72_B3MrXsF4nBKOhgndxkvNst1h9slQJkn_KJAeHVfKrjBTEJLXcmExr1v" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">door, window</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-glass-break-sensor-home-alarm-160001208.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">break glass sensors</a>, as well as a new OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. You’ll be able to pre-order the new car alarm today, while the rest of the new sensors will be available at some point in March. And, in tandem with that news, Amazon is announcing that Sidewalk is expanding outside of the US, starting in Canada and Mexico.</p><p>At the same time, the company is launching a number of enhancements to its app platform, including the Ring Appstore. This will let users purchase and integrate with third-party apps which have been built to cater to “specific use cases, from small business operations to everyday needs around the home.” The company added that, in the coming weeks, users will be able to browse a growing number of apps designed to help “you get more value from your Ring cameras.”</p><p>The company is also throwing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-uses-generative-ai-to-cut-down-on-unnecessary-alerts-150033561.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">more AI into its system</a> to better coordinate its alerts, including Unusual Event Alerts. These will learn from the patterns around your home and, when it spots something out of the ordinary, send you a ping. Active Warnings, meanwhile, will use computer vision to identify potential threats and offer “specific warnings based on details like location and actions.”</p><p>Finally, Ring has teamed up with Watch Duty, a non-profit alert platform designed to share useful information about local wildfires. The pair have added a Fire Watch feature to the Neighbors app to enable communities keep each other in the loop about local fire and smoke events. Ring users are encouraged to share details from their own Ring cameras to “support first responders on the ground.”</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-relaunches-its-suite-of-smart-home-sensors-140000667.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Paris court has found 10 people guilty of cyberbullying Brigitte Macron, wife of President of France Emmanuel Macron, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78v6z7597yo" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the <em>BBC</em> reports</a>. The judge found that the defendants made false claims about Macron's gender and sexuality, and "malicious remarks" about the 24-year age gap between Macron and her spouse.</p><p>Of the ten defendants, only one received a firm prison sentence of six months, according to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="c-link link" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2026/01/05/les-cyberharceleurs-de-brigitte-macron-condamnes-jusqu-a-6-mois-de-prison-ferme_6660611_3224.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>LeMonde</em></a>. Eight others received suspended sentences (effectively probation in France) of four to eight months, while the 10th person received a fine and was required to attend a sensitivity training course. Three of the “instigators” found guilty will lose access to their social media accounts for six months.</p><p>Key to the lawsuit is the fringe belief that Brigitte Macron was born a man — proponents for some reason believe Macron is Jean-Michel Trogneux, her older brother — and transitioned to living as a woman at some point later in life. This style of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://glaad.org/transvestigation-definition-meaning-anti-lgbt-online-hate/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">"transvestigation"</a> is an unfortunately common type of online conspiracy theory, a roundabout way to both spread hateful rhetoric about transgender people and bully cisgender people at the same time. The campaign against Macron has the added twist of her age: Brigitte Macron is 72, 24 years older than President Macron. The pair married in 2007, but their age difference has been an ongoing narrative throughout Emmanuel Macron's political career.</p><p>In July 2025, Macron also filed <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9f9f3597-08dc-42a1-8337-e67318bbf482&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=a+defamation+lawsuit+in+the+US+against+Candace+Owens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA3LzIzL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9tYWNyb24tbGF3c3VpdC1jYW5kYWNlLW93ZW5zLWRlZmFtYXRpb24uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWY5ZjM1OTctMDhkYy00MmExLTgzMzctZTY3MzE4YmJmNDgyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA3LzIzL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9tYWNyb24tbGF3c3VpdC1jYW5kYWNlLW93ZW5zLWRlZmFtYXRpb24uaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVDLcX-PqDG4_l1VrG3yQOGKoF7LmqUBGdNekhDcNQ1E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F07%2F23%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fmacron-lawsuit-candace-owens-defamation.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/world/europe/macron-lawsuit-candace-owens-defamation.html">a defamation lawsuit in the US against Candace Owens</a>, a right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist.

<p>Navimow&#39;s lineup includes the flagship X4 Series for large yards up to 1.5 acres in size. Its AWD system can handle slopes up to 40 degrees and it sports dual 180-watt cutting motors. The largest mode, the X450 will retail for $3,000. A smaller X430 rated for yards up to 1 acre will go for $2,500.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Navimow i2 series comes in AWD and LiDAR variants and is designed for &quot;everyday&quot; lawn maintenance. The AWD variant&#39;s three-wheel-drive system can handle 24-degree slopes and is designed to handle muddy or slippery terrain. The larger i2 AWD model, called the i210 AWD is rated for yards up to a quarter-acre in size, and will retail for $1,300. A smaller model dubbed the i206 AWD can handle yards as large as 0.15 acres and will go for $1,000.</p>
<p>The i2 LiDAR variant can scan 200,000 points per second to create a detailed spatial map of your yard, allowing it to navigate complex paths and, crucially, work at night. That model is rated for yards up to 0.37 acres in size. Pricing has not been announced for the i215 LiDAR model.</p>
<p>Finally, the H2 series features three vision technologies integrated into one model, with LiDAR, Network RTK and cameras combining into what Navimow is calling LiDAR+. The H2 is built for slopes up to 24 degrees and can handle yards up to half an acre in size. The H2 is being released in two models. The H210 for yards up to 0.25 acres, and the H220 for half-acre yards. Pricing for the H2 series has not been released yet.</p>
<p>The i2 AWD Series and the X4 Series will be available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c1b8854e-85cc-4e08-aee8-992000b9a41f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=pre-order&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25hdmltb3cuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3ByZS1vcmRlci1zYWxlcz91dG1fc291cmNlPXByLWVhcm5lZCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXByJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj0yMDI2X3VzX2NlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFiODg1NGUtODVjYy00ZTA4LWFlZTgtOTkyMDAwYjlhNDFmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25hdmltb3cuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3ByZS1vcmRlci1zYWxlcz91dG1fc291cmNlPXByLWVhcm5lZCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXByJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj0yMDI2X3VzX2NlcyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYws0Q7p32jz7pBt-clES_K8fCq_zsUnPjC0hutR_fRM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnavimow.com%2Fpages%2Fpre-order-sales%3Futm_source%3Dpr-earned%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D2026_us_ces" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://navimow.com/pages/pre-order-sales?utm_source=pr-earned&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=2026_us_ces"><ins>pre-order</ins></a> beginning January 16.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/segways-navimow-brand-unveiled-a-new-line-of-robotic-lawn-mowers-at-ces-2026-130007014.html?src=rss]]></description>

Who knows). Naturally, the company has turned up to CES 2026 with the former, but it’s also branching out into home security. It’s announcing SynCare, an AI infused all-in-one surveillance platform which, it rather boldly claims, will become an “attentive, integrated guardian” of your home.</p><p>Leading the pack is the SynCare Video Doorbell with head-to-toe 4K video, intelligent detection and 24/7 recording — especially if you’ve got it hooked up to your Ugreen NAS. That works in tandem with SynCare cameras offering 4K video on a pan-tilt base and, of course, AI to recognise “people, pets and key events.” Ugreen is also offering a tablet, the SynCare Smart Display, a “home hub” to let you manage your cameras from a single place in your home.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is quick to highlight the major benefit of an at-home system like this, which is no need to pay for a monthly subscription. And, of course, that the footage from your home stays inside your home at all times, making it a better option for those folks who value their privacy. Sadly, Ugreen isn’t ready to share pricing or availability information for the series, saying it’ll be available in the back end of 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ugreen-launches-a-smart-home-security-platform-at-ces-130000389.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m no psychologist, but I get a sense Segway turned up to CES 2026 with something to prove after last year. Certainly, it’s gone out of its way to prove its micromobility bona fides with the press, who perhaps were a bit too sniffy that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-is-finally-launching-e-bikes-at-ces-2025-130015667.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">scooter people were launching an e-bike.</a> This year, Segway’s not just launching two more mainstream e-bikes, but an electric dirt bike, all of which are crammed with the sort of tech that might just make everyone halt their sniffiness.</p><p>First up, there’s the Myon, a chunky step-through with a decent-sized pannier rack for folks who want to go far and carry a bit of luggage as they go. That’s hardly an eye-catching proposition given so many e-bikes fit within the same template, but Segway is hoping its tech will make a difference here. Myon is equipped with electronic gear shifting (tied to a Shimano CUES chain drivetrain), electronic motor optimization and the company’s proprietary Intelligent Ride System.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter, along with Segway(TM) TurboTuned(TM) will automatically optimize motor and battery performance while under way. The company adds that the bike’s built-in gyros, cadence and torque sensors will meter out performance according to road conditions. So if you’re going up hill, the power will gently increase before you have to think about it. Additionally, if you stop at the lights, the system won’t just turn on the power to whatever you’ve set it at as soon as it senses the tiniest ounce of pressure on the pedal, removing the jerky start action you see in other bikes.</p><p>Segway’s broader pitch is that its bikes will also feature a whole host of smart features, including integration with Apple’s Find My network, GPS tracking, remote locking, integration with your health and fitness app of choice, and smartphone pairing.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg" style="height:5464px;width:8192px;" alt="Muxi" data-uuid="86d61664-366b-44f6-87b7-62c3c0830829"/><figcaption>Muxi</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Segway</div></figure><p>Muxi (pronounced <em>moo-shee</em>) is a more interesting piece of hardware, since it’s been built like a longtail cargo bike, but with the long tail chopped off. Even so, the focus is on cargo, with the bike getting an optional passenger seat with foot pegs, and an optional middle basket. Plus, the bike comes with a beverage cup holder (although given it has a direct drive motor, I’m not sure I’d want to cruise around at low speed while trying to sip my morning latte). To ensure you don’t struggle with your load, the bike comes with Hill Start Assist, Hill Descent Control, regenerative braking and traction control. Plus the aforementioned suite of added value features, like Find My integration, remote locking, GPS and the app integrations.&nbsp;</p><p>Rounding out the announcements is the Xaber (<em>say-br</em>) 300, an electric dirt bike geared toward off-roading. It has three power modes, letting you learn on the equivalent of a 150cc engine, then dialing that up to 200cc, before topping out at 300cc. If you still want a greater sense of control, you can activate an electronic clutch, and if you want to cede more of it to the bike, you can set the maximum wheelie angle. There’s no price for Xaber, but the company says expect to learn more about it when it makes it debut in Spring or Summer this year.</p><p>As for Myon, it’s available to buy today from Segway’s official site and via its dealer network, priced at $2,000. Muxi will be available through those same channels in March, setting you back $1,700.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html?src=rss]]></description>

Perhaps because the idea of birds nibbling on seeds and flying away represents a natural purity and freedom that doesn’t exist within the halls of CES. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://mybirdbuddy.com/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Birdbuddy</a> was one of the first smart bird feeder brands, with a wildly successful Kickstarter back in 2020. And this year, they’ve added birdsong to their species identification capabilities. </p><p>Two new feeders, the Birdbuddy 2 and the Birdbuddy 2 Mini both have the new feature, but the latter is a more affordable, starter version. The Bird Buddy 2 is solar-powered with built-in panels. It’s slightly larger and has a bigger seed capacity, too. Both have HD cameras you can manually position either vertically or horizontally and both have a mic to help with birdsong IDs. </p><p>Upgrades to the cameras include a faster wake-up time when a bird lands and the housing for the seed and camera has a more modular design that makes the feeder easier to clean. The lens is now protected by Gorilla Glass, which may seem excessive, but Rhian Humphries, Birdbuddy’s senior PR manager, said curious birds often peck at the camera looking for more food. </p><p>The AI Birdbuddy uses was trained on real bird visits and at the end of each day, you’ll get a “postcard,” a curated look at the birds that visited your feeder that day. Of course, the app can also alert you each time you have a feathered customer in your yard so you can tune into nature’s live feed and soothe your soul for a few. </p><p>The  Birdbuddy 2 goes for $199. It sold out during the pre-order phase, and those units will ship in February, but more will be available in mid 2026. The Birdbuddy 2 Mini costs $129 with pre-orders opening in summer. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/birdbuddys-new-smart-bird-feeder-can-id-birds-by-their-songs-122000692.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is pausing release of its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Ray-Ban Display smart glasses</a> to the UK, France, Italy and Canada due to &quot;unprecedented demand and limited inventory,&quot; the company said on Monday at CES 2026. There&#39;s no new date for the expansion that was originally set for early 2026. &quot;We&#39;ll continue to focus on fulfilling orders in the US while we re-evaluate our approach to international availability,&quot; Meta wrote on its blog.</p>
<p>Since Meta&#39;s display glasses first went on sale, acquiring them has been a challenge. They&#39;re not available online and can only be found in a limited number of retail outlets including select Ray-Ban, Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters and Best Buy locations in the United States. To buy them, you need to book an appointment for a demo at one those stores via Meta&#39;s website. Ahead of launch, Meta said it saw &quot;strong&quot; demand for demos with locations booked ahead for several weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There was optimism that availability would increase as the company expected buying options to &quot;expand&quot; the longer they were on sale. However, with the delay of the planned international launch, it appears that the company still has a mismatch between supply and demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta&#39;s $799 Ray-Ban Display glasses are its first to incorporate a heads-up display and are also equipped with a camera, stereo speakers, six microphones, WiFi 6 and a finger tracking Neural Band controller. In her review, Engadget&#39;s senior reporter Karissa Bell noted that the Ray-Ban display &quot;enables wearers to do much more than what&#39;s currently possible with [other] Ray-Ban or Oakley models&quot; — provided you don&#39;t mind the look of the chunky, chunky frames.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-delayed-the-international-rollout-of-its-display-glasses-120056833.html?src=rss]]></description>

In 2025, the company commercialized it for the first time in its Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which users control via a dedicated neural band that is able to interpret subtle muscle movements in the wrist.</p><p>Now, at CES 2026, the company is offering its first look at how its neural band could be used to control devices outside of its smart glasses lineup. Meta has teamed up with Garmin, as well as a handful of research partners, to explore some intriguing use cases for its wrist-based controller.</p><p>The social media company has previously worked with Garmin on f<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">itness integrations</a> for its glasses. But at CES, the companies were showing off a very early demo of how Meta&#39;s neural band inside of a car to control the built-in infotainment system.&nbsp;</p><p>The experience is part of Garmin&#39;s &quot;Unified Cabin&quot; concept, which explores a bunch of AI-centric in-car experiences. The demo I tried was fairly limited: while wearing a neural band, I was able to navigate two apps on a touchscreen display in Garmin&#39;s cockpit setup. In one, I used pinch and swipe gestures to manipulate an onscreen model of a car, much like how I would use the band to zoom in and out of an image while wearing the display glasses. The second demo, somewhat bizarrely, was a game of 2048.

<p></p> 
<p>No pun intended, but what I like about <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Quicken;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Quicken&amp;linkText=Quicken+Simplifi&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAay1xJNTnjYldw5nF1qz8tSfhiJSkTuaz3OiZWyrTB-K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fquicken.com%2Flp%2Fppc%2Fsimplifi-vs-mint%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://quicken.com/lp/ppc/simplifi-vs-mint/">Quicken Simplifi</a> is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Another one of the key features I appreciate is the ability to set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch).</p> 
<p>Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there&#39;s a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.</p>

<p>In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase.</p> 
<p>The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average.</p> 
<p>Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.”</p>

My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it&#39;s more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it.</p> 
<p>Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You&#39;ll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.</p>

<p>Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=introduced&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9yZXBvcnRzLWNhbmFkYS1pbXByb3ZlZC1zeW5jaW5nIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3JlcG9ydHMtY2FuYWRhLWltcHJvdmVkLXN5bmNpbmcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeK62o1SLpdRxDJdlcN8USUe_xrXlKuyGd4uvsYmoaYy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Freports-canada-improved-syncing" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/reports-canada-improved-syncing">introduced</a> a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph.</p> 
<p>The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+expanded+on+the+net+worth+graph&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9uZXctbmV0LXdvcnRoLWNoYXJ0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWFuZC1tb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L25ldy1uZXQtd29ydGgtY2hhcnQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtYW5kLW1vcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVv90h2WMw7_4yXuvFvGDLlzhRQRUn1jj223BWdeKJX5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fnew-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/new-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more">Monarch expanded on the net worth graph</a>, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time.</p> 
<p>On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.mx.com/">MX</a> and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://help.simplifimoney.com/en/articles/8545901-how-to-import-transactions-from-mint">has a Chrome extension</a> for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data.</p> 
<p>Additionally, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9zeW5jLXlvdXItYXBwbGUtY2FyZC1hcHBsZS1jYXNoLWFuZC1zYXZpbmdzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3N5bmMteW91ci1hcHBsZS1jYXJkLWFwcGxlLWNhc2gtYW5kLXNhdmluZ3MifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX0braGlEY1h2EHzEVeCqtzANy-Xa-2RelG8k1e75rFW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fsync-your-apple-card-apple-cash-and-savings" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/sync-your-apple-card-apple-cash-and-savings">Monarch</a> just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It&#39;s not the only one either; currently, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/copilotmoney/status/1765099126595764288">Copilot</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:YNAB;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b2df7bfa-ff43-44ef-a78c-6e045229e2f8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YNAB&amp;linkText=YNAB&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55bmFiLmNvbS9ibG9nL3luYWItYXBwbGUtd2FsbGV0PyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55bmFiLmNvbS9ibG9nL3luYWItYXBwbGUtd2FsbGV0PyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb0hLCO0fajT5k7FD62mlqPyFHmvI2Sjsi-tsuMQzQ2N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ynab.com%2Fblog%2Fynab-apple-wallet%3F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.ynab.com/blog/ynab-apple-wallet?">YNAB</a> have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch&#39;s to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month.</p> 
<p>Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn&#39;t provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://copilot.money/">Copilot Money</a> might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there.</p>

<p>There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses.</p> 
<p>Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing.</p>

<p>Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="mailto:venmo@venmo.com">venmo@venmo.com</a> are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app.</p> 
<p>While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits.</p> 
<p>Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well.</p> 
<p>Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://intelligence.copilot.money/">its website</a>, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year.</p> 
<p>Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark.</p>

 <core-commerce id="39236874c65c492bb3682eddbfa1c0a2" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.nerdwallet.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You may know <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a> as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too.</p> 
<p>Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA).</p>

<p>As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you&#39;ll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though.</p> 
<p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says.</p> 
<p>Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring.</p> 
<p>Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay).</p>

A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you.</p> 
<p>Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting.</p> 
<p>The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week).</p> 
<p>My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-how-ynab-gives-me-peace-of-mind-and-keeps-my-money-in-check-140049410.html">penned a respectful rebuttal</a>, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-mint-alternatives-we-tested">Other Mint alternatives we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> 
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p>

<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-import-your-financial-data-from-the-mint-app">How to import your financial data from the Mint app</h2> 
<p>Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data.</p> 
<p>To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><p>Sign into Mint.com and hit <strong>Transactions</strong> in the menu on the left side of the screen.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Select an account, or <strong>all accounts</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Scroll down and look for “<strong>export [number] transactions</strong>” in smaller print.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Your CSV file should begin downloading.</p></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-mint-alternatives">How we tested Mint alternatives</h2> 
<p>Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a> myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p>

If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we&#39;ll consider it in future updates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Noted turntable manufacturer Victrola just announced the Soundstage speaker at CES. This thin little doodad actually sits underneath turntables, removing the need for a full stereo set-up. The Soundstage isn&#39;t the first speaker that offers this functionality, but this one has tech-forward features.</p>
<p>It offers multiple connection options, including Bluetooth. Many newer Victrola turntables can do Bluetooth streaming, so adding this speaker to a setup would be extremely simple. Otherwise, companies offer Bluetooth receivers for turntables.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also allows for traditional wired connections, and there&#39;s an option for USB-C. In other words, the Soundstage should easily connect to other audio sources like smartphones and computers. It even integrates with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluetooth-auracast-is-everywhere-at-ces-2024-so-what-is-it-224509414.html">Auracast for multi-speaker setups</a>.</p>

<p>As for sound, Victrola promises superior audio thanks to a &quot;vibration-isolated design.&quot; There&#39;s a specialized woofer for bass response and balanced mode radiators (a type of driver) for stereo separation. It likely won&#39;t sound as good as a full sound system but, again, think of all of those annoying wires.</p>
<p>The Soundstage will be available this summer and costs $350. There will be multiple colorways, including walnut and black.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/this-speaker-by-victrola-sits-underneath-turntables-and-streams-audio-via-bluetooth-100021991.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cambridge Audio has three new active speakers at CES 2026. The L/R Series is a trio of active bookshelf-style speakers, each with wired and wireless modes.</p><p>The flagship L/R X is an 800W model (400W per speaker). The largest of the three, it unsurprisingly carries the highest price, at $2,299. It uses a 2.5-way acoustic design: a 28mm Torus tweeter alongside dual 5-inch woofers. The L/R X has a pair of 6-inch force-canceling passive radiators, a 64-bit audio pipeline, DynamEQ and Wi-Fi streaming (via Cambridge Audio&#39;s StreamMagic app). It even adds LED underlighting for an extra aesthetic touch.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cambridge_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cambridge_2.jpg" style="height:4838px;width:8064px;" alt="The walnut variant of Cambridge Audio&#39;s new L/R X speaker" data-uuid="390b526a-c4c9-41c4-aa1c-b3667bf1319a"><figcaption>The walnut variant of the L/R X</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cambridge Audio</div></figure><p>In the middle is the $1,599 L/R M. Cambridge Audio describes it as using the same foundations as the flagship model (including the 2.5-way acoustic design), but with only 300W of power. This model has smaller (4-inch) dual woofers alongside the same 28mm tweeter. Its smaller force-canceling passive radiators measure 4.75 inches each. Like the larger model, the L/R M supports Wi-Fi streaming and includes LED underlighting.</p><p>The smallest and most affordable of the three is the $549 L/R S. This 100W speaker pairs a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer. Although you can save money on this model, you&#39;ll miss out on Wi-Fi streaming. (In its place is Bluetooth aptX HD.) It also lacks the LED underlighting found in the L/R X and L/R M.</p><p>Each speaker is available in black, white, green, blue, orange and walnut colors. Cambridge Audio says all three tiers of L/R speakers will be available &quot;later in 2026.&quot; You can learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=90f83fc3-1e13-45b9-adbb-33393a2a4c6a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5e76e609-818b-4aa4-9abc-c2c548375b5c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Cambridge+Audio&amp;linkText=the+company%E2%80%99s+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYW1icmlkZ2VhdWRpby5jb20vdXNhL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2hpLWZpL3NwZWFrZXJzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZTc2ZTYwOS04MThiLTRhYTQtOWFiYy1jMmM1NDgzNzViNWMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWF1ZGlvLmNvbS91c2EvZW4vcHJvZHVjdHMvaGktZmkvc3BlYWtlcnMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARvaURv2aiXkpVjg5VzPBIGU2Jfwb0TYbFPNUBMbgXsy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridgeaudio.com%2Fusa%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fhi-fi%2Fspeakers" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Cambridge Audio;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cambridgeaudio.com/usa/en/products/hi-fi/speakers">the company’s website</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/cambridge-audio-unveils-three-wireless-bookshelf-speakers-at-ces-100000178.html?src=rss]]></description>

At CES 2026, the company is debuting its most recent model, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c7276387-942e-43c9-bbe7-15cc23735bfb&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+OpenFit+Pro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob2t6LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9vcGVuZml0LXBybyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzcyNzYzODctOTQyZS00M2M5LWJiZTctMTVjYzIzNzM1YmZiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob2t6LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9vcGVuZml0LXBybyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeg1en6vG2ashQD2vN0kcHiCs9GsF5tXTkou1q1nfU7n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshokz.com%2Fproducts%2Fopenfit-pro" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://shokz.com/products/openfit-pro">the OpenFit Pro</a>, which combines effective noise reduction with Dolby Atmos support in a premium set of wireless buds. As the name suggests, these sit outside of your ears, secured by an over-the-ear hook, so that you can stay in tune with your surroundings at all times. </p>
<p>To me, the main appeal of the OpenFit Pro is the new Noise Reduction Mode that acts as a bit of active noise cancellation (ANC) for the open earbuds. The feature is adjustable, allowing you to slide between Reduced, Default and Enhanced levels of said reduction. I’m happy to report the tool does make a difference, even at its lowest setting, by assisting with background noise like raucous HVAC units. Shokz says the OpenFit Pro’s noise reduction is best suited for moderately noisy environments — like cafes, gyms and offices. And when you don’t need it, you can switch back to Open Mode for a fully unfiltered line to reality. </p>

<p>The other attractive feature on the OpenFit Pro is Dolby Atmos spatial sound and Dolby Audio with Dolby head tracking. Streaming music in Atmos really shows what the OpenFit Pro is capable of, putting the “ultra large” 11mm x 20mm synchronized dual-diaphragm drivers at the forefront. Shokz promises more powerful bass and “more authentic” sound in this model, and I’d say the company delivers on that promise based on my initial testing. The only issue is that your neighbors will be able to hear your tunes at moderate volumes. My colleagues sitting across the table as I write this commented on my selection of “The Fate of Ophelia.” Call me Tay-curious. </p>
<p>You can expect up to six hours on a charge and up to 24 hours of use with the case with Noise Reduction Mode enabled. Turn that feature off and you’ll get up to 12 hours on the earbuds themselves. Plus, there’s IP55 protection, wireless charging and wear detection, so the OpenFit Pro will be both durable and convenient to use. </p>
<p>The OpenFit Pro is available for preorder starting today (January 6) for $249.95.

The new DLSS 4.5 promises sharper visuals with the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which the company says will deliver better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing. The DLSS 4.5 also includes Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, which maximizes frame per second to monitor refresh rate, delivering up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance.</p><p>The 2nd Gen Transformer Super Resolution is available now for all RTX GPUs, while the Dynamic 6x Frame Generation will arrive some time in spring 2026 for the RTX 50 series. It will also be available for more than 400 games through the NVIDIA app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature is RTX Remix Logic, which allows real-time environmental reactions to in-game events. For instance, when a door is opened on screen, the NVIDIA tech can present changes to volumetric conditions, display different weather simulations with particles or alter materials. More than 30 different common events can be detected, and the RTX Remix Logic can make adaptations to volumetrics, particles, material properties and light properties.</p><p>NVIDIA noted that it now has native clients for both Linux and Fire TV.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For better or worse, CES 2026 is already shaping up to be a big year for humanoid robots. Chinese company Agibot showed up with two: the roughly human-sized <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.agibot.com/products/A2_D">A2</a> and the slightly smaller <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.agibot.com/products/X2">X2</a>, both of which were displaying their surprisingly impressive dancing abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We watched both robots walk around, wave at passersby and show off their best moves. The larger A2 mostly kept its legs still and danced mainly with its arms. The smaller X2 on the other hand is a bit more nimble — it has a larger set of &quot;feet&quot; to give it more stability — and those abilities were on full display.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the time we saw them, the robots were controlled partially by an Agibot rep using a dedicated controller, but the company told me the robots are able to move autonomously in spaces once they&#39;ve been able to use their onboard sensors to map out their  environmentThe company, which has already shipped several thousand robots in China and plans to make them available in the United States this year, says both the A2 and X2 are intended to provide a flexible platform so people can interact with the robots in a variety of situations.</p>
<div id="783a476bfff8442ba791e271141fd7cd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year seems to be the year that the robots have learned to do laundry, dance and probably a bunch of other stuff. These humanoid 🤖 are made by Agibot and they have the dance moves down <a href="https://t.co/MnT11Xq4Yq">pic.twitter.com/MnT11Xq4Yq</a></p>— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) <a href="https://twitter.com/karissabe/status/2008392964180242887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>Agibot envisions the larger A2 as a kind of hospitality helper robot that can greet visitors at museums or conferences (like CES) and provide directions or even walk alongside their human guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smaller X2 on the other hand could be suited for educational purposes or other scenarios when you might want a robot with slightly more human-like movements. It could even be a good TikTok companion, as Agibot&#39;s head of communications, Yuheng Feng explained to me. &quot;Take a Tiktok video, for example, you can use that video to train the robot, [so] it can also dance exactly like you did in the video.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company hasn&#39;t given details on when its robots might show up in the US or how much they might cost. Feng told me a lot will depend on how companies want to use them because their hardware is able to be customized depending on the use case. For now, though, we&#39;ll just soak in the dance moves.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/agibots-humanoid-robots-can-give-directions-and-learn-your-tiktok-dances-045049798.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>The following article discusses adult themes.</em></strong></p><p>One surprising find at CES 2026 comes from OhDoki, the Norwegian makers of The Handy, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-13-finally-a-good-digital-masturbator.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">smart stroking</a> device. It turned up to the desert with two new products, the Handy 2 and the Handy 2 Pro. Fundamentally, they’re the same device, but the Handy 2 Pro comes with a far bigger battery, taking the usable life from one hour on the standard model all the way to five. That extra power enables you to run the 2 Pro far faster and harder than the original once you set it into Turbo mode. In fact, I was told the hardware can essentially be “overclocked,” although I wouldn’t recommend it. Because the motor action was so aggressive that even just holding it in the hand, I’d be worried about breaking bones.</p><p>There are plenty of useful new features, including using the Handy’s beefy battery to charge your other USB-C devices. In addition, the sleeves are now be mounted to the motor arm with a click on motion, so you don’t have to wrestle with the (very) weighty hardware when you don’t have to. There are even tripod screws on both the side and bottom of the unit, enabling you to mount the Handy 2 to any compatible equipment. And, if you don’t want to use your phone to control the action, there’s a dot matrix display on the side which will show you both speed and stroke length.</p><p>Naturally, the company’s representatives were keen to highlight the connectivity features beyond just connecting to your own phone. As well as allowing other people to control the device, it’ll sync with various VR and video content platforms as well as tube sites like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-12-porn-site-bans-all-north-carolina-users-anti-lgbt-law.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xhamster.</a> And the company has recently teamed up with a cam platform for more remote opportunities for intimacy.</p><p>The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro launch January 6, with the regular model priced at $299 and the Pro going for $499.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-handy-2-pro-is-an-overclockable-sex-toy-044456140.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year in Las Vegas at CES 2025, Sony Honda Mobility displayed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">yet another revision</a> of its now-familiar yet still-unreleased Afeela 1 sedan. With a starting price of $89,900 and a maximum range of 300 miles, it didn&#39;t seem like a great value proposition. 12 months later, the math still hasn&#39;t changed, but would-be buyers now have a slightly taller option to consider.</p><p>Meet the Afeela Prototype 2026, a version of the Afeela 1 sedan that&#39;s been up-scaled to better suit American SUV proclivities. It offers a carbon copy of the smaller Afeela&#39;s understated styling, including the external, nose-mounted LCD, and is due &quot;as early as 2028.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_010.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_010.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Afeela Prototype 2026" data-uuid="37add2f9-f937-4d3b-8ea0-b5e31beedd33"/><figcaption>Afeela Prototype 2026</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>That&#39;s code for &quot;2029 is probably more likely&quot; and is, sadly, all we know about the thing for now.&nbsp;</p><p>And what about the Afeela 1? Shugo Yamaguchi, president and CEO of Sony Honda Mobility of America, confirmed that it&#39;s still on track for a release this year, still priced at $90,000 to start, and still set to be built at Honda&#39;s Ohio factory. That last bit is particularly good news, as the global tariff situation has been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/trump-to-impose-25-percent-tariffs-on-all-cars-not-made-in-the-us-120026997.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">rather</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/trump-temporarily-eases-car-tariffs-following-automaker-complaints-130011086.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">fluid</a> since we saw the sedan last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the rest of the Afeela 1&#39;s core attributes haven&#39;t aged so well, particularly given it&#39;s intended to appeal to an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">increasingly skeptical American market</a>, a situation that has driven Honda to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-its-us-plans-are-getting-more-tepid-150000775.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">dial down</a> its own US EV aspirations. 300 miles of range is an increasingly middling figure, especially for a machine priced within spitting distance of a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-new-taycan-evs-have-more-range-faster-acceleration-and-a-higher-price-123514002.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Porsche Taycan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the Afeela 1 compelling, Sony Honda Mobility is leaning into the tech play, launching with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system (a la <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gms-super-cruise-expansion-adds-750000-miles-of-rural-roads-100119273.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">GM&#39;s Super Cruise</a>). Thanks to the beauty of over-the-air updates, the Afeela 1 will eventually offer Level 4 autonomy, leaning on a bevy of integrated sensors, including a roof-mounted LIDAR pod. That would theoretically mean you could drive in <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> while your car drove you to work.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_004.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_004.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Afeela 1" data-uuid="4cc8694b-bfeb-4c2e-9252-49cf2f856383"/><figcaption>Afeela 1</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>At launch, though, the driver will only be able to play GT and other PlayStation games while the car is parked, thanks to built-in Remote Play functionality. Beyond gaming, Sony is building out a comprehensive set of APIs that will enable third-party developers to create immersive in-cabin experiences, including custom gauge clusters and infotainment skins. All that will be run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon Digital Chassis, with enough power to handle both the evolving active safety and infotainment duties.</p><p>That all sounds fun, but the bad news is that would-be buyers are going to have to wait a little longer to start customising their rides. Production on the Afeela 1 has slipped, and it will not ship to the first customers until the very end of 2026. Those customers will have to be in California, as that&#39;s the only state where the sedan will be for sale. Arizona will come next, sometime in 2027, but nobody at Sony Honda Mobility will say which state will get the next bite of this apple, or when.&nbsp;</p><p>Will it be worth the wait? We&#39;ll circle back later with more detailed impressions from inside this year&#39;s iteration of the Afeela 1.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html?src=rss]]></description>

It combines AI image recognition with a rich food database, so you can monitor your calorie and nutrient intake without leaving the app — and even log some food through its watches.</p>
<p>The food tracking works similarly to existing apps like MyFitnessPal, Noom, LifeSum and many others. Still, Garmin hopes to make its companion app the best place for tracking nutrition without having to leave its app – and tying it into your other fitness goals.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This makes sense in a few ways. If you already use Garmin to track your exercise, the app can provide a more accurate estimate of your calorie expenditure. It’ll personalize it based on height, weight and gender, which you’ve likely already entered on your Garmin profile. It can even offer calorie and macronutrient recommendations tailored to your fitness goals.</p>
<p>However, it unveiled the news at CES 2026, a tech conference held in Las Vegas, which seemed like a troll. Las Vegas, where you’re never far from a three-foot margarita, a BLT Bloody Mary or fried chicken and waffles. In fact, Garmin selected one of my favorite restaurants, Yardbird, to showcase its new nutrition-tracking feature. Yardbird does incredible chicken and waffles. It’s possibly the worst possible place to start monitoring my calorie intake, regardless of the 15,000-odd steps I take each day here.</p>
<p>In addition to the food database, you can use the camera to log food. With AI-powered image recognition, the Connect app makes a generally good guess at what you’re eating. During the media briefing lunch, the app swiftly recognized grilled salmon, corn and several other vegetables. The quantities were not remotely accurate, however: Five kernels of corn do not equate to one cup. You can manually adjust the serving size, but unfortunately, it can’t make a more informed estimate at this point. A Garmin spokesperson noted that the company is looking into how to improve accuracy here. (It’s a common issue for any app or service attempting to use AI image detection to analyse meals.) It was, however, quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also create customized meal entries (with the correct ingredient quantities), making it easier to track your regular breakfast habits or midday coffee order. Better still, you can monitor nutrition and calorie intake on compatible Garmin watches. You can even log your favorite (and recently logged foods from your wrist without needing to use your phone. Voice commands also work on compatible Garmin wearables.</p>
<p>The feature is now available to Garmin Connect+ subscribers, who pay $6.99 per month. This also includes Active Intelligence, which already offers AI-powered insights into your workouts. It can now factor in your nutrition.</p>
<p>Subscribers will also be able to get daily, weekly, monthly and even annual reports on calorie targets (and what you ended up consuming). But let’s start monitoring that once I’ve left Vegas, please.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/garmin-food-tracking-feature-connect-plus-ces-2026-043231948.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OhSnap <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/i-adore-this-clever-mobile-gamepad-with-hall-effect-sticks-and-a-snap-up-design-110007990.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">won our hearts</a> (and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2025-the-best-tech-and-gadgets-we-saw-in-las-vegas-211535722.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a best of CES award</a>) last year with the MCON, its tiny Bluetooth game pad that magnetically connects to your phone. At the time, we tried a pre-production unit, but in the year since the MCON has been finalized and went on sale last month. I just got a chance to try the final version here at CES, and just a quick demo was enough to convince me that OhSnap has made some solid refinements over the last year.</p><p>Just as we saw last year, the MCON attaches magnetically to an iPhone or any compatible Android phone (the company also includes a magnetic ring in the box for Androids that don’t have Qi2 yet). It has the full array of controls, including four face buttons, a D-pad, two joysticks and index finger buttons and full bumpers. It’s just sleeker and feels more solid than last year’s prototype, and while mounting your makes it feel a bit top-heavy, it’s not awkward enough to cause real issues when playuing (at least that’s how I felt after my brief demo).</p><p>The controller also has grips that unfold to help balance things, and the plate that attaches your phone to the controller has a kickstand. So if you want to drop your phone down on a tray table on a plane and play just holding the controller, feel free. All in all, the MCON feels like a flexible and high-quality device that’s probably worth the $150 OhSnap asks for it.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF8995.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF8995.jpg" style="height:1353px;width:2400px;" alt="The MCON dock connects your phone to your TV for full-screen gameplay." data-uuid="24ca9326-6388-44bc-a72d-da6d047386c7"/><figcaption>The MCON dock connects your phone to your TV for full-screen gameplay.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The company also has some new accessories to show off. There’s a $70 TV dock that powers your phone and outputs video from USB-C to HDMI. You could use this dock with any Bluetooth controller hooked up to your mobile phone, not just the MCON. There’s also a tiny $30 adapter you can put on your keychain that has a USB-C plug that goes into your phone; plug an HDMI cable into the other end and you can broadcast your games to a TV anywhere you go and play them with a controller.</p><p>It’s a pretty clever and comprehensive set of products, and while there are tons of mobile game controllers, the OhSnap feels like one of the more portable and sleek options out there. OhSnap is working on something even slimmer, though. The company showed off two new prototype controllers, the MCON Lite and MCON Slim. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9017.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9017.jpg" style="height:1353px;width:2400px;" alt="OhSnap is working on two new MCON controller that are more compact than the original." data-uuid="54f99c98-d417-48c0-8b67-06979d847800"/><figcaption>OhSnap is working on two new MCON controller that are more compact than the original.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As the names suggest, they’re both more compact than the original model. The Lite uses concave joypads rather than full sticks, and the Slim makes things even smaller by using concave touch pads. Your’e not going to get quite the same quality experience with those as you would with the bigger version, but they are noticeably thinner; OhSnap says they’ll be cheaper, too.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New tech at CES often makes categorization hard. Is Cozyla’s latest device a digital family calendar, a TV or a smart home hub? After seeing it, I’d say the answer is, yes? Cozyla calls the Calendar + Max the “largest interactive hub in it’s category.” And indeed, it’s the size of a big flatscreen, but the main interface is just like any other Cozyla device, an Android-based family calendar and planner with shared schedules, notes, meal plans, and chores. It syncs with Google, Yahoo and Apple calendars as well as Outlook, and it will run apps from the Google Play store. (Yahoo owns Engadget, but has no say in our editorial coverage.)</p>
<p>But this super-sized version can also stream shows and movies with whichever apps you subscribe to. The photo integration, via the app, will take pics from your phone and stick them on the bigs screen. You can also create a slideshow and photo walls to look at when the calendar is off. </p>
<p>The smart home integration lets you view your security camera and video doorbell feeds on a much larger scale than your phone’s display can offer. The display has a camera of its own so you can make FaceTime and Zoom calls. </p>
<p>The Max comes on a built-in stand that you can roll around the house, along with a battery that should power the whole thing for around six hours. When I first heard about it, I found myself wondering where I would put Calendar+ Max in my house. The kitchen is an ideal centralized calendar location, but I don’t want to watch <em>Miss Scarlet</em> in there. Luckily, the wheels make that conundrum moot. This can go anywhere you want it to, and swings into portrailt orientation that looks great for chore mode, and landscape orientation for watching shows. </p>
<p>Possibly the best part is the lack of subscription required. Like with all Cozyla screens, there’s no ongoing cost to use all the features. The Calendar + Max has no release date or price available just yet, but if I ever decided to organize my family’s life beyond barely contained chaos, I can see myself considering it. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Projector maker XGIMI has turned up at CES to launch its own range of AR glasses, but don’t get the champagne out too soon. MemoMind is a new brand under which its AI-infused eyewear will be sold, with two distinct units arriving at some point in the near future. The company says it has leveraged its know-how in optics and engineering to produce glasses which are unobtrusively light, all the better for blending into your daily life. Fashionistas will even be overjoyed to learn the glasses’ ship in eight different frame styles, five different temple designs and can be worn with prescription lenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Memo One is the company’s flagship option, with dual-eye displays and integrated speakers so you can see and hear your AI assistant. The Memo Air, meanwhile, is a more stripped down model&nbsp; weighing just 28.9 grams which just has a single eye display. <s>Unfortunately, the company is using microLED displays rather than waveguides, making them a far harder sell for a lot of would-be users. After all, putting something that small so close to your eye but behind your prescription means it’s a painful experience for short sighted folks to focus on text. As I explained in my </s><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/halliday-glasses-review-ambitious-smart-glasses-with-frustrating-flaws-130000207.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><s>Halliday review</s></a><s>, this technology is no friend to the glasses wearers who would otherwise be the ideal early adopters.</s></p><p><strong>Update Jan 5, 2026:</strong> I have never been so happy to post an update, as I have now seen these in person and learned that they do not use microLED displays. In fact, they <em>do</em> use waveguides, making them a lot more attractive than I had initially thought. In fact, the glasses they remind me the most of is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/even-realities-g1-review-limited-but-effective-smart-glasses-140059586.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Even Realities’ G1, which I reviewed</a> and absolutely loved.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/20251218-110941_%281%29.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/20251218-110941_%281%29.png" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="MemoMind Lineup" data-uuid="97258fc3-192a-4976-be81-8062f6573f6a"/><figcaption>MemoMind Lineup</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">XGIMI</div></figure><p>In fact there are plenty of similarities, including the fact you need to tilt your head up to activate them. The waveguide prisms are a lot taller here, giving you plenty more real estate for your important data. To the point where the homescreen was set to include a full stock tracker (with graphs) and still had room for the time and notification pane. </p><p>They’re also surprisingly light, despite the fact the model I tested was the feature-packed flagship as opposed to the display free version. </p><p>The glasses are just a vehicle for the company’s AI assistant, promising translation, summarization, note-taking, reminders and contextual guidance. Unlike some of its would-be rivals, XGIMI says its platform will switch between OpenAI, Azure and (Alibaba’s) Qwen depending on what it thinks will offer you the best result for each task. Naturally, we’ll need to get them in to test before passing final judgment on their qualities but, you can color us naturally hostile to those damn microLEDs until we’re convinced otherwise.</p><p>XGIMI says the flagship Memo One will be available to pre-order “soon,” most likely after MWC in March. It’ll cost $599, with prescription lenses available for an additional, as yet unspecified charge, and the other models coming further down the line.</p><p><em>This story was updated to rectify incorrect information from the company’s press release.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/xgimi-best-known-for-projectors-launches-its-own-smart-glasses-170000968.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After relaunching its Area-51 brand with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-16-area-51-review-a-fully-retooled-gaming-mothership-150000871.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a new 16-inch laptop in 2025</a>, Alienware is teasing two new laptops at CES 2026 in an attempt to reach an even larger audience. Dell&#39;s gaming brand plans to launch both entry-level and ultra-slim models later this year, and in the meantime, it&#39;s rolling out updates to its existing desktops and laptops to tide people over.</p><p>Alienware isn&#39;t sharing all the details of its new laptops at CES, but we do have the highlights. The company&#39;s new &quot;ultra-slim gaming laptop&quot; will be around 17mm or 0.67 inches thin, and come in either 14-inch or 16-inch variants. While the 16-inch version of the laptop will feature NVIDIA discrete graphics and &quot;new highly efficient CPUs,&quot; it&#39;s not meant to be a gaming powerhouse like the Area-51. Instead, Alienware suggests the laptop will work for gaming and also &quot;creative projects, productivity and everything in between.&quot;</p><p>The entry-level laptop is similarly not at Area-51-levels of power, but Alienware claims it&#39;ll deliver &quot;strong gaming performance&quot; at its &quot;most accessible price point yet.&quot; That should ideally put the new laptop under the $1,199 starting price of the more streamlined Alienware 16 Aurora laptop.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Alienware-Area-51-Desktop-AMD-chips.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Alienware-Area-51-Desktop-AMD-chips.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The updated version of the Alienware Area-51 Desktop with AMD chips." data-uuid="c620707c-f3dc-458e-9fca-b56367f85ab6"/><figcaption>The Alienware Area-51 Desktop will get updated with the latest AMD chips in February 2026.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>On top of those two new models, Alienware is bringing new anti-glare OLED panels to a selection of its Alienware 16X Aurora and Alienware 16 Area-51 laptops, along with new Intel Core Ultra 200HX chips. The new display panels reach 620 nits of peak HDR brightness and have a 0.2ms response time for even smoother gameplay. The Alienware 18 Area-51 is also getting an upgrade to Intel Core Ultra 200HX chips, while the Alienware Area-51 Desktop will ship with AMD&#39;s new Ryzen 7 9850X3D chips.</p><p>There&#39;s currently no pricing available for Alienware&#39;s new laptops, or the updated versions of its older models. The updated Alienware 16X Aurora, Alienware 16 Area-51, and Alienware 18 Area-51 laptops will be available in Q1 2026. The update Alienware Area-51 Desktop is coming in February 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-teases-new-super-slim-and-entry-level-gaming-laptops-at-ces-2026-033000700.html?src=rss]]></description>

For most consumers, NPU speeds don&#39;t really mean much yet, but if you&#39;re running AI models on your system you can expect slightly faster inferencing from AMD&#39;s previous chips.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-05_at_9.06.28%E2%80%AFAM.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-05_at_9.06.28%E2%80%AFAM.jpg" style="height:1077px;width:2000px;" alt="AMD Ryzen AI 400 chips" data-uuid="0a4dd42d-013a-4cfd-abee-09d913bc11b0"/><figcaption>AMD Ryzen AI 400 chips</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p>The top-end Ryzen AI 9 HX 475 offers up to 12 Zen 5 CPU cores, 5.2GHz max boost speeds and up to 8,533 MT/s memory speeds.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember, I&#39;ve always wanted to have a keyboard computer -- that is, a computer where the entire machine was stuffed inside of a keyboard. Maybe I caught a glimpse of the Commodore 64 at an impressionable age, but for whatever reason, the idea has always intrigued me. Now HP is bringing the concept back with its new EliteBoard G1a &quot;Next Gen AI PC.&quot; </p><p>It&#39;s an IT administrator&#39;s dream: It looks a typical desktop keyboard, but it has the full power of a Copilot+ AI PC inside. You can equip it with Ryzen 5 or 7 CPUs and their embedded Radeon 800 GPUs, up to 64GB of RAM and as much as 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. All you need to do is add a monitor and a mouse, and you&#39;ve got a full-fledged desktop setup.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-1.jpg" style="height:1152px;width:2000px;" alt="HP EliteBoard keyboard PC." data-uuid="439d1f0c-eb33-45fe-85b1-738f81cb1276"/><figcaption>HP EliteBoard keyboard PC.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The more I think about it, the more sad I am that the arc of the computing industry trended towards standardized desktops and laptops. There was a brief spark of interest with the UMPC (ultra mobile PC) trend in the 2000&#39;s, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-09-29-meet-the-second-generation-of-umpcs-shoulda-been-first.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Engadget covered extensively as a young blog</a>, as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-03-03-hands-on-with-asus-eee-keyboard.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ASUS&#39;s Eee keyboard</a>. But they couldn&#39;t survive the rise of the smartphone and tablet. It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard. </p><p>I was able to test out an early EliteBoard prototype, and while the experience wasn&#39;t perfect, it&#39;s still an intriguing computing option. I had trouble setting it up initially because it only had two USB-C ports on its rear, which meant I had to find a way to power it through one port and pass a video signal through the other.  Thankfully, my Anker USB-C charging hub was able to juice it up, and I also had a USB-C hub with an HDMI port, which allowed me to connect to my monitor.</p><p>Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC. Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-30-intel-compute-stick-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Intel&#39;s Compute Stick placed a functional PC in a much smaller case</a>, but unlike the failed product, the EliteBoard actually felt usable. I was able to load up several browser windows with tabs, edit a few photos and even play a few light games, like <em>Vampire Survivors. </em>And yes, typing on it felt pretty great too.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-3.jpg" style="height:1119px;width:2000px;" alt="HP EliteBoard keyboard PC." data-uuid="c8b26cc3-4e39-48a1-b2a2-3a7144417589"/><figcaption>HP EliteBoard keyboard PC.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Since I was testing out prototype hardware, I agreed not to benchmark the EliteBoard. But from the performance I saw, it felt about the same an entry-level laptop. Basically, it&#39;s perfectly suited to its main task: Being a boring office computer. Back in my IT days, I certainly would have preferred deploying a few light keyboards instead of the tank-like Dell desktops we typically ordered.</p><p>While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC. There&#39;s a chance we could see one that&#39;s eventually meant for mainstream consumers. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s exactly, necessary, though. The whole concept of a desktop PC mainly appeals to tinkerers and IT folks. And for anyone who wants to get their hands on an EliteBoard soon, there&#39;s really nothing stopping you.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/hps-eliteboard-made-me-believe-in-keyboard-computers-again-033000955.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>French startup NAOX is at CES with a groundbreaking wearable <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/muses-new-wearable-eeg-knows-how-hard-youre-thinking-120041154.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">EEG</a> for clinics and research, but that’s not what we’re interested in today. Because it’s also here showing off a prototype of the consumer version, which incorporates its brain-scanning technology in wireless earbuds. As early as the end of this year, your earbuds could pull double-duty, pumping out tunes and keeping an eye on your brain’s health.</p><p>The product being released today is the NAOX Link NX01, an in-ear EEG designed to replace the wire-covered caps you’ve seen at a sleep clinic. It’s designed to be much more convenient for use in long-term studies, enabling people to keep an eye on their health while on the go. Don’t think you’ll be able to mess with one of these yourself as it is targeted toward clinical environments.</p><p>Of more interest is the NAOX Wave, which uses the same in-ear EEG technology from Link, but in a pair of wireless earbuds. As with the clinical model, Wave is designed to quietly keep an eye on your brain’s biomarkers as you go about your day. The company says it’ll be able to monitor your mental activity while working, relaxing and sleeping. In the companion app, you’ll get insights about your mental health, sleep analytics and cognitive performance, as well as details on your brain’s age.&nbsp;</p><p>NAOX has said its version of the buds will launch towards the end of 2026, but it may not be the only name selling this tech. The company says it is interested in licensing its technology to audio companies, so we could see these EEGs popping up in earbuds from other, more established brands.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/naoxs-wireless-earbuds-have-a-built-in-eeg-to-monitor-your-brain-health-030000605.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Urinalysis company Vivoo has rocked up at CES 2026 with two new products designed to keep an eye on your health. The first is the Smart Toilet, which clips onto your bowl and uses optical sensors to monitor your hydration levels.</p>
<p>It’s an evolution of the smart toilet product it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vivoo-smart-toilet-clip-on-device-urine-test-190518742.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">originally announced back in 2023</a>, which used a reactive testing strip as part of its process. Here, that feature has been ditched in favor of just collecting a small sample in its pocket-shaped cup for non-contact testing before being released.</p>
<p>The optical sensors in question are designed to track your urine’s specific gravity to monitor how hydrated you are. (If urine is too dense, it’s a sign of dehydration, while if it’s too thin, it’s a sign of over-hydration or something more serious, like diabetes or renal failure.)</p>

<p>You trigger a reading via the smartphone app, and when the test is complete the data will be pushed back to your device. The company says its battery will last for more than 1,000 measurements before you need to recharge it, too.</p>
<p>Vivoo doesn’t (Withings) name (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-hands-ces-225415240.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Withings</a>) names (Withings) but throws a sharp elbow toward its competitor. It boasts that its product will last for 1,000 tests on a single charge, “vastly exceeding the handful of monthly readings offered by chemical cartridge-based tests.” And that its battery pack, which sits on the outside of the toilet bowl, means you won’t need to uninstall the sensor to recharge and clean it on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, the company is announcing Hygenic FlowPad, a menstrual pad infused with microfluidics. These are capable of monitoring factors such as Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSI), a marker for fertiity, ovarian health and perimenopause. Once the wearer removes the pad, they are tasked with scanning it with their phone camera to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vivoos-new-at-home-uti-test-kit-and-app-can-tell-you-if-you-have-a-urinary-tract-infection-030021462.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Vivoo’s app, much like many of its other at-home tests</a>. At present, there’s no word on when FlowPad will be available to buy, but the company hopes to charge $4-5 per pad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vivoo’s Smart Toilet can be ordered today, with early birds getting the gear for $99 with no need for an additional subscription, due to ship March. A second batch on the same deal arrives in June, but latecomers will have to wait until September 2026 when it goes on general sale. At that point, the price will climb to $129, plus an additional $6 a month for the subscription.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll be able to watch more live sports programming on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-new-apple-tv-and-peacock-streaming-bundle-is-officially-available-170403587.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Peacock</a> that supports Dolby Vision and Atmos starting this year. At the moment, the only live sports offering you can enjoy with Atmos on the service is <em>Sunday Night Football</em>. Now, Dolby Laboratories has announced at CES that Peacock is expanding the availability of Dolby Vision and Atmos across live sports over the coming year. Peacock will add support for both technologies to <em>Sunday Night Football, </em>NBA and MLB live sporting events that the streaming service will offer its subscribers. </p><p>“Our partnership with Dolby ensures that whether our subscribers are streaming a thrilling playoff game, the latest Universal blockbuster, or a critically acclaimed Peacock Original, they&#39;re experiencing it exactly as creators intended — with breathtaking picture and immersive sound that brings every moment to life,” said David Bohunek, Senior Vice President of Global Video Engineering at NBCUniversal. </p><p>The companies have also announced that Peacock will start supporting <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-announces-dolby-vision-2-expanding-picture-quality-beyond-hdr-123019504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Dolby Vision 2</a> and Dolby AC-4 starting later this year.  Dolby Laboratories called Vision 2 “a groundbreaking evolution of its industry-leading picture quality innovation” when it announced the technology at IFA 2025. It was designed with today’s TV technology in mind, and it uses AI to automatically adjust your TV based on what you’re watching and where you&#39;re watching it. Meanwhile, AC-4 is a new audio format that Dolby says can deliver the highest audio quality “at a much lower bandwidth than other formats.” </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/peacock-is-expanding-dolby-vision-and-atmos-availability-for-live-sports-023000794.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Smartglasses company Rokid has introduced new display-free AI glasses at CES 2026. Dubbed &quot;Style&quot;, the glasses are intended for all-day use and are compatible with users&#39; corrective prescriptions.</p>
<p>Style supports multiple AI engines, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek, instead of being locked to any LLM. The glasses can also work with Google Maps and Microsoft AI translation.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Style is powered by a dual-chip setup, with an NXP RT600 handling low-power, always-on tasks and a Qualcomm AR1 taking on heavier AI and imaging workloads. Rokid claims this architecture helps it reach up to 12 hours of battery life under typical use.</p>
<p>A 12MP camera with a Sony sensor on the front supports 4K capture. Video can be shot in three different aspect ratios, which Rokid says makes it easier for creators to make content for different platforms. Style can record up to 10 minutes of continuous footage, which Rokid is quick to point out exceeds the roughly three-minute limit on Meta Ray-Bans.</p>
<p>The glasses weigh 38.5 grams and sport ultra-thin lenses with anti-scratch coatings. Style is a bit lighter than the Rokid smartglasses that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/rokids-smartglasses-are-surprisingly-capable-153027590.html"><ins>we reviewed</ins></a> earlier this year, which include a display.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Relaxing&quot; isn&#39;t a word anyone is likely to associate with CES. If anything, it is the antithesis of CES, an exhausting and wildly overstimulating marathon event that takes place in the already exhausting and wildly overstimulating Las Vegas. But a demo of Ambient&#39;s bedside device, Dreamie, ahead of its appearance at CES-adjacent Pepcom had me properly lulled and ready to go right back to bed. Dreamie is a smart sunrise alarm clock and nighttime wind-down device that has a built-in podcast player, a catalog of green, pink and brown noise sound masks, guided breathing programs, contactless motion sensors to provide insights into your sleep habits, dynamic lighting with simulated sunrise wake-ups and Bluetooth connectivity for headphones.</p>
<p>But most importantly for anyone trying to avoid using their phone immediately before bed, it&#39;s a standalone system in which all controls, features and scheduling options as well as data storage are on-device. And there&#39;s no subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of Dreamie is &quot;to help you separate from your phone while providing a lot of the conveniences that you would normally have,&quot; said CEO and co-founder Adrian Canoso. You can set multiple alarms on different schedules, access soothing content to fall asleep to and customize how gradual your sunrise wakeup is. There are environmental sensors to clue you in on the humidity, temperature and lighting conditions over the course of the night, to give you a better idea of how these things may be affecting your sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dreamie is a relatively small device compared to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hatch-restore-2-review-better-sleep-behind-a-paywall-130028052.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">other sunrise-style clocks</a>, with a truncated pill-shaped body and a sleek circular touchscreen. Around the display is a hidden dial for volume control, and it feels great to rotate, with just the right amount of resistance. There&#39;s also a touch strip on top of the device to easily adjust the dimness of the light by dragging your finger along it. From the display, you can even change the direction the light is pointing so you don&#39;t blast yourself (or your partner) with it when your eyes aren&#39;t ready, casting the light off to the back instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its 20-LED array can go from a soft, warm orangey glow to cool and bright blue-white, and certain programs, like the aurora borealis soundscape, will trigger other colors of the rainbow, throwing soothing green, blue and magenta. More impressive is the rich sound that comes from its 50 millimeter speaker. Dreamie has a 360-degree speaker grille on the bottom of the device that sends sound in all directions to create more immersive ambient sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a speaker is pointing toward you, &quot;it&#39;s almost like a laser beam coming at you,&quot; which isn&#39;t exactly the most relaxing experience, explained Canoso, who previously worked in industrial design and robotics, and before that, as a studio recording engineer. &quot;[Dreamie] projects the sound all the way around… So when you put it next to you on a night table, it sounds more diffused. It&#39;s not the loudest speaker out there because we&#39;ve optimized it for rich sound quality at lower volumes. We don&#39;t need it loud. We just need it to sound good.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And sound good, it does. It&#39;s seriously got me thinking I may finally have found the thing to replace the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B075S53HD9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e95a8f19-9e7b-4662-8bf7-4679e03ced4a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Philips+Wake-Up+Light&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAc6CbLMYoj0gzVpGqYP4kP6acGcPHI7NVmyQeUhtJBQE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Wake-up-Therapy-HF3650-60%2Fdp%2FB075S53HD9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Wake-up-Therapy-HF3650-60/dp/B075S53HD9">Philips Wake-Up Light</a> I&#39;ve been clinging to for close to 10 years now that has decent lighting but absolutely abysmal sound quality.</p>
<p>Dreamie, which costs $250, recently started shipping after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and certain features — including podcasts and sleep insights — haven&#39;t launched just yet (though I did get to see the podcast library during the demonstration, so it is a real thing, and it’s expected to roll out later this month). Those and other future features will arrive via free over-the-air updates.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Dell killed off all of its PC brands</a>, including the iconic XPS lineup, and replaced them with a simplified naming scheme. It was a move meant to make it easier for people to discern between the company&#39;s many brands, but in reality, it just just made the company&#39;s lineup even more confusing. We called it an unforced error at the time, but after seeing how much Dell&#39;s PC market share fell over 2025, it&#39;s fair to say that rebranding was an absolute marketing disaster. </p><p>So, with its tail between its legs, Dell has returned to CES some welcome news for its fans: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">XPS lives</a>! And the company plans to double-down on the brand in ways it never did before. Today, Dell revealed the new XPS 14 and 16 notebooks, which feature a more practical design than the previous models. There&#39;s a new function row with traditional keys, instead of the odd capacitive buttons that disappeared in sunlight. And while the company is sticking with its &quot;invisible&quot; trackpad, which sits flush alongside the wrist rest, there&#39;s now a light border around the edges that lets you feel exactly where the trackpad begins and ends.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>So, in short, Dell seems to have solved most of our recent complaints about the XPS lineup. To signify its commitment to the brand, it&#39;s also emblazoning the XPS logo on all of these new machines, replacing the previous Dell name. That’s something I could never imagine a less humbled Dell doing. </p><p>The redesign also gave Dell room to shave off some weight and thickness from both machines. The XPS 14 weighs around three pounds now, a half-pound lighter than the previous generation, while the XPS 16 weighs 3.6 pounds, a whole pound lighter than before. The new cases make both machines look a lot more like Microsoft’s extra-subtle Surface Laptop, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Both systems are powered by Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 chips, and they also offer tandem OLED display options.</p><p>Dell also briefly teased the return of a new XPS 13 later this year, which is set to be the company’s thinnest and lightest notebook ever.  Dell says it’ll be cheaper than the XPS has been in the past.</p><p>The new XPS 14 and 16 will be available on January 6, starting at $1,650 and $1,850, respectively. </p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html?src=rss]]></description>

And that, for the first time, the silicon has been certified for embedded and industrial use cases, including robotics and smart cities. But, like so many stories about Intel these days, the launch is loaded with so much subtext you’ll need a copy of Cliffs Notes to understand it.</p><p>On the face of it, these are just some snappy flagship chips, available in Core Ultra 7 and 9 ranges as well as Core X7 and X9, which ship with 12 Xe graphics cores over the usual four. Almost all of them offer 16 total cores and threads, and all bar two have total NPU performance of 50 PTOPS.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IntelCore3.jpeg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IntelCore3.jpeg" style="height:1939px;width:1986px;" alt="Image of the Core Ultra Series 3" data-uuid="8e0a72d8-307e-4b02-9236-e7e7e8ee94c6"/><figcaption>Image of the Core Ultra Series 3</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>These chips are going to be famous for two key reasons: First, Intel claims they’re the most advanced chips ever manufactured in the US. Second, they’re the first to be made using Intel’s long awaited 18A process, which has dogged the company for several years. 18A was a key plank of former CEO Pat Gelsinger’s rescue plan to restore Intel to the top of the chip world.

Behold, the ROG Flow Z13-KJP, a collaboration between ASUS and Kojima Productions.</p><p>On the inside, this model is no different than the standard version <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-flow-z13-2025-review-when-a-traditional-gaming-laptop-just-wont-do-133510833.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">we reviewed</a> last May. The device takes a Surface Pro-like form factor and beefs it up into something that’s more like a gaming laptop. (Ergo, ASUS&#39;s pitch of the product as a &quot;gaming tablet.&quot;)</p><p>But on the outside, you&#39;ll find a design &quot;for Ludens who dare.&quot; The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Death Stranding</a> influence is evident, but you may pick up on some Metal Gear-adjacent touches as well. The tablet&#39;s gold color, symbols and integrated carbon fiber conjure Kojima’s Ludens mascot. This variant is slightly larger than the standard one, most noticeably in the detachable keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/asus_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/asus_2.jpg" style="height:1688px;width:3000px;" alt="Marketing image of the ROG Flow Z13-KJP 2-in-1 with accessories" data-uuid="6ff34a0b-bca1-4273-9c49-5d45f7ac0a84"/><figcaption>ROG Flow Z13-KJP</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>There will also be matching accessories available, including a mouse, case, headphones and a desk mat. Depending on your region, those may or may not be bundled with the device. (We&#39;ll update this story when we find out more.)</p><p>Fortunately, once the design novelty wears off, you&#39;re left with a fairly powerful gaming machine. The Copilot PC has a 13.4-inch IPS touchscreen with a 180Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of brightness. Its port selection is surprisingly generous: two USB 4 Type-C ports, one USB-A port, HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm audio and a microSD slot. The Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip inside has integrated graphics that punch above what you&#39;d expect. You can configure it with up to 128GB LPDDR5X 8000 RAM.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG_Flow_z13-KJP_One_Pager.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG_Flow_z13-KJP_One_Pager.png" style="height:1734px;width:2842px;" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 one-page feature roundup" data-uuid="c4ee928c-0b7d-4617-9eaa-458c18831de1"/><figcaption>More Kojima than you ever expected from a &quot;gaming tablet&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t yet revealed pricing or availability for the ROG Flow Z13-KJP.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A couple years ago ASUS made its first dual-screen laptop in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-specs-price-the-first-dual-screen-laptop-worth-buying-130016756.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ZenBook Duo</a>. Now at CES 2026, the company has taken that idea and branched off in a somewhat unexpected way with the ROG Zephyrus Duo, which might just be the world’s first true dual-screen gaming laptop.</p><p>Unlike a more traditional productivity notebook with two built-in displays, the concept of a dual-screen gaming notebook doesn’t translate quite as naturally because powering two screens comes with a performance hit. Plus, in the heat of battle, it’s not like you have a lot of opportunity to utilize that second monitor. But if you view this Zephyrus Duo as more of an all-purpose portable content creation and gaming station, things begin to make a lot more sense.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="018e96ab-b1d3-45b6-b443-4f848503a00b"/><p>Both of Zephyrus Duo’s 16-inch Nebula OLED panels have strong specs including support for HDR with up to 1,100 nits of peak brightness, NVIDIA G-Sync, stylus integration and a very strong Delta-E (which measures color accuracy) of less than one. Performance also looks solid with ASUS offering the latest Core Ultra processors from Intel and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. Sure, with a TDP of 135 watts, the Zephyrus Duo won’t be quite as punchy as a comparable single-screened 16-inch gaming notebook, but those won’t be nearly as adaptable as the ROG either.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the Zenbook Duo, the Zephyrus Duo comes with a detachable wireless keyboard that can be charged up magnetically. This allows users to set up the laptop in all sorts of positions, which are enhanced thanks to a built-in kickstand. The one people will use the most is probably the stacked arrangement with one display above the other. However, you can also keep the Duo and clamshell mode, slide the keyboard forward for drawing, lay it down flat on a table or even put it into tent mode and game on it. Though even ASUS admits that may not be super practical as apps will need to specifically support that use case. Though at the very least, you can mirror your screen for a friend on the other side of a desk/table.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Zephyrus-duo-back.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Zephyrus-duo-back.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The ROG Zephyrus Duo comes with a built-in kickstand which makes it easy to set it up in all sorts of different positions, even if it is a bit heavy.

But ASUS managed to do a good job of keeping it relatively thin (0.77 inches) without skimping on features like sound thanks to the Duo’s six-speaker stereo system and cooling which features a vapor chamber and a liquid metal thermal material. You also get a surprising amount of ports including multiple USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.1 and a full-size SD card slot, plus a decently large 90Whr battery.&nbsp;</p><p>The one important thing we don’t know yet though is how much it will cost, particularly because this thing almost certainly won’t be cheap (I’m guessing a starting price of around $2,500). A dual-screen gaming laptop might not make a lot of sense, but I appreciate how ambitious ASUS is being with the ROG Zephyrus Duo and I’m looking forward to testing it out sometime later this year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html?src=rss]]></description>

The robotics company says the final product version of the robot is being built now, and the first companies that will receive deployments are Hyundai, Boston Dynamics&#39; majority shareholder, and Google DeepMind, the firm&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-google-deepmind-form-new-ai-partnership/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">newly minted AI partner.</a></p><p>This final enterprise version of Atlas &quot;can perform a wide array of industrial tasks,&quot; according to Boston Dynamics, and is specifically designed with consistency and reliability in mind. Atlas can work autonomously, via a teleoperator or with &quot;a tablet steering interface,&quot; and the robot is both strong and durable. Boston Dynamics says Atlas has a reach of up to 7.5 feet, the ability to lift 110 pounds and can operate at temperatures ranging from minus 4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. &quot;This is the best robot we have ever built,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said in the Atlas announcement. &quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Boston Dynamics has been publicly demoing its work on humanoid robots since at least 2011, when <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-12-darpa-atlas.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">it first debuted Atlas</a> as a DARPA project. Since then, the robot has gone through multiple prototypes and revisions, most notably switching from a hydraulic design to an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-unveils-an-all-electric-version-of-its-atlas-robot-151513244.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">all-electric design</a> in 2024. Later that year, Boston Dynamics <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-can-now-pick-car-parts-on-its-own-170052539.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">demonstrated</a> the robot&#39;s ability to manipulate car parts, which appears to be one of the first ways Atlas will be put to work.</p><p>Hyundai <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-can-now-pick-car-parts-on-its-own-170052539.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">plans to use Atlas</a> in its car plants in 2028, focused on tasks like parts sequencing. In 2030, the car maker hopes to have the robot&#39;s responsibilities &quot;extend to component assembly, and over time, Atlas will also take on tasks involving repetitive motions, heavy loads, and other complex operations,&quot; Hyundai says. Google DeepMind, meanwhile, is receiving Atlas robots so it can work on integrating its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepminds-latest-ai-model-can-help-robots-fold-origami-and-close-ziploc-bags-151455249.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Gemini Robotics</a> AI foundation models into Boston Dynamics&#39; system. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-announces-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047772.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year when Dell decided to kill off the XPS name, it felt like a big mistake. In fact, we <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-killing-the-xps-name-is-an-unforced-error-200006195.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">said so</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">multiple</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">times</a>. But at CES 2026, Dell is righting wrongs by bringing back its iconic laptop brand and it feels like the right move for both the company and its flagship consumer devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more than the words the letters XPS are meant to represent (Extreme Performance Systems), over the last decade, Dell’s signature laptop brand stood for excellent design, quality engineering and top notch performance. And it was precisely those laptops that landed the company at the top of nearly every best Windows laptop guide every year for the last decade. So to replace XPS with a generic tag like premium felt like a big step backwards.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Now if you were living under a rock (at least when it comes to Windows laptops), you can sort of squint your eyes and see the reasoning behind Dell’s misguided rebranding. Premium means good, typically something much better than average. By putting that word in front of its top-tier systems, there’s no way anyone could be confused about what kind of device they were buying, right? Take for example the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Dell Premium 14</a>, which was the new moniker for what was previously called the XPS 14. A laptop like that has to be decent. I mean, it’s right there in the product name. The issue is that XPS already meant good. Actually, way better than that, if we were just going by the sheer number of accolades previous-gen models got, like Dell’s 2020-era machines which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">we called practically perfect</a> (which it was). Going away from that wasn’t just reductive, it was throwing the best part of Dell’s consumer business in the trash for no real reason.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The first two new XPS machines will be the XPS 14 and XPS 16.

COO Jeff Clarke was refreshingly honest about this when announcing the return of XPS at a CES media preview in early December. Not only did Dell lose its signature XPS brand last year, it actually made things more confusing for consumers when it simultaneously created a full range of Dell Pro and Pro Max systems. Unlike Apple’s MacBook Pros and iPhone Pro Maxes, those devices were actually meant for enterprise customers instead of regular Joes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16-2.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Another photo of the new XPS 14 and 16, which have a bunch of welcome changes and then some. " data-uuid="66338a00-e72a-493e-b697-804a589294bb"/><figcaption>Another photo of the new XPS 14 and 16, which have a bunch of welcome changes and then some. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Amidst its rebrand, the company also eliminated a lot of its budget and entry-level models. That left a lot of people turning to more <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-16-plus-2-in-1-review-technically-proficient-but-lacking-soul-153003908.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">expensive mid-range “Plus” systems</a> or waiting for a proper redesign of its top tier Premium laptops, which weren’t expected to arrive until 2026 anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>So where is Dell going from here? Well as Clarke put it quite succinctly, “We’re getting back to our roots.” Starting in 2026, the company is planning to create its broadest PC portfolio ever including, a full line of XPS laptops. This includes an all-new version of the XPS 13, which is going to be the thinnest and lightest model to date, along with complete overhauls for the XPS 14 and XPS 16. But Dell isn’t stopping there because on a slide it showed at its press event, there were two additional placeholders for future XPS systems coming at some later date.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-13-teaser-pic.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-13-teaser-pic.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Dell wouldn&#39;t let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here&#39;s a teaser it provided for CES. " data-uuid="c1a63d5a-a52d-4969-9e96-3f94eaab1489"/><figcaption>Dell wouldn&#39;t let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here&#39;s a teaser it provided for CES. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Even when it comes to specific features and components on individual models, Dell is finally acknowledging some of the criticism it has received over the past few years by returning to segmented touchpads instead of seamless all-glass slates and ditching capacitive function keys for good ‘ol buttons. Dell isn’t just bringing the XPS line back, it’s kind of on a revenge tour (even if the original wound was self-inflicted).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the consumer device team will be reporting directly to Clarke while the company retools itself internally. Dell is also updating its naming scheme to finally deliver on the promise of making things clear and simple. XPS will once again be the company’s flagship consumer brand with the XPS logo (not Dell’s) front and center on the lid of every laptop, while everything else will fall under the general Dell umbrella. Alienware will continue to do its own thing for gaming and the Dell Pro family will remain aimed strictly at enterprise businesses, professional services (like first responders) and education. No more confusion. And underlying all of that is a very straightforward motto from Clarke that “great products win.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EMBARGOED_UNTIL_JAN._5_%40_3pm_PT_-_Dell_Technologies_Branding_Snapshot.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EMBARGOED_UNTIL_JAN._5_%40_3pm_PT_-_Dell_Technologies_Branding_Snapshot.png" style="height:622px;width:1216px;" alt="After ditching the XPS brand, Dell is now bring it back for 2026 in its rightful spot at the top of the company&#39;s consumer portfolio.

Regardless of whether it&#39;s a corporation or a single person, admitting mistakes is always hard. Oftentimes, what you learn in the process is the real prize and from what I’ve seen Dell and its iconic XPS line is poised for a major comeback.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-amd-at-ces-2026">What to expect from AMD at CES 2026</h2>
<p>While AMD says it&#39;s keeping its product details under wraps, we <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html">can expect</a> &quot;updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the &quot;advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.&quot; That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever">better single-threaded performance</a> than its predecessors. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding AI, AMD could further discuss its new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-will-preview-its-redstone-upscaling-tech-on-december-10-174507324.html">FSR Redstone</a> technology, which it previously previewed on December 10. AMD&#39;s upscaling tech aims to close the gap on NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS 4, which was announced during CES 2025.</p>
<p>Su&#39;s presentation caps off CES&#39;s press day, so she&#39;ll be taking the stage in the hours after rivals <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130028668.html">NVIDIA</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-core-ultra-series-3-panther-lake-launch-event-130040881.html">Intel</a> present their chipmaking and AI plans to the world.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waymo is getting a good look at the competition as Uber revealed the design of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-and-lucids-robotaxis-will-debut-in-the-bay-area-in-2026-120000876.html">robotaxi</a> that&#39;s due to launch in San Francisco later this year. The upcoming robotaxi is a result of a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2025/Lucid-Nuro-and-Uber-Partner-on-Next-Generation-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Program/default.aspx">partnership</a> announced in July between Uber, Lucid and Nuro. The plan is still to deploy at least 20,000 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ubers-latest-robotaxi-plan-involves-20000-lucid-evs-145943920.html">Lucid EVs</a> that will use the Nuro Driver autonomous driving tech and be available through the Uber platform.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that the robotaxi reveal will be a &quot;production intent design,&quot; so there may be some modifications to the version that will eventually hit the streets. However, the partnership started on-road testing last month in the San Francisco Bay Area, with Nuro using more than 100 robotaxi prototypes supervised by autonomous vehicle operators.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The robotaxi, which is a modified <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-lucid-gravity-is-the-coolest-three-row-ev-on-the-market-120024089.html">Lucid Gravity</a>, will feature a multi-pronged sensor system, including high-res cameras, lidar sensors, and radar. The design also incorporates a halo mounted onto the EV&#39;s roof, which will increase sensor visibility and double as a display that uses LEDs to display helpful info to passengers.</p>
<p>As for the interior, Uber designed the &quot;in-vehicle rider experience,&quot; which can accommodate six passengers and luggage space. Inside, the robotaxi will have a display that lets you activate heated seats, adjust climate controls and throw on music, while also offering options for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-tesla-robotaxi-inexplicably-drove-into-a-parked-car-171004400.html">emergencies</a>, like contacting support or requesting the robotaxi to pull over. Even though the passenger isn&#39;t behind the wheel, the robotaxi&#39;s interactive screen will show its planned path in real-time and all the decisions it makes while driving, like interacting with pedestrians, traffic lights or lane changes.</p>
<p>The partnership said the design is still awaiting final validation, but that the robotaxi production is slated to start at Lucid&#39;s factory in Arizona later this year. Before its official launch in late 2026, Uber&#39;s robotaxi will be on display at CES 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-reveals-the-design-of-its-robotaxi-at-ces-2026-230056302.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Acer just announced the Predator Helios 16S AI gaming laptop at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a>. This computer is filled with both bells and whistles, making it a decent choice for modern gamers.</p>
<p>To that end, the laptop can be equipped with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H processor. This is Intel&#39;s upcoming flagship mobile processor that has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109046/intel-core-ultra-9-386h-panther-lake-cpu-loses-to-amds-flagship-strix-halo-apu-in-geekbench/index.html"><ins>previously been known as Panther Lake</ins></a>. The Helios 16S AI can also be outfitted with up to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU.</p>

<p>It comes with a 16-inch WQXGA OLED display that offers true HDR imaging support. The laptop can be loaded with up to 64GB of RAM and up to 2TB of storage. The connectivity here is on point, with support for Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth. Everything is housed in an 18.9mm slim metal chassis. It looks pretty solid.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have any pricing, and the company might still be calculating that, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://mashable.com/article/framework-price-hike-ddr5-ram-memory-shortage">given that ongoing RAM shortage</a>. Acer says they&#39;ll disclose that closer to launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/acers-predator-helios-neo-16s-ai-laptop-can-be-outfitted-with-intels-new-core-ultra-9-386h-cpu-230048825.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In addition to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html">huge TVs</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html">compact projectors</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-fully-unveils-its-galaxy-z-trifold-phone-and-itll-be-available-in-korea-in-a-few-days-010000499.html">Trifolds</a> and more, Samsung announced a new family of laptops at CES called the Galaxy Book 6 series. The company says it’s focused on what matters and on what you, hopefully, want in your next laptop. That means Intel’s latest chips, a cleaner design and battery life that lasts longer than a day. They’re really thin, too.</p>
<p>Timed alongside Intel’s CES announcements, the whole Galaxy Book 6 series features new Panther Lake chips, optimized by Samsung for three new laptops: The Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book 6 Ultra can be equipped with up to Core Ultra X9 processors and promises significant performance improvements, with a new 5th-generation MPU, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA’s RTX 50 series GPUs (with RTX 5070 and 5060 options). That package leads Samsung to promise up to 1.6x greater CPU power and 1.7x improved graphics performance compared to the last Galaxy Book series. (It’s worth noting that Samsung skipped an Ultra configuration of the Galaxy Book 5 series.)</p>
<p>All the laptops feature improved heat-management architecture, with a wider vapor chamber and re-engineered fans. At the same time, the Ultra features a new dual-path fan to cool the GPU even more efficiently and swiftly.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Book 6 Pro will come in 14- and 16-inch versions, with up to Core Ultra X7 processors and Intel Arc graphics. Both the Book 6 Ultra and Pro have improved AMOLED 2X (2,880 x 1,800) displays with touch, reaching up to 1000 nits of peak brightness — twice the brightness of the Book 5 Pro. Both models support adaptive refresh rates too, going up to 120Hz.</p>
<p>The Book 6 Ultra has a more typical laptop shape, while the Book 6 Pro has a teardrop profile, made famous by the MacBook Air.  Even if there’s some Apple inspiration, the Samsung laptops look great. Samsung has removed many unnecessary design elements. Although the Book 6 Ultra clings onto a USB-A port, it now (finally) has a full-size SD card reader, the lack of which was a major oversight on previous laptops.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9faf990-ea85-11f0-b7df-ee783fb6d841" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9faf990-ea85-11f0-b7df-ee783fb6d841" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on" data-uuid="e68af609-2d5c-36d3-a9f8-a9032ad5fb28"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Samsung has also tweaked the keyboard layout, though it’s too early to say whether it offers a significant improvement to the typing experience. It has added haptic trackpads to the Galaxy Book series for the first time too, although I found the one on my demo unit a little too hair-trigger sensitive to my touch. Thankfully, that’s something that can be addressed in the settings.</p>
<p>As you might notice from the photos, there are upward-firing speakers on either side of the keyboard. The Book 6 Ultra has six built-in speakers (four woofers, two tweeters) and has apparently balanced them symmetrically to reduce noise distortion.</p>
<p>Both laptops are slimmer than their predecessors, too. The Galaxy Book 6 Ultra is 15.4mm thick, while the Book 6 Pro is a svelte 11.9mm. Inside, Samsung has also enhanced heat management, including a wider vapour chamber and re-engineered fans, to ensure optimal performance during intensive tasks – apparently another priority for the Book 6 Series. Likewise, battery enclosures and placements have been re-engineered, and Samsung claims the new Book 6 Ultra and Pro can each deliver up to 30 hours of video playback. The Book 6 Ultra has the extra benefit of faster charging, reaching 63% in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a laptop launch in 2026 without AI features. Alongside the Book 6 series, Samsung highlighted a tool that uses AI to help create cut-outs of images for copy-and-pasting across devices, as well as a Note Assist feature to help collate and summarize your notes.</p>
<p>As is often the case at CES, Samsung hasn’t yet shared pricing or release dates for the Galaxy Book 6 series, so expect to hear more in the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MSI has presented its refreshed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-msi-prestige-ps42-business-laptop.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Prestige</a> lineup of business laptops, as well as its next-generation Raider, Stealth and Crosshair gaming models at this year’s CES. The Raider 16 Max HX is a 300w laptop, which the company says its its most powerful gaming model yet. It can supply 175w to its GeForce RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 GPU, while feeding 125w to its Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor at the same time under full-load conditions. To be able to handle that kind of power, MSI equipped it with a new cooling system consisting of three fans, six heat pipes, five exhaust vents and phase-change thermal compound. The Raider 16 Max also has a quick-access bottom panel that gives users an easy way to upgrade their storage and memory. </p><p>Meanwhile, the new Stealth 16 AI+ laptop’s selling point seems to be its portability. It’s just 16.6mm thin, weighs under two kilograms, comes equipped with RTX 50 series GPU and has dual memory and SSD slots. MSI has also introduced the new Crosshair 16 Max HX and Crosshair 16 HX laptops powered by Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs at the event. Buyers can pay extra for an optional QHD+ 165Hz OLED display if they want sharper visuals, as well. </p><p>In addition to its new gaming laptops, MSI has introduced its all-new Prestige 14 and Prestige 16 business laptops at CES. They’re slimmer with a more rounded silhouette compared to their predecessors, and they’re encased in full aluminum. The laptops are powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors and are equipped with an 81Wh battery that can offer over 30 hours of video playback in 1080p. MSI has debuted the new Modern 14S and 16S series powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors for everyday users, as well. Plus, the company has unveiled a Glacier Blue edition of its handheld gaming console, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/msis-new-claw-gaming-handhelds-have-lunar-lake-processors-and-nondescript-ai-powers-230028563.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Claw</a> 8AI+, that’s powered by the Intel Core Ultra 200V processor with Arc Xe2 graphics. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year HP is making an important change by taking its name off its gaming hardware entirely and letting its HyperX branding take center stage. At CES 2026, the company is celebrating this transition in a big way with Omen Max 16, which is being heralded as the world’s most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling.</p><p>Now the last part of that claim is a bit of a cop out, but considering that most gamers probably don’t want to lug around a notebook with hoses coming out the back, it’s an understandable qualifier. Plus, with a total platform power of 300 watts that includes support for the latest chips from Intel and AMD and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, this thing certainly won’t be lacking in speed. Under the hood, the Max 16 features a third cooling fan to prevent throttling under sustained workloads along with HP’s Fan Cleaner tech that reverses the direction of the laptop’s fans to prevent dust from building up inside.&nbsp;</p><p>As for its design, the Max 16 doesn’t stray too far from HyperX’s signature matte black color scheme, though I do appreciate that the company kept a handful of accents  like the RGB lightbar mounted on the laptop’s front lip. The notebook also features a per-key RGB backlit keyboard with a 1,000Hz polling rate, which should all but eliminate any issues with ghosting or rollover during hectic facerolling sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one quirk about the system I noticed when checking it out first hand is that even with above average brightness of 500 nits for its 2.5K OLED display, the screen also comes with an unusually glossy coating. The benefit of this is that colors appear super saturated. The downside is that especially in well-lit rooms with a lot of sunlight, there’s more glare and reflections than you might expect.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="d14e3a31-a7fc-4c97-abc2-119730bc135f"/><p>Another nice improvement about the Max 16 that might go unnoticed if you only look at its spec sheet is that despite having a TPP of 300 watts, its power brick is relatively compact. It wasn’t all that long ago that a laptop with this kind of performance might have required dual power cables in order to supply the notebook with the amount of juice it needs. That said, weighing between 6.1 and 6.5 pounds depending on the exact configuration, the Max 16 still isn’t the kind of laptop you’re going to want to carry around on a frequent basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, if you’re in the market for what is essentially an old-school desktop replacement laptop without moving up to even larger 18-inch machines, HyperX’s latest flagship gaming laptop should be a strong contender that won’t be lacking in speed.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Max-16-lid.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Max-16-lid.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="One change for 2026 is that HP is taking its name off of its gaming systems and letting the HyperX brand take center stage.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jensen Huang took to the CES stage on Monday to share the latest from NVIDIA,  and while the presentation was more a refresher of technologies the company has been working on for the past few years, there were a couple of notable announcements. </p><p>NVIDIA announced  Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece of the release is Alpamayo 1 , a 10-billion parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says is capable of approaching driving more like a human being would. The model works by breaking down unexpected driving situations into a smaller set of problems before finding the safest  path forward. At each step of the way, the model can explain its reasoning. </p><p>A sister model named AlpaSim allows developers to do closed-loop training for driving scenarios that are rarely encountered in real life. Huang said the 2025 Mercedes Benz CLA will be the first vehicle to ship with NVIDIA’s entire AV stack, including Alpamayo. &quot;Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,&quot; Huang said. </p><p>Following the Alpamayo announcements,  a pair of BD-1 droids from <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </em>joined Huang on stage. We saw one join the executive at last year’s CES. After that, Huang turned to Vera Rubin. NVIDIA <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_(microarchitecture)" data-i13n="slk:first announced the GPU architecture in 2024;cpos:1;pos:1">first announced the GPU architecture in 2024</a>, and now the company has begun production on a super computer that makes use of the new tech. One Vera CPU has 88 custom Olympus cores and 1.5TB of system memory for a total of 227 billion transistors. Meanwhile, one Rubin GPU features 336 billion transistors. Each Vera Rubin supercomputer has a pair of both components.   </p><p>For those hoping for some gaming-related announcements, Huang didn’t have anything to say about NVIDIA’s consumer GPUs, but we may get something later during CES. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When I first heard whispers about the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-shape-whats-next-mobile-innovation/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, I immediately felt conflicted. On one hand it felt like the natural evolution of bi-fold phones like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Z Fold 7</a>. But on the other, all this fancy tech comes with an even higher price — around $2,500 based on current conversion rates from Korean won — not to mention the added bulk you get from a third folding panel. So even as someone who has used a foldable as my daily driver for almost a decade straight, it felt like Samsung’s latest high-end phone was going backwards in terms of both portability and affordability. But then at CES 2026, I got a chance to go hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold and all of my concerns pretty much instantly disappeared because with this thing, flexing is believing.</p><p>My initial consternation comes in large part from using the Z Fold 7, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/foldable-phone-makers-have-solved-every-issue-except-one-130000891.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">hit a major milestone this year thanks</a> to a revamped design that doesn’t come with any added size or weight even when compared to comparable candybar-style phones like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-too-much-ai-not-enough-ultra-140022798.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. That’s a major breakthrough considering how hefty and chunky the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-14-samsung-galaxy-fold-redesign-review-durability-screen.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">original Galaxy Fold</a> was back in 2019. And when you compare the Z Fold 7’s dimensions (7.58 ounces and 8.9mm thick when folded) to the new TriFold (10.9 ounces and 12.9mm when folded), there’s no doubt that Samsung’s new flagship foldable comes with a lot of extra bulk. To put things into context, we have to go back several generations to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-5-review-five-years-in-samsung-is-treading-water-140002461.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Z Fold 5</a> just to find a comparable phone with similar thickness (13.4mm). And even then, that handset is still significantly lighter than the TriFold at 8.92 ounces.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-thickness.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-thickness.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="There&#39;s simply no denying that the Z TriFold (left) is a much bulkier device than the Z Fold 7 (right). " data-uuid="0436edc2-2210-4ce3-b714-3643112973bc"/><figcaption>There&#39;s simply no denying that the Z TriFold (left) is a much bulkier device than the Z Fold 7 (right). </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>But then I opened it up and my concerns were quickly pushed aside because suddenly you’re greeted with 10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness. As a phone that can pull double duty as a tablet, the jump up from the Z Fold 7’s 8-inch main display cannot be understated. Not only does it make multitasking so much easier, when combined with Samsung’s DeX desktop mode, you basically get a miniature laptop experience from a device that fits in a pocket. Especially if you don’t mind carrying around a travel-friendly mouse and keyboard. Plus, you can connect the TriFold to an external display (either wired or wirelessly) to access even more screen space. Way more than with the Z Fold 7, I can honestly see myself leaving my PC at home and using the TriFold as my primary work device.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important but easily overlooked upgrade on the Galaxy Z Trifold is the 4:3 aspect ratio for its 10-inch main display. Compared to the Z Fold 7 and its almost perfectly square screen, you just get so much extra room on the sides for widescreen movies and shows. I tested this out by watching the trailer for Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Odyssey</em>, and even though that movie uses a super wide aspect ratio due to being filmed entirely on IMAX cameras, the viewing experience was just so much better. Peak watchability is something the regular Z Fold line has sort of left by the wayside as the company moved to larger exterior displays, which resulted in the series’ primary screen becoming more square. The one downside though is that the TriFold may make you more of a resolution snob, as it’s a lot easier to tell the difference between 1080p and 2K or 4K on a larger 10-inch panel.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="8ace2500-60c9-402d-824d-64866eb5f9cd"/><p>The final pillar of the TriFold’s kit is all the engineering that Samsung put into making it easy to open and close. Simply moving from one hinge to two while adding a third folding panel undersells the complexity of its design. Samsung actually uses two different types of magnets that push or pull depending on where they are, which makes accessing the TriFold’s primary display practically just as easy as on the Z Fold 7. That’s no small feat. Opening and shutting this thing is just so satisfying on a tactile level, and that’s before you consider that there’s basically no downgrade in terms of image quality.&nbsp;</p><p>While there’s only one way to unfurl the TriFold, which might seem confusing at first, Samsung addressed that too by throwing up a warning and making the whole phone vibrate if you try to do it wrong. And then there are components like the glass-reinforced carbon panels Samsung uses to add strength and durability to its chassis while keeping it as thin as possible. The one potential concern in the future is that unlike Samsung’s older foldables, there’s not as much room for improvement to shrink its dimensions much further, as the TriFold’s slimness is currently limited by the size of its USB-C jack. So if the next model wants to make big gains there, it may need to go completely portless.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Z-Fold-TriFold-movie-watching.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Z-Fold-TriFold-movie-watching.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Here&#39;s what The Odyssey trailer looks like on the Z TriFold (right) compared to the Z Fold 7 (left).

It&#39;s such a better experience. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>On a certain level, I kind of hate how much I like the Galaxy Z TriFold. I really don’t want to go back to bigger, heavier phones that are even more bulky <em>and</em> expensive than the Z Fold 7. But the appeal is impossible to deny and for people who love a good multitasker, I can easily see how these tradeoffs are worth the upside of Samsung’s latest apex foldable.&nbsp;</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is currently on sale in South Korea, though we’re still waiting for official pricing and availability for the US and North American market.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I met up with a few people from Google at the Encore Villas <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-las-vegas-153146838.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABXCoIiT7WZOIxDxH-DQgZmdjVANBM7hcMi5214CK4PHcMhkCfyyZDDW-fRTcWmBUhG7IsyyYJl9WYSGZD1njXMVci3tfqkCLz_TkMtBbpUeoQDLlpOYG9uhyppHOlYl2HDsUZvl884yE2-pBFdXHM7cPSjLNFgAVP-bu9R4kdTj" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">during CES</a> (which is just 2,500 feet from my hotel but took 28 minutes to walk to, thanks to Vegas’s pedestrian-averse design [also I got lost]). Once there, I saw what “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">more Gemini</a>” will mean for people with a Google TV. </p><p>The AI integration ranged from useful to probably unnecessary. The most useful bit, for me at least, came at the end. It’s admittedly a boring, but now you an adjust your TV’s settings just by talking. In the demo, Salahuddin Choudhary, Google’s Gemini for Android product lead said, “Can you boost the dialogue?” and Gemini changed the mode accordingly, without leaving the golf game he was watching. I asked if it could turn off motion smoothing, the first thing I adjust on a new TV (and sometimes other people’s). Yes, it can. </p><p>The “deep dive” Gemini feature could prove fairly useful, too. With it, asking for general information turns into a mini lesson on the subject, complete with generated images and narration. When Choudhary asked Gemini to “explain the Northern Lights to [his] eighth grader,” the screen filled with the standard Gemini answer: a brief definition and images and video tiles for further exploration. But a small Dive deeper button on the screen led to a narrated and illustrated tour of the science behind the phenomenon. My kid is at the age where he asks me questions I can’t answer about the fundamental makeup of the universe — maybe this could help.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google_tv_northern_lights_lesson.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google_tv_northern_lights_lesson.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The Google TV demo at CES showed an answer on the science behind how the northern lights are created " data-uuid="ad793028-3ace-46ef-be97-c1a70672c0fb"/><figcaption>The Google TV demo at CES showed an answer on the science behind how the northern lights are created </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Google Photos is getting a much deeper integration with Google TVs, too. Choudhary asked for pics from a trip to the beach and snapshots of happy people amongst the sea and sand popped up on the screen. One particular shot would make a nice screen saver, I was told, and he asked Gemini to give the photo an oil painting makeover using the Remix feature. </p><p>However, if you want your photo recast in a way not offered with Remix, you can use Nano Banana. Choudhary turned one of the personal photos into a cartoon just by asking. Using Veo turned the same image into an short (if slightly glitchy) animation of a person playing fetch with the dog in the photo.  </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Google_tv_demo_with_neo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Google_tv_demo_with_neo.jpg" style="height:1490px;width:2650px;" alt="Google TV used Neo to recast a picture as a cartoon." data-uuid="9082057f-3eda-4415-bc83-d1539b2b12c9"/><figcaption>Google TV used Neo to recast a picture as a cartoon.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Your ability to generate video will depend on your Gemini subscription tier, but I was told a purchase of a Google TV device would include most of the other AI capabilities that I saw demonstrated. </p><p>I’d classify the photo manipulation and video generation as decidedly less useful that the other features, but my kid would probably get a kick out of messing with them for a while. For people who use Gemini a lot, being able to do so on the biggest screen in the house may appeal. Ditto for those who like seeing your Google Photos in a giant format. Some folks will appreciate the AI image manipulation and generation, I’m sure, but I’m mostly excited about the admittedly boring part of not having to leave a show to boost the brightness of a scene. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tvs-new-gemini-features-range-from-useful-to-unnecessary-222900001.html?src=rss]]></description>
