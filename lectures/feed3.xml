                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a> is useful in several ways — a good one can stream foreign TV shows and events, save you from giving up information to hackers and keep you anonymous to protect against online tracking. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. VPN pricing can be opaque, and providers don't always portray their best deals accurately.</p>
<p>Even so, there are genuinely great bargains on the table. VPN providers give out deep discounts to customers who sign up for a year or more at a time. This lets them boost their subscriber numbers, but it's a win for you as well — while you pay out more upfront, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection.

Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

The nation&#39;s law, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/australia-is-one-step-away-from-banning-social-media-for-under-16s-160454882.html" data-i13n="slk:blocks children under 16 from major social media sites;cpos:2;pos:1">blocks children under 16 from major social media sites</a>, is scheduled to go into effect on December 10.</p><p>Alongside Reddit, Wells said Australian streaming site Kick would also be included. They join the previously announced Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Australia considers the list to be a starting point for the ban and won&#39;t rule out adding more. </p><p>YouTube was initially excluded because it was considered an educational tool. But after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-tiktok-argue-youtube-should-be-included-in-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-160220248.html" data-i13n="slk:protests from other companies;cpos:3;pos:1">protests from other companies</a> on the list, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-tiktok-argue-youtube-should-be-included-in-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-160220248.html" data-i13n="slk:Australia ultimately added it;cpos:4;pos:1">Australia ultimately added it</a>.</p><p>The ban passed in late 2024. The legislation puts the onus on the platforms, rather than parents, to police underage use. Companies that don&#39;t take reasonable steps to prevent under-16 users from accessing their platforms can face penalties of up to AU$49.5 million (around $32 million).</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s a time and place for social media in Australia, but there&#39;s not a place for predatory algorithms, harmful content and toxic popularity [meters] manipulating Australian children,&quot; Wells said. &quot;Online platforms can target children with chilling control. We are mandating they use that sophisticated technology to protect them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update, November 5 2025, 1:09PM ET:</strong> A previous version of this story indicated that Australia was considering banning under 16s from using Discord, GitHub and Roblox. This is not the case, as Australian officials <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/which-platforms-are-age-restricted" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">do not plan to treat those</a> as age-restricted social media platforms.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discord has been trying to strike a balance between affording teen users their privacy and allowing for parental oversight. Over the next week, the platform is rolling out some updates for its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-family-center-tool-gives-parents-better-insight-into-their-teens-discord-usage-150014579.html" data-i13n="slk:Family Center;cpos:1;pos:1">Family Center</a> with the aim of helping parents gain more understanding of what their teens are doing on Discord, while giving them the ability to manage certain settings.&nbsp;</p><p>Parents and guardians were already able to see an overview of some of their teens&#39; Discord activity. Now, they&#39;ll be able to view all purchases for the previous seven days; exactly how long teens have spent in voice and video calls across direct messages, servers and group DMs; and the five users and servers that a teen has called and messaged most often over the last week.</p><p>Teens will have the option to notify a guardian when they report another user or a piece of content to Discord. The guardian will receive an email telling them that their teen filed a report but not the details. The idea behind that is to have a conversation about the report and for the guardian to lend their support.</p><p>In addition, Discord is adding guardian-managed settings to Family Center. These include the ability to determine who can DM a teen and if sensitive content filters are enabled. Guardians will have access to some data privacy controls too.</p><p>Discord said it designed the updates with teens in mind and to make sure they can maintain their independence while having the parental support they might need. Guardians can&#39;t see the content of messages that their teens send. Teens can also view the same information as their guardians in Family Center.&nbsp;</p><p>To use Family Center, guardians and teens need to link their accounts. They can do so by going to <strong>User Settings &gt; Family Center </strong>in the Discord app.</p><p>As with other social platforms, Discord is under the spotlight when it comes to the safety of young users. Earlier this year, New Jersey&#39;s attorney general <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/new-jersey-ag-sues-discord-over-alleged-child-safety-failures-184501604.html" data-i13n="slk:sued Discord;cpos:2;pos:1">sued Discord</a>, claiming that it &quot;misled parents about the efficacy of its safety controls and obscured the risks children faced when using the application.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update, November 5, 2025, 1:01PM ET:</strong> A previous version of this story indicated that Australia was considering banning under 16s from using Discord. This is not the case, as Discord <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/which-platforms-are-age-restricted" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">will not be considered</a> an age-restricted social media platform by Australian officials.

To remedy that, Atari and developer Digital Eclipse are releasing another paid expansion for the retro collection.

<p>To rewind, Meta revamped its teen-specific accounts — which were first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-teen-accounts-with-parental-controls-will-be-mandatory-for-kids-under-16-120013852.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> last year — last month, claiming that going forward the account content would be guided by PG-13 movie ratings. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/instagram-teen-accounts-pg-13-ratings/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> explaining the change, it said: &quot;Just like you might see some suggestive content or hear some strong language in a PG-13 movie, teens may occasionally see something like that on Instagram — but we’re going to keep doing all we can to keep those instances as rare as possible.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Engadget’s Karissa Bell <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-makes-teen-accounts-more-restrictive-120000653.html"><ins>pointed out</ins></a> at the time, while Meta openly acknowledged that no system is without its flaws, the analogy is a bit vague and confusing, especially as the company has tightened up some of its rules so that teens are no longer supposed to see any &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; content on the app. This is despite content of that nature often being present in a PG-13 movie.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Teenage Engineering <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://teenage.engineering/products/ep-40"><ins>just revealed the EP-40 Riddim sampler</ins></a>. This reggae-inspired groovebox is another redesign of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineerings-ko-ii-groovebox-is-feature-rich-and-only-300-164933466.html"><ins>pre-existing EP-133 KO II sampler</ins></a>. It has the same square body and button-based workflow, but there are several changes here.</p>
<p>First of all, the entire exterior has been redesigned to make that reggae theme really pop. It&#39;s green and off-white, with fun fonts aplenty. The thing just screams &quot;play me,&quot; much like the original KO II.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e9314f9c00f547fd913a29650680c7e9"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IV6G0I_VBCk?si=K4nmFOu8UZhn9xwQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest internal feature is the addition of an actual synth engine called Supertone. The previous models in this series were just samplers. The company promises that this engine can deliver thick bass sounds and classic leads. It also offers access to a dub-inspired siren mode that&#39;s pressure sensitive. It oscillates faster the harder you press it.</p>
<p>The machine also boasts double the storage and an additional main effect. All told, there are seven main effects and 12 punch-in effects. These have all been inspired by reggae tunes. It comes pre-loaded with hundreds of samples which have also primarily been pulled from the genre.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just for reggae, as sounds are sounds and people can do whatever they want with them. Also, it&#39;s really easy to load your own samples into this machine via a web tool. I&#39;ve used the tool often with the original KO II and it truly is drag-and-drop.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one final fascinating element here. The sampler ships with something called the EP-2350 Ting microphone. This handheld mic resembles something out of a CB radio and is &quot;lo-fi by design.&quot; It features four voice-changing effects, including one that combines echo and spring reverb. This is an essential effect for dub reggae vocals. In theory, this microphone could be used with other devices, but it&#39;s only available as a combo pack with the Riddim.</p>
<p>Everything else is in line with the KO II. It has a speaker that&#39;ll likely be pretty crappy, but also plenty of inputs and outputs. It operates via AA batteries and there are 12 buttons to trigger samples.</p>
<p>The Riddim is slightly more expensive than its counterparts, at $329. However, this does include the aforementioned Ting microphone. It&#39;s available right now for purchase.</p>

<p>It doesn't look like Disney-owned channels including ABC and ESPN will be returning to YouTube TV anytime soon. The Walt Disney Co. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html">pulled its channels from YouTube TV</a> as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement and the spat is showing no signs of a resolution yet. While big sporting events are often where the rubber meets the road on these channel blackouts, YouTube TV subscribers were unable to see any college football games on ABC or ESPN all weekend, and a number of tonight's NBA games are going to be affected, too. YouTube TV management <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-response-to-disneys-request-to-restore-abc/">officially rebuffed Disney's request</a> for a 24-hour restoration of its channels in a blog post on Monday — ostensibly to offer coverage of Tuesday's elections — proposing instead that Disney reactivate the feeds for ABC and ESPN while negotiations continue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>YouTube TV had previously stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. (Some users<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/streaming/articles/youtube-tv-users-10-credit-175300340.html"> have reportedly noticed an option for $10 off </a>in their accounts.) This discount provides little consolation though if you want to watch tonight's NBA games or your favorite shows like <em>Abbott Elementary</em>, <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> and <em>Dancing with the Stars.</em> If you don't want to miss out on tonight's <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/minnesota-timberwolves-new-york-knicks-2025110518/">Minnesota Timberwolves vs. New York Knicks</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/san-antonio-spurs-los-angeles-lakers-2025110513/">San Antonio Spurs vs. Los Angeles Lakers</a> games — both on ESPN — you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>One of the cheapest ways to watch ESPN is with a Sling Day Pass — for just $5/day, you can tune into any and all ESPN programming, including tonight's NBA games, with no other commitments. If you want a full switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all the Disney-owned channels. (Remember, unlike a lot of cable plans, you can easily <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-or-pause-your-youtube-tv-subscription-192023656.html">pause or cancel YouTube TV</a> or any of these alternatives, so long as you have month-to-month subscriptions.)

(If you're just looking to catch one of this week's big games, like <em>Monday Night Football</em> on ESPN, it's a great short-term solution.) If you want a longer-term solution, you can get both ESPN and ABC with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge.&nbsp;</p>

Best Buy&#39;s early Black Friday sale has the comfy cans for 45 percent off, knocking their price down to $199. That matches <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-bose-quietcomfort-headphones-are-still-on-sale-for-199-on-the-last-day-of-prime-day-103010111.html">their record low from Prime Day</a>.</p> 
<p>Bose&#39;s headphones have top-notch comfort and active noise cancellation (ANC). For the latter, you can choose between &quot;Quiet&quot; (full ANC) and &quot;Aware&quot; (hear your surroundings) modes. There&#39;s also a wind-blocking feature. The headphones&#39; audio, while not quite on par with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review-impactful-upgrades-to-a-familiar-formula-150000709.html">the $449 Ultra variant</a> (and missing spatial tricks), far surpasses what you&#39;ll typically find for $199.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The company estimates 24 hours of battery life. It also supports quick charging: Plug in its USB-C cable and get up to 2.5 hours of charge in only 15 minutes.</p> 
<p>This model doesn&#39;t include an option to turn off ANC altogether, which some people may have appreciated. (That would have led to even more battery life, desirable for frequent travelers.)

In the US, the company has begun rolling out an update for Chrome on Android and iOS that adds an AI Mode shortcut to the browser&#39;s new tab page. It&#39;s predominantly featured, appearing right below the browser&#39;s signature search bar.</p>
<p>&quot;This will let you ask more complex, multi-part questions, and then dive even deeper into a topic with follow-up questions and relevant links,&quot; the company said of the update. In the near future, Google plans to bring the shortcut to 160 additional countries, with support for other languages — including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese — on the way as well.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bang &amp; Olufsen just announced a new luxury speaker that costs a pretty penny. The Beosound Premiere is a soundbar made from aluminum that&#39;s priced at $5,800.</p>
<p>It&#39;s visually striking, with the company referring to the soundbar as a &quot;piece of art.&quot; The aluminum chassis looks to be seamless, with a gorgeous matte satin finish. The up-firing tweeter has been placed directly in the center to draw the eye and there are plenty of lights placed throughout. There are lots of little details here, including 1,925 bespoke perforations to pay tribute to the company&#39;s founding year.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This is not merely a product; it is a curated experience,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Beosound Premiere redefines the category.&quot;</p>
<div id="602ceed1947045539edd8a6690d20f13"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWRyizoe3sk?si=gYF5QVQosNVCzNMS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>As for sound, there are ten custom-engineered drivers that assist with spatial audio by firing upwards. This allows &quot;sound to unfold around the listener from all angles&quot; and &quot;enhances clarity in dialogue and delivers deep, powerful bass.&quot; It integrates with Dolby Atmos 7.1.4 and can be paired with additional Bang &amp; Olufsen speakers via the company&#39;s proprietary Beolink Surround technology.</p>
<p>The soundbar also features a new patent-pending technology called Wide Stage. This uses a custom-designed algorithm to create the illusion of having additional speakers, making the &quot;soundstage wider and taller than it is.&quot; All of this stuff combines for an immersive listening experience.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also some kind of special integration with LG OLED C and G series TVs, but the company didn&#39;t get into what that entails. We reached out to Bang &amp; Olufsen for clarification. It&#39;s worth noting that the soundbar can work with any TV or audio source.</p>

<p>The Beosound Premiere is available in a trio of colorways, with the natural aluminum model releasing first in December. The gold one comes out in February, followed by a black soundbar in March. All models ship with a stand that enables both wall-mounting and tabletop placement. Again, the Premiere costs $5,800.</p>
<p>That high-end sticker price has become a hallmark of Bang &amp; Olufsen.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it was <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-playstation-portal-remote-player-is-a-200-handheld-just-for-ps5-game-streaming-140704336.html">first announced</a>, the PlayStation Portal was sort of a joke. The Nintendo Switch was a megahit, and many PlayStation fans had long hoped Sony would respond with a new handheld of its own. It did… in the form of a $200 peripheral that can only stream games over the internet and required you to already own a PlayStation 5. Instead of a successor to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-vita-10th-anniversary-favorite-games-200013083.html">beloved</a> yet <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vita-sony-editorial-rip-140000761.html">famously neglected</a> PlayStation Vita, we got the PlayStation version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-26-the-wii-u-revisited-looking-back-on-a-forward-thinking-console.html">Wii U GamePad</a>.</p> 
<p>My colleague Devindra Hardawar called it “baffling” in our <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-portal-review-a-baffling-handheld-for-no-one-but-sony-diehards-201558485.html">PlayStation Portal review</a>, and many of his criticisms still stand two years later. I was happy to ignore the Portal as a result. Besides, I already owned a bunch of devices that covered every way I wanted to play. The PS5 and PC were for the “pretty” games I want to sit and revel in on my monitor, while the Switch and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">Steam Deck</a> were for playing away from my desk. This combination worked for me.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Then, a few months ago, my wife and I had our first child. She is wonderful, and we are happy. But life pre-kids is often incongruous with life post-kids. My old routines and any pretense of personal time are gone. And while this might be the single least important aspect of my life that’s changed since becoming a father, the whiplash of going from “mid-30s man who spends too much time thinking about video games” to “mid-30s man who <em>wants</em> to enjoy his hobby but is now responsible for raising a kid” has completely turned me around on the Portal, which my wife gifted to me a few months prior to our baby’s birth.</p> 
<p>To be clear, I’m not here jonesing to play games all day instead of bonding with my daughter. But every parent needs a break sometimes, and whatever “free” time I get these days is inherently staggered. It’s not just the usual changing, feeding, tummy-time monitoring and diaper pail maintenance; it’s the 20-30 minutes of prep and clean-up that often comes with each of those.

<p>All of this has been much more fun than it sounds, but for gaming purposes, it means I’ve almost exclusively switched to things I can play in short bursts. It’s been a lot of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html"><em>Balatro</em></a>, a lot of clearly timed multiplayer games like <em>Rocket League</em>, plus some slower, single-player games that let you save and quit at any time. These kinds of games have always been best suited to handhelds, and are thus the ones the Portal has helped me enjoy again when we get the baby to bed.</p> 
<p>Yes, I could just use the Switch or Steam Deck. But I dropped $500 on this damn PS5 back in 2020. I have more games in my PlayStation library than any other platform. I want to (slowly) make my way through exclusives like <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. I don’t want my fancy console to collect dust, and as silly as it sounds, finding the energy to sit at my desk and give my full attention to a game is difficult after a day of work and parenting. Most nights I’d prefer to unspool on the couch with my wife, and I need to be nearby to lend a hand or change a diaper. The Portal has allowed me to do this, and it’s kept my PlayStation from turning into a funky-looking paperweight in the process.</p> 
<p>The Portal fills this niche mostly by just being a handheld device, but it has its own benefits. The controls are fantastic, essentially splitting a normal PS5 controller in half. They give everything an “official” feel that you just can’t replicate with a smartphone controller <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/backbone-pro-hands-on-a-pricey-controller-for-more-than-just-your-phone-130034399.html">like a Backbone</a>. I wish the 8-inch display had a more color-rich OLED panel, but it’s still good for an LCD, roomier than my phone’s screen and sharp enough at 1080p. I’m a <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-ergofit-earbuds-irl-153513919.html">wired headphone guy</a>, so I can live with its lack of Bluetooth audio, as asinine as that is. And while I’m no longer paying $160 per year for PlayStation Plus Premium, those that do <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-stream-ps5-games-you-own-over-the-cloud-on-the-playstation-portal-135025829.html">can now stream</a> certain games <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-cloud-streaming-makes-the-playstation-portal-far-more-useful-171038751.html">directly from the cloud</a> without having to boot up their console. That worked fine in the short time I tried it.</p>

<p>My experience with the Portal is entirely predicated on the fact that I live in a modest apartment with decent Wi-Fi. It’s still a streaming device, so there’ve been some hiccups here and there. Using it for shooters or fighting games<em>&nbsp;</em>is just asking for frustration, and things start to destabilize if we have several streams going in the house at once. But under normal conditions, I’ve been able to play competitive multiplayer games like <em>Rematch </em>without ruinous lag, and I just haven’t had the crushing connection issues some folks have suffered through with single-player fare. As long as I keep the PS5 in rest mode, everything turns on and eventually works as it should.</p> 
<p>It’s a weird one: I still wouldn’t recommend the Portal to most PS5 owners, nor would I change all that much about our initial review. Of course, receiving it as a gift skews my perspective. Yet it’s made it easier to fit some games into my new life all the same. Looking after an infant has been one of my greatest joys, but it’s undeniably exhausting. With the Portal, I can still enjoy a platform I’ve heavily invested in — provided I don’t pass out first.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-playstation-portal-is-still-flawed-but-ive-learned-to-love-it-as-a-new-dad-120000850.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony AI released a dataset that tests the fairness and bias of AI models. It&#39;s called the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced like &quot;Phoebe&quot;). The company describes it as the &quot;first publicly available, globally diverse, consent-based human image dataset for evaluating bias across a wide variety of computer vision tasks.&quot; In other words, it tests the degree to which today&#39;s AI models treat people fairly. Spoiler: Sony didn&#39;t find a single dataset from any company that fully met its benchmarks.</p>
<p>Sony says FHIBE can address the AI industry&#39;s ethical and bias challenges. The dataset includes images of nearly 2,000 volunteers from over 80 countries. All of their likenesses were shared with consent — something that can&#39;t be said for the common practice of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-investigating-perplexity-ai-after-accusations-it-scrapes-websites-without-consent-133003374.html">scraping large volumes of web data</a>. Participants in FHIBE can remove their images at any time. Their photos include annotations noting demographic and physical characteristics, environmental factors and even camera settings.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tool &quot;affirmed previously documented biases&quot; in today&#39;s AI models. But Sony says FHIBE can also provide granular diagnoses of factors that led to those biases. One example: Some models had lower accuracy for people using &quot;she/her/hers&quot; pronouns, and FHIBE highlighted greater hairstyle variability as a previously overlooked factor.</p>
<p>FHIBE also determined that today&#39;s AI models reinforced stereotypes when prompted with neutral questions about a subject&#39;s occupation. The tested models were particularly skewed &quot;against specific pronoun and ancestry groups,&quot; describing subjects as sex workers, drug dealers or thieves. And when prompted about what crimes an individual committed, models sometimes produced &quot;toxic responses at higher rates for individuals of African or Asian ancestry, those with darker skin tones and those identifying as &#39;he/him/his.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Sony AI says FHIBE proves that ethical, diverse and fair data collection is possible. The tool is now <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fairnessbenchmark.ai.sony">available to the public</a>, and it will be updated over time. A paper outlining the research was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09716-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em> on Wednesday.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/sony-has-a-new-benchmark-for-ethical-ai-160045574.html?src=rss]]></description>

If Amazon’s<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.numerator.com/prime-big-deal-days/"> Prime Big Deal Days was any indicator</a>, folks are spending more on essentials than anything else during these big sales.

Personally, I&#39;m not eyeing a new smartphone or laptop this holiday shopping season, but there are a few tech purchases I’d like to make if the prices are right. This is the tech I’m hoping to save on this year during Black Friday.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-the-best-early-tech-deals-on-apple-shark-lego-and-other-gear-ahead-of-the-biggest-sale-of-the-year-100052620.html?src=rss]]></description>

It can notify you when items on your wishlist go on sale too. If you go to a physical Nintendo store or event, you can use the app to check in and receive rewards.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s another intriguing feature here: a way to view your play time for any game across Nintendo’s last few consoles, including the 3DS and Wii U. You’ll have to link your Nintendo Network ID to your Nintendo Account to see your Wii U and 3DS data, but play activity on those systems after February 2020 isn’t factored in.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-official-nintendo-store-app-hits-ios-and-android-151733629.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/proton-vpn-black-friday-deal-two-year-plans-are-75-percent-off-right-now-153737976.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the American market <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html" data-i13n="slk:still struggling;cpos:1;pos:1">still struggling</a> to get its head around the whole electric car thing, plenty of manufacturers are scaling back their EV ambitions to refocus on hybrid power. Whether that&#39;s right for the market and, indeed, the globe remains to be seen, but we can for sure expect to see a lot more cars with internal combustion over the next few years.</p><p>Honda has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-none-are-us-bound-150000629.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">made its plans clear</a> on that front, which might be cause for concern among many for one simple reason: Outside of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-23-2019-acura-nsx-review.html" data-i13n="slk:NSX;cpos:3;pos:1">NSX</a>, the company&#39;s hybrids thus far haven&#39;t exactly been the most engaging of machines. That, though, could change with a new set of hybrid platforms launching soon that&#39;ll be lighter, quicker and even more fun to drive.</p><p>At the company&#39;s extensive proving grounds outside of Tochigi, Japan, I was given a go in a pair of cars that gave me reason to be optimistic about this next generation of electrically assisted but still combustion-dependent machines. They rely on a series of advancements that come together to form three different platforms: Small, Medium and Large.</p><p>Collectively, they&#39;re known as the Next Generation Hybrid System, and each one is designed to be modular, able to be scaled up or down to fit different models while still keeping their fundamental sections the same. Platform sharing like this makes it much easier (and cheaper) for manufacturers to roll out new machines and to do it quickly. With Honda looking to ramp up its hybrid offerings, that&#39;s key.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%285%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%285%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The the engine for Honda&#39;s &quot;Large&quot; next-gen hybrid system " data-uuid="69c6a27e-c77e-41ef-a10b-3e34554267f8"><figcaption>The the engine for Honda&#39;s &quot;Large&quot; next-gen hybrid system </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>These platforms encompass things like chassis, engines, electric motors and electronics, plus the wonderful web of software required to tie it all together. Reducing weight is a huge focus here, with Honda&#39;s engineers coming up with a way to maintain crash safety while dramatically reducing the size of the front and rear subframes. This alone equates to a weight savings of some 90 kilograms (about 200 pounds) in a vehicle the size of a Honda Civic.&nbsp;</p><p>Lighter weight means more efficiency and better fuel economy. There&#39;s also a commensurate reduction in cost of 10 percent for manufacturing versus the company&#39;s current platforms, plus promises of increased grip and reduced road noise.&nbsp;</p><p>The smallest of Honda&#39;s new platforms is destined for Honda&#39;s smallest cars, including ultra-minis that swarm Japanese streets but have rarely found much success in the United States. For now, at least, we won&#39;t be getting any cars based on that platform.</p><p>The Medium and Large platforms, though, will be tucked in neatly throughout many next-generation cars from the brand. Medium will be suitable for four-cylinder machines like the Civic and crossover SUVs like the HR-V. The Large platform, meanwhile, will be used for bigger V6 machines, like the Ridgeline and Passport.</p><p>Each system ties that engine to a pair of electric motors, plus an optional third electric motor at the back for all-wheel drive. A revised, more compact battery provides the high-voltage current to power the system. It&#39;s tucked in beneath the rear seat.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%2811%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%2811%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="A next-gen prototype on track at Honda&#39;s facility near Tochigi, Japan" data-uuid="bd216f5d-3ebe-45fb-b671-05b55ad2906f"><figcaption>A next-gen prototype on track at Honda&#39;s facility near Tochigi, Japan</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>None of that is radically different from what can be found in Honda&#39;s current hybrids. And, like those, these new hybrids will be able to run in an effective series hybrid mode, where the engine just charges the battery and the car drives exclusively using the electric motors. Or, step on that throttle harder at higher speeds and the car can directly engage the engine to power the car forward.</p><p>That&#39;s all familiar, but a few changes could have some significant impacts. On the Large platform, a new transmission enables the car to have both a &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;lo&quot; gear range, which could be a boon for anyone towing their trusty trailer up into the mountains for a weekend getaway.&nbsp;</p><p>The Medium-sized platform can do some shifting, too, but it&#39;s only pretend shifting here using a system called S+ Shift. At the press of a button (conveniently labeled S+), this new technology creates the experience of driving a virtual eight-speed transmission that you can run up or down through by pulling on the shift paddles on the back of the steering wheel.</p><p>Since, again, these hybrids are driven by their electric motors, shifting isn&#39;t really doing much of anything but making the engine rev more or less. But, by varying the electric motor&#39;s output and regeneration, you get a surge of extra resistance on deceleration and a kick of acceleration on upshifts, all to simulate the feeling of a proper transmission.</p><p>I confess that I was very skeptical about how this system would really help when I went to Japan, but I was wrong. It&#39;s great. Honda prepared a prototype sedan for me to drive, and it looked all the world like a current-gen Civic up top, except with a rather large nose stuck on the front and some decidedly pronounced flared fenders.&nbsp;</p><p>Underneath the skin was a completely different machine, built around a front-drive version of the next-gen platform. It sounded great to start, helped by what looked like a sport exhaust at the back, plus no shortage of digital augmentation coming through the speakers.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Prelude_first_drive_012.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Prelude_first_drive_012.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The S+ button on Honda&#39;s upcoming Prelude hybrid" data-uuid="89fe89b3-ac75-49f1-92e6-6ace117df1ac"><figcaption>The S+ button on Honda&#39;s upcoming Prelude hybrid</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>But the S+ Shift mode really made a compelling difference, too. Even though you&#39;re really just needlessly revving that hybrid engine more or less, and actually making the system less efficient, the result is a car that feels responsive and in control, rather than something just droning on as deftly as possible.The way the car responds, aggressively downshifting as you brake for corners and giving you a little kick with every upshift on the way out, it made me smile.</p><p>The rest of the car did, too. Honda&#39;s test track was far too smooth for me to sample the improved ride quality or reduction in road noise, but the car&#39;s handling felt good and its steering sharp, not quite as remarkable as the current Civic Type R but, again, way more fun than today&#39;s humble Civic Hybrid.&nbsp;</p><p>Honda hasn&#39;t announced where this new platform will first appear, but if you want to get an early taste of S+ Shift, it&#39;ll be debuting in the upcoming Honda Prelude hybrid. That reborn coupe lacks all the other advancements to be found in Honda&#39;s next-gen platform, but it does offer the S+ virtual shifting. It&#39;s remarkably effective here, too, and with lots of parts sharing with the Civic Type R, the Prelude was a surprisingly good time.</p><p>While the Prelude is hitting dealers soon, to sample cars featuring the next-gen hybrid platform, you&#39;ll have to wait a little longer. Honda representatives said it&#39;ll start showing up beneath the flesh of its machines starting as soon as next year. Based on the shape of that prototype I drove, I&#39;d say a next-generation Civic will be among the first to sport it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/driving-hondas-lighter-faster-and-more-fun-next-gen-hybrid-prototype-150000472.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every two years, the Japan Mobility Show gives us a preview of the future of motoring as envisioned by the major Japanese manufacturers. Sadly, for Honda, the resounding message coming from this year&#39;s show was that the future is getting a little farther away. That&#39;s the case for American drivers, at least, thanks largely to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html" data-i13n="slk:the effects of the Trump administration;cpos:1;pos:1">the effects of the Trump administration</a> according to Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe.&nbsp;</p><p>In Tokyo this year, the company unveiled a trio of cool, next-gen electric vehicles at the show, each more compelling than the next. First up is the new 0 Series α, a new addition to the 0 Series of EVs that Honda has been teasing us with for a few years now.</p><p>Back in January at&nbsp; CES, the company showed off the evocatively styled <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-closer-look-at-the-slick-honda-0-suv-and-saloon-prototypes-at-ces-2025-134550129.html" data-i13n="slk:0 Saloon and 0 SUV;cpos:2;pos:1">0 Saloon and 0 SUV</a>. Both made quite a stir, particularly the former, which was impossible to admire without picking up strong Lamborghini vibes. Mibe confirmed that those cars are still on track, coming towards the end of 2026 or 2027. However, expected sales have been reduced.&nbsp;</p><p>Mibe didn&#39;t give specifics there, only saying: &quot;The volume initially will probably be less than we had envisioned earlier.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_0_series_alpha_%282%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_0_series_alpha_%282%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Honda 0 Series &#x0003b1; EV looks similar to the SUV prototype from CES 2025" data-uuid="29a734ec-08a2-46a3-9b35-20df88a6f060"><figcaption>Honda 0 Series α EV looks similar to the SUV prototype from CES 2025</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honda</div></figure><p>The newly unveiled 0 Series α is a new, third member of Honda&#39;s nascent next-gen EV family. It looks nigh identical to the SUV concept, but in reality, it&#39;s significantly smaller. It will be cheaper, too, enabling it to target the Indian market. It has a hope of going elsewhere in the world, including Japan and Europe, but Honda representatives said repeatedly that it&#39;s not for the American market. Mibe said it&#39;s &quot;probably too small&quot; for the US market.</p><p>So, too, the Super-One Prototype. This tiny hatchback made a run up the hill at the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this year, wrapped in camouflage to hide its decidedly angular profile. In Tokyo, Honda stripped off the graphics, revealing a cheeky mini-sized machine with big box fenders and endless personality. While Honda didn&#39;t quote a power output, it surely won’t be a rocket ship, but with the instant torque of an EV, plus a variety of selectable synthesized engine notes, it should still be a mighty good time.</p><p>Indeed, it was. I got a brief go behind the wheel of a prototype machine at Honda&#39;s proving grounds in Tochigi, Japan. Though it wasn&#39;t much for outright speed, the brisk acceleration combined with petite dimensions made me grin ear-to-ear. Sadly, though, that&#39;s probably the only chance I&#39;ll ever get to drive one. The Super-One is intended for drivers in Japan and the United Kingdom, with potential expansion elsewhere in Europe based on demand.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%284%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%284%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Driving the Honda Super-One on a test track near Tochigi, Japan" data-uuid="c39ec131-a19c-478a-877e-163b6c319540"><figcaption>Driving the Honda Super-One on a test track near Tochigi, Japan</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>America has never been a great market for machines of that size, so it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that these two aren&#39;t US-bound, but it is part of a more troubling trend. Honda has largely paused its efforts to develop low-cost EVs for the American market, waiting for political headwinds to come around.</p><p>&quot;With the Trump administration in place, we have a sense that maybe the EV growth has been moved back out by maybe five years or so into the future. So, the timing for doing anything will be difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;2030, at that point in time, maybe we need to provide a wide, broad product range, including EVs. So, we will have to think about future strategy for the US market.&quot;</p><p>Tellingly, Mibe said that they&#39;re actively watching American mid-term elections, to see whether there&#39;s any hope of the political climate changing in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like in discount furniture stores, volume is the real factor here, particularly when it comes to battery production. The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-honda-gm-ev.html" data-i13n="slk:partnership with General Motors;cpos:3;pos:1">partnership with General Motors</a> was an attempt to do just that.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%281%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%281%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Honda&#39;s Super-One prototype isn&#39;t much for speed, but that&#39;s okay" data-uuid="f9071d66-9466-4ab5-9bea-1d8d6de20818"><figcaption>Honda&#39;s Super-One prototype isn&#39;t much for speed, but that&#39;s okay</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;Our first objective in collaborating with GM was to expand the volume to reduce the cost,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe the aim there, from on the side of GM, was the same.&quot;</p><p>That partnership, however, was aborted after just the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-prologue-electric-suv-184544002.html" data-i13n="slk:Honda Prologue;cpos:4;pos:1">Honda Prologue</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/acuras-zdx-ev-has-an-estimated-325-miles-of-range-and-starts-at-around-60000-160023372.html" data-i13n="slk:Acura ZDX;cpos:5;pos:1">Acura ZDX</a> reached the market, leaving Honda to go its own way for now, at least, bereft of a partner to boost its battery volume.&nbsp;</p><p>This could complicate Honda&#39;s plans to be totally carbon neutral by 2050, a pledge that Mibe said is still very much in the cards. To start in that direction, the company will push more towards advanced hybrids of the sort we&#39;ll get our first taste of starting next year. (I also got to sample that while I was out there, which you can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/driving-hondas-lighter-faster-and-more-fun-next-gen-hybrid-prototype-150000472.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">read about here</a>.)</p><p>However, while these new hybrids will decrease consumption and further reduce the carbon footprint of a given car, they will not completely eliminate it. So, Honda is working on other means of decreasing the company&#39;s effective carbon footprint, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/can-our-climate-be-saved-by-vacuuming-carbon-out-of-the-skies-145944818.html" data-i13n="slk:direct air capture (DAC);cpos:7;pos:1">direct air capture (DAC)</a>, devices which can suck carbon dioxide straight out of the air — a long-time environmental dream that&#39;s always seemed just a few years away.</p><p>So small, cheap EVs aren&#39;t in the plans for the immediate future, but Honda isn&#39;t totally giving up on its US EV aspirations. Again, the 0 Series SUV and Saloon are due next year. Mibe said there&#39;s another, even larger EV due for the American market sometime after 2030, but that too could depend on which way the American government swings between now and then.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EV_Outlire_Concept_04_ON_v04.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EV_Outlire_Concept_04_ON_v04.jpg" style="height:1911px;width:2560px;" alt="Honda&#39;s EV Outlier is an electric motorcycle concept with sci-fi looks" data-uuid="3f6d943d-02cf-4cb1-b713-4c12da1e0f12"><figcaption>Honda&#39;s EV Outlier is an electric motorcycle concept with sci-fi looks</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honda</div></figure><p>If all&#39;s looking well, we might eventually get a taste of another electric concept that Honda rolled out at the show. Called the EV Outlier, it&#39;s an electric motorcycle with a lean, sharp style and a laid-back riding position that is hard not to read as at least partially inspired by that most iconic sci-fi motorcycle of all time: Kaneda&#39;s bike in Akira.</p><p>This one isn&#39;t red and it lacks the distinctive stickers, but like Kaneda&#39;s bike, both wheels are driven by electricity. It relies on a pair of integrated hub motors to provide the thrust, and if the width of the rear tire is any indication, there&#39;ll be plenty of that.</p><p>A sweeping, free-standing digital display serves as the dashboard, and controls are minimalist in a way that only a concept bike can be. Honda said this might be ready for production by 2030, but the svelte packaging here may necessitate next-generation, solid-state batteries to make that a reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Those batteries, Mibe said, are still progressing. Honda has a prototype production line in process, so they&#39;re actually building the things and trying to turn them into viable products.</p><p>But that&#39;s only if Honda can overcome some significant engineering challenges between now and then, and if the US government dials back on the EV hate by the end of the decade. Those are two pretty big ifs, and I confess I&#39;m not sure which poses the biggest challenge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-its-us-plans-are-getting-more-tepid-150000775.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slowly but surely, Sony has been transforming the initially limited <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-portal-review-a-baffling-handheld-for-no-one-but-sony-diehards-201558485.html">PlayStation Portal</a> into a viable handheld for PS5 gamers, albeit only those with a solid internet connection. What launched as a strictly remote play device eventually got <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-cloud-streaming-makes-the-playstation-portal-far-more-useful-171038751.html">unlocked</a> for cloud streaming, with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/stray-leads-novembers-lineup-of-ps-plus-games-180339318.html">PS Plus</a> Premium members able to play select Game Catalog games without needing to connect to a PS5. And from 6am PT <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">today</a>, you can also stream select digital PS5 games that you own on the Portal.</p>
<p>Again, you’ll need to have a PS Plus Premium membership to take advantage of the new features, but once signed up to the most expensive tier of Sony’s subscription service you’ll be able to stream the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/astro-bot-ps5-review-one-of-the-best-games-sony-has-ever-made-120014494.html"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-a-whole-new-world-140018063.html"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which are among the the thousands of games <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">supported</a> at launch. Naturally some of the games in your library will probably be on PS Plus as cloud-streamable games already, but newer first-party games like several of those mentioned above aren&#39;t.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2dbab47d654d4324a631e67cc8e02a14"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPgBMPkWXeg?si=rliSDs4xfuAMLs8-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>You could, of course, already also play all of these games on the Portal over remote play from your PS5. But now that the device has been untethered from the main console, it gets a little bit closer to the dedicated go-anywhere PlayStation handheld everyone wants. That&#39;s provided you have a decent enough Wi-Fi connection to get a good quality stream.</p>
<p>Alongside the new cloud streaming functionality, the Portal has a new home screen that adds a search tab for quickly finding games that are available to stream. The latest update also adds 3D audio support for supported games on both remote play and cloud streams when using wired headphones or one of Sony’s proprietary PlayStation Link headsets. You can also now add a passcode lock to the device, while a new network status screen is available in the Quick menu.</p>
<p>Sony now allows you to make in-game purchases while streaming games over the cloud without leaving a session, and if you have a friend playing the same game you’re streaming, you can receive invites and join their game from the Quick menu.</p>
<p>Sony seems intent on the PlayStation Portal plugging the gap between now and the PS6, which could <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/leak-claims-the-ps6-could-have-triple-the-performance-as-the-ps5-for-the-same-price-203801615.html">reportedly</a> arrive in the next two years alongside a powerful complementary handheld device that might beat out the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> in the specs department. A next-generation native PlayStation handheld remains the dream, but in the meantime, the Portal is a lot more appealing than it was a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-stream-ps5-games-you-own-over-the-cloud-on-the-playstation-portal-135025829.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-the-official-replacement-for-google-assistant-on-smart-devices-130041482.html">replacing Assistant</a> with Gemini across all its apps, and Maps is the latest one getting an upgrade. The AI assistant will let you interact with the app using natural conversation while you navigate the roads hands-free. You can, for instance, ask it: &quot;Is there a budget-friendly Japanese restaurant along my route within a couple of miles?&quot; And after it has responded, you can keep on asking it follow-up questions, such as if a specific restaurant has a parking space and what dishes are popular there. Once you&#39;ve decided on a place, you can simply tell Gemini: &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go there,&quot; to start navigating to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also be able to ask Gemini to do random tasks while it&#39;s navigating and without leaving the Maps app, such as adding events to your Calendar if you allow it to connect to the app. In addition, Gemini will let you report traffic disruptions, simply by saying &quot;there&#39;s flooding ahead&quot; or &quot;I see an accident.&quot; Gemini in Google Maps is rolling out over the next few weeks to Android and iOS in all regions where Gemini is available. It&#39;s also coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html">Android Auto in the future</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the US, Maps is getting more capabilities powered by the AI assistant. You can now get directions that mention landmarks that are easy to spot. Instead of saying &quot;turn left in 500 feet,&quot; for example, Gemini will say &quot;turn left after the Thai Siam Restaurant.&quot; The landmark will also be highlighted in Maps as a visual cue. This feature is now rolling out to both Android and iOS devices. Maps will now proactively notify you of road disruptions on Android, as well, even if you&#39;re not actively navigating. Finally, you&#39;ll be able to use Lens with Gemini within the Maps app when it starts rolling out later this month to Android and iOS. You simply have to tap on the camera in the Maps search bar, point to an establishment and ask it questions about the location, such as &quot;What is this place and why is it popular?&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-maps-gemini-integration-will-make-hands-free-navigation-more-conversational-140009629.html?src=rss]]></description>

This model is also available in storage sizes of 128GB and 512GB, but at the moment, only the 256GB model has a discount.</p> 
<p>This particular model easily made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

It just gets the job done. We loved the speed on offer here. It was the fastest of all the cards we tested when transferring games and loading games.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark.</p> 
<p>The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn&#39;t just for Nintendo&#39;s latest console. It&#39;ll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2026 is seemingly going to be the year that Netflix gets aggressive with podcasting. We already knew that the streamer will <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/some-spotify-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-180000074.html"><ins>start licensing</ins></a> video podcasts from Spotify Studios and <em>The Ringer</em> in the new year, and according to a new report, agents at leading talent agencies are being sounded out ahead of a Q1 push.</p>
<p>Sources have told <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-video-podcasts-1236417771/"><em><ins>The Hollywood Reporter</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that Netflix has sent “dozens of requests&quot; to agents at WME, UTA and CAA as it looks to add more video podcasts to the platform. The plan is that the company launches its video podcast offering in early 2026, by which time it wants to have a library of shows with existing audiences.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This comes after <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-03/netflix-is-in-talks-to-license-video-podcasts-from-iheartmedia"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported this week that Netflix is also in licensing talks with iHeartMedia, which is one of the largest podcasts publishers in the world and makes shows like <em>Stuff You Should Know </em>and <em>The Breakfast Club</em>. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s sources, Netflix wants an exclusivity deal that would mean featured shows would no longer be uploaded to YouTube. The latter is Spotify’s biggest rival in the space, and passed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube-passes-1-billion-monthly-active-podcast-viewers-225223309.html"><ins>one billion</ins></a> monthly active podcast viewers at the start of 2025.</p>
<p>The Spotify deal Netflix penned last month includes nine sports podcasts at launch, among them <em>The Bill Simmons Podcast </em>and <em>The Zach Lowe Show</em>. Other video podcasts coming to the streaming service include <em>Serial Killers </em>and <em>The Ringer</em>’s <em>The Rewatchables</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-reportedly-going-big-on-video-podcasts-for-2026-133025499.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle.</p>

The search giant wants to put its AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), into orbit aboard solar panel-equipped satellites. “In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute,” wrote Google senior director Travis Beals. &quot;In the right orbit, a solar panel can be up to 8 times more productive than on Earth, and produce power nearly continuously, reducing the need for batteries.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Suffice to say, the idea poses numerous challenges. That proximity to the sun would expose the TPUs to high levels of radiation that can rapidly degrade electronic components. However, Google has tested its current chips for radiation tolerance and said they&#39;d be able to survive a five year mission without suffering permanent failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another challenge is the high-speed data links of &quot;tens of terabits per second&quot; and low latency required between satellites. Those speeds would be hard to achieve in space, as transmitting data at long distances requires exponentially more power than on Earth. To achieve that, Google said it may need to maneuver TPU-equipped satellites into tight formations, possibly within &quot;kilometers or less&quot; of each other. That would have the added benefit of reducing &quot;station keeping&quot; thrust maneuvers needed to keep the satellites in the right position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The determining factor, though, is money. Launching TPUs into space may not seem cost-efficient, but Google&#39;s analysis shows that doing so could be &quot;roughly comparable&quot; to data centers on Earth (in terms of power efficiency) by around the mid-2030s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it&#39;s currently only a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/suncatcher_paper.pdf">preliminary research paper</a>, Google is planning to put Project Suncatcher through some initial trials. It has teamed with a company called <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.planet.com/">Planet</a> on a &quot;learning mission&quot; to launch a pair of prototype satellites into orbit by 2027. &quot;This experiment will test how our models and TPU hardware operate in space and validate the use of optical inter-satellite links for distributed ML [machine learning] tasks,&quot; Google wrote.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After launching it in China earlier, DJI has unveiled its flagship smartphone gimbal, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:DJI;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DJI&amp;linkText=Osmo+Mobile+8&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kamkuY29tL29zbW8tbW9iaWxlLTgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjliNjI2YjMyLWY1NmMtNDIxNC1iODgyLThkNWY5ZDEzMDA0MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGppLmNvbS9vc21vLW1vYmlsZS04In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQ2codZo2pbWsy5AQ_akQRKSJHJAYbLFARAa0YEx4mwE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fosmo-mobile-8" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.dji.com/osmo-mobile-8">Osmo Mobile 8</a> in the US and elsewhere. The new model looks much like the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-mobile-7p-gimbal-can-track-you-around-on-any-android-or-ios-camera-app-130037243.html">Osmo Mobile 7P</a> and has the same Multifunctional tracking module with a built-in light. However, it adds a bunch of useful new functionality including Apple DockKit support, 360-degree panning and pet tracking.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The lack of Apple DockKit support was an issue with the Osmo Mobile 7P, as it made tracking yourself trickier with some apps. It also put DJI behind <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360s-flow-pro-2-gimbal-offers-a-sturdier-build-and-a-selfie-mirror-130016865.html">Insta360&#39;s Flow 2 Pro</a>, which does support DockKit. That&#39;s no longer an issue with the Osmo Mobile 8, though. You can now do subject tracking within the native iPhone camera app or any of the 200-plus iOS applications compatible with DockKit.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>At the same time, full tracking is available via the Multifunctional Module. That attaches to the side of its updated, more secure magnetic phone mount, letting you track yourself or other subjects automatically with any camera app. It includes a surprisingly powerful LED fill light and works as a receiver for DJI&#39;s wireless microphones, including the Mic Mini, Mic 2 and Mic 3. On top of humans, the module now supports dog and cat tracking as well. As before, it also supports gesture control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another key feature is a pan axis that supports 360 degree horizontal rotation that no longer hits a stop as before. That means when you lock onto moving subjects with intelligent tracking, it&#39;ll keep following them even if they go all the way around the camera. The updated, more comfortable grip (and 0.8 pound weight) also makes it easier to take low angle shots, something that that will be handy when trying to follow your cat around.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When using DJI&#39;s Mimo app, you also get access to DJI&#39;s advanced ActiveTrack 7.0.1 tracking tech. It comes with a feature called Dual Lens Boost 2 that uses your phones wide-angle and telephoto lenses to make sure a subject isn&#39;t lost, even if they move quickly or within a crowded scene. Another feature, Smart Capture, makes it easy to switch between subjects, even in complex environments, according to DJI.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The OM8 uses DJI&#39;s latest three-axis stabilization tech to smooth even jarring movements without hurting quality like a smartphone can do. Other features include an integrated tripod, easy switching between front and rear cameras (along with the ability to flip the camera 180 degrees for rear camera selfies), an integrated tripod and a built-in extension rod.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DJI&#39;s Osmo Mobile 8 gimbal is now available in Europe for 159 euros, but won&#39;t be sold on DJI&#39;s US site due to what DJI calls &quot;evolving market conditions.&quot; However, it&#39;s now available on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FJ2L67HJ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAZiQqzZtEtqvrd64kFerxUt2SLhGlyQuhyUw3HWrd_-5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDJI-6937224126817-Osmo-Mobile%2Fdp%2FB0FJ2L67HJ%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-6937224126817-Osmo-Mobile/dp/B0FJ2L67HJ/ref=sr_1_1">Amazon</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;linkText=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xOTE3NjgzLVJFRy9kamlfY3Bfb3NfMDAwMDA0OTJfMDNfb3Ntb19tb2JpbGVfOC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YjYyNmIzMi1mNTZjLTQyMTQtYjg4Mi04ZDVmOWQxMzAwNDEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJocGhvdG92aWRlby5jb20vYy9wcm9kdWN0LzE5MTc2ODMtUkVHL2RqaV9jcF9vc18wMDAwMDQ5Ml8wM19vc21vX21vYmlsZV84Lmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZm33-mPAUfT6S2QY7N6XmBBNnvP6AKXDhe9zbmSI6Qn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1917683-REG%2Fdji_cp_os_00000492_03_osmo_mobile_8.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1917683-REG/dji_cp_os_00000492_03_osmo_mobile_8.html">B&amp;H Photo Video</a> and other third-party stores for $149.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google and Epic Games have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-proposes-app-store-reforms-settlement-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-2025-11-05/">reached a settlement</a> that would bring their <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-match-google-antitrust-lawsuit-trial-date-223014942.html">years-long court battle</a> to a close. The companies have filed a proposal in the federal court of San Francisco, asking US District Judge James Donato to approve a modified version of the order he originally imposed on Google when it lost the case. &quot;Together with Epic Games we have filed a proposed set of changes to Android and Google Play that focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe,&quot; said Sameer Samat, the President of Android Ecosystem at Google, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343">on X</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613">praised</a> the proposal for &quot;genuinely [doubling] down on Android&#39;s original vision as an open platform to streamline competing store installs globally, reduce service fees for developers on Google Play and enable third-party in-app and web payments.&quot; Epic Games sued Google in 2020, accusing it of an illegal monopoly on app distribution and in-app billing services for Android devices.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The court <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/jury-sides-with-epic-games-in-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-032341810.html">sided with Epic Games</a> in late 2023, and Google <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-lost-its-antitrust-case-with-epic-again-190633325.html">lost its appeal</a> in July this year. Google tried to <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-asks-supreme-court-to-rescue-it-from-its-epic-lawsuit-195555490.html">ask the Supreme Court</a> to block the injunction Donato handed down, which required the company to make major changes to the Play Store, while it appealed the case again. But the Supreme Court <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/supreme-court-denies-googles-request-to-pause-play-store-changes-while-it-appeals-epic-case-121502132.html">denied its request</a>. That means Google will be prohibited from paying manufacturers and app developers to exclusively install and distribute on the Play Store, respectively. It will also be prohibited from forcing developers to only use its payment system, and it will have to allow third-party app stores to be installed on Android devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google will still have to follow most of Donato&#39;s orders under the proposal, but the companies made some modifications. To start with, they&#39;ve worked out how to &quot;allow developers and users to seamlessly use alternative payment mechanisms,&quot; both in-app and via external links, while adhering to Google&#39;s security and safety standards. They&#39;ve also specified the maximum fees Google can charge for external payments, which are 9 percent or 20 percent, depending on the type of transaction. The companies have identified &quot;reasonable, neutral criteria&quot; that third-party stores would be required to meet, as well. Users will easily be able to download stores that meet those criteria so they can compete against the Play Store and each other around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samat said that the companies are meeting with Judge Donato on Thursday, and if he approves of the proposal, it &quot;would resolve [the] litigations.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-and-epic-games-reach-settlement-for-antitrust-lawsuit-120019374.html?src=rss]]></description>

The best budget models strike a great balance between price and performance, giving you smooth everyday use without cutting too many corners. Whether you’re scrolling social media, streaming your favorite shows or snapping photos of a night out, there’s an affordable Android phone that can handle it all.<br><br>Cheaper phones have come a long way in recent years. Many now feature bright, fast displays, reliable cameras and battery life that lasts well into the next day. You might miss out on top-tier extras like the latest processor or ultra-high-resolution zoom, but what you get instead is value that makes sense. Some models even surprise with cameras that rival far pricier flagships, making them ideal for casual photographers or anyone who just wants to capture a great shot on the go.<br><br>We’ve tested budget Android phones from brands like Google, Samsung and OnePlus to find the ones that deliver the most for less. These are the models that prove you don’t need a flagship price tag to get a dependable Android phone.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-cheap-should-you-go-for-an-android-phone">How cheap should you go for an Android phone?</h2> 
<p>We tend to define a budget smartphone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises in function, and above that, you cross over to pricier <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html">midrange handsets</a> (if you&#39;re open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorite flagship phones at the very end of this guide).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies, WiFi browsing or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 Samsung phones and other Android devices have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better phone cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-android-phone">What to look for in a cheap Android phone</h2> 
<p>When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-price-difference-for-a-cheap-android-vs-a-cheap-iphone">What&#39;s the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone?</h3> 
<p>iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-magsafe-power-bank">What to consider before buying a MagSafe power bank</h2> 
<p><strong>Choose the right capacity</strong>. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time.</p> 
<p><strong>Understand MagSafe versus Qi2</strong>. All iPhones model 12 and later have MagSafe technology, which rely on embedded magnets to align the phone with a wireless charger and can support charging speeds of up to 15 watts. The MagSafe name is owned by Apple — third-party chargers can’t freely use the term and instead call their accessories “magnetic,” or apply a branded name like Anker’s MagGo or UGreen’s MagFlow. Be sure to check the product details before buying: anything that works with Apple’s technology will be listed as MagSafe-compatible.</p> 
<p>Qi2 is a standard from the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/about-us/">Wireless Power Consortium</a> (of which Apple is a member) and has the same stipulations as MagSafe (15W charging and magnetic alignment). Any company can submit their tech for this certification. iPhones 13 and later are Qi2 compatible.</p> 
<p>The newest standard, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qi2-25w-wireless-charging-is-coming-to-iphones-and-major-android-smartphones-183013979.html">Qi2 25W</a> (also called Qi2.2), bumps wireless charging speeds up to 25W. The WPC <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/">says</a> a certified smartphone using a certified charger can wirelessly go from dead to half full in about 30 minutes (keep in mind that both the charger <em>and</em> phone need to be certified to get those speeds) and that aligns with our testing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Accessories, like power banks that support the new standard are starting to hit shelves now. As for phones, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL, Apple’s iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max all support the standard as well. iPhone 16 models (except the 16e)<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/23/ios-26-adds-qi2-25w-support-to-iphone-16-series/#:~:text=iPhone%2017%20Pro-,iOS%2026%20Adds%2025W%20Qi2%20Wireless%20Charging%20Support%20to%20iPhone,to%20the%20iPhone%2016%20series."> support</a> the standard after an update to iOS 26.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember travel restrictions</strong>. You may have seen <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://news.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html">news reports</a> of flights being grounded because a power bank caught fire in the cabin. Currently, the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">TSA allows</a> them in your carry-on luggage as long as they’re rated at 100 watt-hours or lower (about 27,000mAh for lithium ion batteries).</p> 
<p>But some airlines have enacted further restrictions. <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/travel/southwest-airlines-tightens-rules-visible-portable-chargers">Southwest</a>, for example, requires you to keep power banks out of the bag and visible while charging. Even if your airline doesn’t make such demands, keeping a power brick out in the open while it’s in use is a good idea — it’ll keep it cooler and you’ll be more likely to notice if it starts to overheat. Most, if not all, MagSafe battery packs come in at under the 100-watt-hour limit, so traveling should be easy with one.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider the extra features</strong>. You may not need them, but the little extra perks of a MagSafe power bank can come in handy. Some have stands so you can watch your phone while it refills. Some have LED displays that tell you how much charge is left, which can be a little more precise than the lighted pips other banks use. Some also have straps to make the bank easier to carry around or fish out of your bag.</p>

It’s now the sole Apple-branded MagSafe power bank — but it only works with the iPhone Air. It’s a pretty divisive battery.

It has the same minimalist look and pocketable thinness as Apple’s proprietary battery, but it’ll attach to other phones in addition to the Air. Plus it’s $35 cheaper.</p>

It makes excellent use of its 5K capacity, delivering a 90 percent refill to an iPhone 15. But it’s a little more expensive than the our top slim pick, Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim, and the squared off design makes it feel bulkier than it actually is. Neither of those make it a bad choice; the MagSafe battery playing field is just terribly competitive right now.</p>

The feel is premium and the stand is sturdy, but it got quite hot during charging, took overly long to refill itself and is pricer and a bit bulkier than similar models.</p>

It’s Qi2-certified and delivered a 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. The slim slab of the Anker Nano battery is sleeker.

<h2 id="jump-link-magsafe-power-banks-faqs">MagSafe power banks FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-does-magsafe-do"><strong>What does MagSafe do?</strong></h3> 
<p>MagSafe is Apple’s own technology that supports up to 25W wireless charging speeds and incorporates embedded magnets to align the phone with chargers and other accessories.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-iphones-support-magsafe"><strong>Which iPhones support MagSafe?</strong></h3> 
<p>iPhones 12 and later support 15W MagSafe technology, though only iPhones 13 and later can reach the 15W charging speed with third-party Qi2 accessories. The iPhone 12 maxes out at 7.5W with non-Apple accessories.</p> 
<p>The new iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max support up to 25W charging speeds with Qi2 25W-certified chargers. iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max should also support those speeds after an update to iOS 26. The iPhone Air supports MagSafe charging at a max speed of 20W.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-use-magsafe-batteries-with-a-case"><strong>Can you use MagSafe batteries with a case?</strong></h3> 
<p>In most cases (heh), yes. The wireless charge can travel across a distance of a few millimeters. If the case is more than 5mm thick or contains metal components, the wireless charge can be blocked. Many iPhone cases are marketed as MagSafe-compatible, which means the case itself has complimentary magnets inside and should not interfere with charging accessories. We tested a MagSafe power bank on an iPhone 15 with and without a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Target;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=827d7835-78d6-4491-ae04-c042cab1d6e7&amp;itemId=impact_radius_2092-89182367&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8986e106-bf40-49ec-b584-64a9e8a0f01c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Target&amp;linkText=MagSafe+case&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXJnZXQuY29tL3AvYXBwbGUtaXBob25lLTE1LWlwaG9uZS0xNC1pcGhvbmUtMTMtc3F1YXJlLWNhc2Utd2l0aC1tYWdzYWZlLWhleWRheS04NDgyLW5lb24tcGluay8tL0EtODkxODIzNjciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg5ODZlMTA2LWJmNDAtNDllYy1iNTg0LTY0YTllOGEwZjAxYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFyZ2V0LmNvbS9wL2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xNS1pcGhvbmUtMTQtaXBob25lLTEzLXNxdWFyZS1jYXNlLXdpdGgtbWFnc2FmZS1oZXlkYXktODQ4Mi1uZW9uLXBpbmsvLS9BLTg5MTgyMzY3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUGgNj_ET-0ZFYIyAHqke8Ggxi354PCsqFupVdglJJWE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-iphone-15-iphone-14-iphone-13-square-case-with-magsafe-heyday-8482-neon-pink%2F-%2FA-89182367" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-15-iphone-14-iphone-13-square-case-with-magsafe-heyday-8482-neon-pink/-/A-89182367">MagSafe case</a> and got the same charging speeds and amounts in both tests.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-power-do-magsafe-batteries-provide"><strong>How much power do MagSafe batteries provide?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the power bank. If it is Qi2-certified, it can provide up to 15 watts of wireless power. Qi2 25W-enabled chargers can deliver up to 25 watts to a compatible handset. Non-Qi2 batteries typically deliver around 7.5 watts.</p> 
<p>The amount of charge delivered depends on the capacity. Most MagSafe portable chargers are rated at 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh. The former can get a standard iPhone 15 from five percent to around 90 percent. The latter can fill the phone completely with enough left over for another half charge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Motorola just announced the Edge 70 smartphone, which is an ultra-thin handset that could rival the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html"><ins>recently-launched Apple iPhone Air</ins></a>. It&#39;s a bit thicker than the Air, at 5.9mm compared to 5.6mm, but the camera bump is less noticeable.</p>
<p>As for that camera bump, the Edge 70 features a trio of 50MP camera sensors. The main camera can capture 4K video and there&#39;s also a front camera, an ultrawide with a macro lens and a dedicated light sensor. Like most modern smartphones, there are AI tools available for photo editing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The frame is made from &quot;aircraft-grade aluminum,&quot; which is a good thing because my uncoordinated fingers will absolutely be dropping this thing within three days of owning one. Other durability features include Corning Gorilla Glass 7i and IP69 water protection.</p>

<p>The phone will also have access to the company&#39;s proprietary moto ai2 chatbot. This can do all of the usual stuff like create images and answer queries. However, Motorola also boasts that the AI can understand what&#39;s on the screen and can point users to the correct course of action. We&#39;ll have to wait and see how that works in real life.</p>
<p>This skinny handset somehow includes a massive 4800mAh battery that allows up to 50 hours of continuous use. That&#39;s over two full days of doomscrolling without ever heading to the power outlet. As a comparison, the iPhone Air <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-air-is-apples-thinnest-phone-yet-174342422.html"><ins>lasts anywhere from</ins></a> 22 to 27 hours</p>
<p>The Edge 70 ships with a magnetic case that can handle wireless charging and includes a Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile chipset. Motorola promises active software support and security upgrades all the way until 2031.</p>
<p>Given the form factor and specs, the price is actually fairly reasonable. The Edge 70 starts at £700, which breaks down to around $910 USD. It&#39;s available for purchase right now, but there&#39;s a spot of bad news. It&#39;s launching in the UK and there&#39;s no current information as to when it&#39;ll cross the pond.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-motorola-edge-70-is-another-ridiculously-thin-smartphone-080009244.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can be challenging for us humans to wrap our brains around really massive numbers. Even the scale of a million or billion is pretty hard for most people to really comprehend. So prepare yourself to think big, because scientists have recorded the largest and most distant black hole flare to date, and the numbers around it are pretty staggering.&nbsp;</p><p>The event occurred at an active galactic nucleus, also known as an accreting or feeding black hole, that they predict is 500 million times more massive than our sun and is located 10 billion light years away. The researchers suspect that this flare was caused by a tidal disruption event, where the gravity of the AGN may have pulled a nearby star closer and consumed it. The team estimates that the star eaten by the black hole had a mass 30 times that of our system&#39;s own sun. And according to the layperson <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/black-hole-flare-is-biggest-and-most-distant-seen" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post</a> from Caltech about the event, &quot;at its brightest, the flare shined with the light of 10 trillion suns.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is unlike any AGN we&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; said Matthew Graham, who was a co-principal investigator on the study as well as a research professor of astronomy at Caltech and project scientist for the Zwicky Transient Facility, which first observed the black hole in question in 2018 along with the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey. The research about the AGN and its bonkers flare appeared in the journal <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0ae3b3e9-580a-443e-8c24-24917fb143d0&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;linkText=Nature+Astronomy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3M0MTU1MC0wMjUtMDI2OTktMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGFlM2IzZTktNTgwYS00NDNlLThjMjQtMjQ5MTdmYjE0M2QwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3M0MTU1MC0wMjUtMDI2OTktMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARkbdRToW5JM9M_fL5hyMqpahKwZ0KYU_MtJxPBjfqr2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41550-025-02699-0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nature Research;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02699-0"><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/scientists-observed-a-black-hole-flare-that-shined-with-the-light-of-10-trillion-suns-235414438.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve is bringing a helpful update to the Steam Deck, adding an option for downloading content while the screen is off. The company is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">calling</a> it a display-off low-power mode. It will be enabled by default when the Steam Deck is plugged in. The handheld&#39;s power settings can also allow it to be active while on battery power, although it will automatically revert to full sleep mode if the battery drops below 20 percent. If a user hits the power button while the Steam Deck is downloading content, a dialogue prompt will appear asking if the download should continue with the display off. A Steam Deck that reaches an idle timeout will also automatically go into the display-off low-power mode.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, this is similar to the rest mode modern consoles have that allows for downloads while the machine isn&#39;t being actively used. This feature can be really useful if you&#39;re playing an online competitive game and don&#39;t want a big download infringing on your bandwidth. (I speak from experience here.) Nice for the Steam Deck to offer a similar convenience to its players.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-adds-a-standby-mode-for-screen-off-downloads-230334579.html?src=rss]]></description>

The browser securely stores log-in credentials for websites locally, and uses them to make purchases for customers on Amazon with a simple command.&nbsp;</p><p>Perplexity and Amazon agreed to pause agentic shopping on Amazon in November 2024, according to the report, but when Comet was released, Perplexity allowed it again. By representing the Comet agent as a Chrome browser user rather than a bot, the company allegedly tried to get around the agreement, until Amazon found out and sent its cease-and-desist letter.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon posted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-perplexity-comet-statement" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">the statement</a> below on its blog, openly acknowledging the issues it has with Perplexity: </p><blockquote><p>We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate. This helps ensure a positive customer experience and it is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers. Agentic third-party applications such as Perplexity’s Comet have the same obligations, and we’ve repeatedly requested that Perplexity remove Amazon from the Comet experience, particularly in light of the significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.</p></blockquote><p>Complicating Amazon’s claims, Perplexity might be a future shopping rival. Amazon demoed its own AI shopping agent called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-buy-for-me-ai-will-purchase-stuff-from-third-party-websites-123036361.html" data-i13n="slk:&#x00201c;Buy for Me&#x00201d;;cpos:7;pos:1">“Buy for Me”</a> in April 2025. But Perplexity also disagrees with the fundamentals of Amazon&#39;s argument. &quot;User agents are exactly that: agents of the user,&quot; Perplexity says. &quot;They&#39;re distinct from crawlers, scrapers, or bots.&quot; Perplexity believes the Comet agent shouldn&#39;t run afoul of Amazon&#39;s terms and conditions then because it acts on the users&#39; behalf, with the users&#39; permission.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Perplexity has been accused of misrepresenting its AI tools to access content. In August, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-is-allegedly-scraping-websites-its-not-supposed-to-again-211110756.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Cloudflare claimed</a> that the company&#39;s bots were accessing blocked websites by pretending to be a normal Chrome browser user on macOS.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a case of deja vu, Stellantis is once again <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/04/jeep-recalling-375000-wrangler-grand-cherokee-4xe-phevs/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">recalling</a> two models of its Jeep brand plug-in hybrid SUVs. The company has recalled at least 320,000 of its Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe cars in the US over concerns of fire risks while driving and while parked. Stellantis is also recalling 20,753 of the Jeep vehicles in Canada, 2,653 in Mexico, and 32,238 outside of North America. A <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=27207&amp;mid=" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">statement</a> from Stellantis said an internal investigation discovered 19 fires. </p><p>Jeep also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/jeep-recalls-194000-plug-in-hybrids-due-to-fire-risks-150059282.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">recalled</a> these same two 4xe models in October 2024. The issue then and now was with the EV batteries produced by Samsung SDI. Stellantis has been unable to address the fire risks with software updates and is expected to notify drivers when a remedy for the issue is ready. Until then, the owners of Grand Cherokee 4xe models from 2022 to 2026 and Wrangler 4xe models from 2020 to 2025 are being encouraged to park outside away from buildings and not to plug in their vehicles. So basically these cars are relegated to being very large sculptures until Stellanis can fix the battery problems. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-recalls-more-than-375000-jeep-hybrid-suvs-for-fire-risk-215341226.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/polestar-live-lane-guidance/">is bringing</a> live lane guidance to Google Maps in cars with the company’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html">built-in</a> infotainment system, starting with the<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-4-first-look-when-no-rear-window-makes-for-a-better-car-150052884.html"> Polestar 4</a>. Using the vehicle&#39;s front-facing camera, Google Maps will be able to &quot;see&quot; the road just as the driver does. It will then create more detailed depictions of which lane a driver should be in and guide them using visual and audio cues.</p>
<p>Google says the new feature uses AI to analyze lane markings and road signs, which it then integrates in real time with Google Maps&#39; navigation system. Google paints a picture of fewer missed exits, as its navigation system reminds drivers in the left lane that their exit is coming up on the right side of the highway.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Details are scarce on where exactly this will function. In Google&#39;s blog post announcing the feature, the company says it will expand live lane guidance to &quot;more road types&quot; in the future. We&#39;ve reached out for clarification.</p>
<p>Live lane guidance with Google Maps will be rolling out on the Polestar 4 in the US and Sweden over the coming months. Google says it will expand to include more cars in partnership with other automakers.</p>
<p><strong>Update Nov 4 3:39 PM EST: Google says the feature will only work on highways for now.</strong></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/google-maps-is-adding-live-lane-guidance-for-the-polestar-4-192705050.html?src=rss]]></description>

It’s a lovely thing, and I use it often to keep a note of all the concerts I have coming up. For 2026, though, I’m going to need something different: a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Balatro</em></a><em> </em>wall calendar that features actor Ben Starr as the game’s mascot, Jimbo, in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/fangamer.com/post/3m4sz26vxr22t" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">variety of scenarios</a>.</p><p>You’ll see Jimbo as Santa Claus and a vampire. There’s a photo of him in baseball garb and another of him eating ice cream. There’s even a shot of Jimbo with carefully placed bananas (a nod to the game’s handy banana cards) akin to that one shot of Mena Suvari in <em>American Beauty</em>.  Starr is a logical pick for this as he previously dressed up as Jimbo to promote the game and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AamFDYUaMhM" data-i13n="slk:accept a BAFTA;cpos:3;pos:1">accept a BAFTA</a> on behalf of developer LocalThunk.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new year is coming... time to shuffle off and try again!<br><br>The Balatro 2026 Wall Calendar is available now: <a href="https://t.co/EHlzJDOIIm">https://t.co/EHlzJDOIIm</a> <a href="https://t.co/ugnooDdLoW">pic.twitter.com/ugnooDdLoW</a></p>— Fangamer (@Fangamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fangamer/status/1985753915288101008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote>

The company is a key player in the consortium behind the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards, and this week it announced that the group is developing a version called HDR10+ Advanced. Amazon Prime Video has already signed on to support this format when it becomes available.</p><p><em>Forbes</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2025/11/03/samsung-responds-to-dolby-vision-2-with-new-hdr10-advanced-standard-and-a-major-streamer-is-already-onboard/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reported</a> on the six upgrades that are in the works with HDR10+ Advanced. The revised standard is expected to have an increased brightness range, genre-based options for tone mapping and picture processing, intelligent motion-smoothing options, a mode for cloud gaming, more zones for local tone mapping, and more advanced and accurate color performance. According to the publication, HDR10+ Advanced will likely debut on Samsung&#39;s 2026 TV lineup. If that is the case, we can expect to hear more about HDR10+ Advanced in January at CES 2026 when the company usually unveils the year’s TV models. </p><p>Samsung is also collaborating with Google on an audio project that would be a counterpart to Dolby Atmos called Eclipsa Audio, but the details on that have been a little sparse since a brief <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-isnt-talking-about-eclipsa-audio-at-ces-2025-130041782.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">announcement</a> at CES 2025.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-is-working-on-hdr10-advanced-to-take-on-dolby-vision-2-202410665.html?src=rss]]></description>

The expansion is notable, not only because Live Translation was a key selling point of the recently released AirPods Pro 3, but also because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-repeats-its-long-held-criticism-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-130058440.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the company warned</a> in September that complying with the EU&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Digital Markets Act</a> could delay the feature.</p><p>When Live Translation becomes available in the EU on AirPods Pro 3, Pro 2 and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> next month, the feature will automatically translate a speaker&#39;s voice between English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional Mandarin), Japanese and Korean. Live Translation can also seamlessly translate between pairs of AirPods, intelligently lowering a speaker&#39;s voice so the translation is easier to hear.&nbsp;</p><p>In September, Apple blamed a potential delay on &quot;additional engineering&quot; that was required to make sure translated conversations stay private, with the company specifically trying to &quot;make sure [conversations] won’t be exposed to other companies or developers.&quot; The wait for the feature should be worth it, though.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/04/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> its latest batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in November. Monthly subscribers have a lot to look forward to, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> on day one of its release.</p>
<p>Kicking off the release slate is <em>Dead Static Drive</em> on November 5. This indie survival-horror game takes players on a 1980s-style road trip across the country. <em>Dead Static Drive</em> will share its date with <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>, a tactical third-person combat game with rich sniper mechanics that sports a co-op campaign for playing with friends.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The very next day will feature the real star of this month&#39;s Game Pass releases, and no, I don&#39;t mean COD. I&#39;m talking about <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-supernatural-detective-mystery-fmv-terror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000853.html"><em>Egging On</em></a>, the platformer where you play as a literal egg trying to escape your hen house. You&#39;ll have to traverse harrowing obstacles and terrifying heights armed with little more than your fragile shell. <em>Whiskerwood</em>, a strategy and worldbuilding game where mice must build and manage colonies at the behest of a feline overlord, will be available on the same day.</p>
<p>The games keep coming over the following days with <em>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris </em>and <em>Pigeon Simulator </em>available on November 11. <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> drops on November 14 and will feature 16 6v6 maps and two 20v20 maps at launch.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">recently raised the price</a> on the highest tier of the Xbox Game Pass subscription to $30 per month from $20 per month. That made Game Pass Ultimate 50 percent more expensive than previously. The tiers also underwent some rebranding as well, but the big thing to note is that you’ll need that $30/month Ultimate tier to play games on release day. This came after price increases in 2024 as well.</p>
<p>See the full list of Xbox Game Pass additions below, as well as a list of games leaving on November 15. The list also specifies which tier of Game Pass you&#39;ll need for each title.</p>

The game&#39;s director Josh Sawyer digs into the thinking behind the update in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a trailer</a> Obsidian released alongside the update announcement, but in brief, the mode attempts to faithfully adapt characters&#39; stats for turn-based combat, while making it easy to switch from real-time to turn-based modes on the fly.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Obsidian last returned to Eora, the setting of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, in the excellent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-review-elder-scrolls-i-dont-know-her-140057830.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Avowed</em></a> from earlier this year. That game translated the series&#39; world and combat systems into a first-person RPG in the style of <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.

This is a good thing, as Nintendo&#39;s latest console only works with microSD Express cards and, to be honest, there aren&#39;t that many options <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">out there for consumers</a>.</p> 
<p>The company boasts that these new cards feature maximum sequential read speeds up to 800MB/s, which is a mighty fine metric and in league with some of our other <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-070011952.html">favorite cards for the Switch 2</a>. The cards also include the company&#39;s Dynamic Thermal Guard (DTG) technology, which was originally developed for SSDs.

<p>Of course, these cards aren&#39;t tied to the Switch 2. That&#39;s just the most common use case scenario. They&#39;ll work with just about anything, like tablets, drones, cameras and rival portable gaming consoles.</p> 
<p>Samsung&#39;s P9 Express microSD cards are available now, and the price is in line with similar offerings. The 256GB model costs $55 and the 512GB version costs $100.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>There’s a lot more riding on Amazon’s latest batch of Echo hardware than usual. After all, these are the first devices arriving alongside Alexa+, the AI-powered revamp of the company’s signature voice assistant. And unlike the $220 Echo Studio, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazons-new-echo-dot-max-is-a-smart-speaker-for-alexa-150222265.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">new Echo Dot Max</a> is a more affordable ($100) and compact entry point into using Alexa+. It’s also another example of how <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/why-does-amazon-need-five-tv-streamers-163014576.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">confusing Amazon’s hardware lineup can get</a>: the older Echo Pop ($40) and Echo Dot ($50) are also getting Alexa+. The Echo Dot Max isn’t the cheapest Echo, nor is it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the best-sounding speaker Amazon sells</a>. So, where does it fit?</p>
<p>The best way to think about this new speaker is that it occupies the same spot in Amazon’s lineup as the venerable and discontinued device simply named “Echo.” For years, the Amazon Echo was the company’s main speaker, but it no longer sells one with that pleasantly concise name. The Echo Dot Max steps in at the same price point, though. And while my testing has shown that Alexa+ is a solid step forward, the Dot Max hardware itself isn’t as good as what it replaces.</p>

<h2 id="89cab343-8b58-44ee-b20d-eb4c3de7a859">Design</h2>
<p>The Echo Dot Max feels immediately familiar if you’ve seen any of Amazon’s spherical smart speakers from the last five years or so, but there are numerous design changes here. The 2020 Echo and current Echo Dot have buttons on top for adjusting volume and muting the speaker’s microphone. Those buttons are now on a front-facing panel that is surrounded by the Echo’s signature light ring. While I liked how the light ring encircled the bottom of the Echo, it’s definitely easier to see in this new front-facing position and it’s particularly better at displaying the volume now. Overall, it’s a fairly refined and subtle device, which is exactly what you want from a smart speaker. I tested the graphite model, but you can also get it in white or a much bolder purple. I prefer the fully spherical, globe-like appearance of the Echo Dot, but there’s little to complain about here visually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have some quibbles about the front-facing volume and mute buttons, though. The Echo Dot Max is simply so light that if I press the controls I’ll push the speaker around the shelf it’s on. This is easily solved by putting your hand around it and pressing the buttons with your thumb, but if you reach out to it with your index finger it probably won’t stay in place. I guess you’re supposed to primarily interact with the Echo Dot Max with your voice, but top-mounted buttons would’ve avoided this problem. I imagine this isn’t as much of a problem with the similarly-designed Echo Studio, simply because it’s much larger and three times heavier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="e91de0be-b900-49ee-9442-3df6720d200f">Audio quality</h2>
<p>I’m a pretty big music nerd and I’ve listened to many smart speakers over the years. I’ve come away impressed with the Echo devices <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-21-amazon-echo-plus-dot-sub-2018-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">I tested in 2018</a> as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-2020-review-130046336.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the 2020 Echo</a> I spoke about earlier. At $100, that Echo punched well above its weight and sounded notably better than the identically-priced HomePod Mini and Nest Audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Echo Dot Max does not match that older speaker’s bonafides. Don’t get me wrong, it sounds just fine —&nbsp;better than a standard Echo Dot and in line with what I’d expect from a $100 speaker. It’s a good bit louder than my HomePod Mini, with plenty of volume to fill a medium-sized room on its own. If you’re looking to really pump music through a bigger room, though, you’re better off looking at the Echo Studio or something like the Sonos Era 100. You can also pair two Echo Dot Max speakers together for stereo playback and increased volume, but I didn’t get to test this so can’t say how it’ll perform in a larger space.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint with the Echo Dot Max is that frequencies often felt a bit smushed together, without a solid bass thump separating itself from the clarity in the mid- and high-range frequencies. It doesn’t provide the most dynamic listening experience. When you look at the difference in the Echo Dot Max’s speaker components compared to the fourth-generation Echo, that’s not a surprise. That older speaker paired a 3-inch woofer with dual 0.8-inch tweeters, while the Dot Max makes do with just one tweeter and a smaller 2.5-inch woofer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that the Echo Dot Max still sounds good! The various beats, electronic glitches and vocals of Lorde’s “What Was That” came through clearly for the most part, and the modern disco vibes of “Jealous” by The Aces had a nice thump and the instruments were plenty punchy. The heavier, guitar-driven fury of albums like the new Deftones release <em>Private Music </em>and the 33-year-old <em>Dirt</em> by Alice In Chains came through loud and clear, while turning up the volume on the rave-esque vibes of “As Alive As You Need Me To Be” by Nine Inch Nails had plenty of life. But while the overall sound was pleasant enough, further listening made me realize that details like a good snap of a snare could get lost amidst a storm of guitars.</p>
<p>It’s a disappointment that Amazon took an undeniable step backwards here. Much like the Echo Studio that we just reviewed, the Echo Dot Max isn’t bad — it’s just underwhelming. It’s a little easier to forgive here, since the Dot Max is more of an all-purpose speaker rather than something designed to provide an exceptional listening experience. Again, it sounds totally fine for a $100 smart speaker, but given Amazon’s past success in providing surprisingly excellent audio, I was hoping for a lot more here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="6043e050-11ab-4a09-95a4-987409566694">Alexa+</h2>
<p>The other piece of the puzzle is, of course, Alexa+, Amazon’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">long-awaited update to its digital assistant</a>. Somehow, it’s already been two years since Amazon <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-is-evolving-into-a-chatbot-for-your-home-152654742.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">first showed off</a> the improvements it was working on delivering with Alexa+. But with these new devices, “early access” to the service is pretty easy to come by now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll admit that I’m not much of a voice assistant guy. I think a lot of that comes from not having a very smart home. I’ve been renting for the last eight months after owning a home for almost a decade, and there just hasn’t been much to do with Alexa (or any voice assistant) at the moment.</p>
<p>But even without home-based routines to run, lights to control or a smart thermostat to adjust, it was evident how much more conversational and context-aware Alexa+ is now. I did a lot of testing during the World Series and I made it a habit to ask Alexa what was going on in the series. We had several “conversations” about what happened in the previous night’s game, when the next game was happening, who the starting pitchers were and so forth. It was probably the most natural experience I’ve ever had using a voice assistant, even though using my natural language with a speaker still feels awkward. (I definitely said please to Alexa more than once.)</p>
<p>Once you’re set up with Alexa+ Early Access, you can use the same updated assistant in the Alexa app on your smartphone, either with your voice or in a chat interface. The chatbot-style Alexa experience is fine, but I actually prefer using my voice, because I felt like it was easier to have a conversation with it and just ask things as they popped into my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good thing about Alexa+ is that it felt fast and responsive. There are short pauses while it thinks about a response, but it usually got back to me quickly enough that continuing that natural language conversation didn’t feel stilted or awkward. Speed is a crucial factor towards making a voice assistant feel responsive, and Alexa+ on the Echo Dot Max hits on that point. Some combo of Amazon’s AZ3 chip and whatever is happening up in its cloud is getting the job done here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with any voice assistant, Alexa+ is, of course, not perfect. Most basic tasks like setting reminders, checking the weather and playing music all work reliably. But asking for specific songs or albums can sometimes go badly. Occasionally, Alexa wouldn’t be able to find a specific album I was looking for but it would play other songs by the artist; other times it would come up with completely unrelated music. This is an issue I’ve had with all assistants, but I was hoping Alexa+ might be smart enough to avoid getting too far off base.</p>
<p>I asked it to “play the latest release by the band Now, Now.” It’s an EP entitled <em>01</em> so I had a feeling Alexa might struggle with that. Sure enough, it said “sure, here’s new music from Now, Now” and played one of the songs from that release. Not bad, but not quite right. I then followed up and said “can you play this entire album?” That did not work. Instead, I ended up with the song “Ain’t it Funky Now” performed by legendary jazz guitarist and composer Grant Green. An outstanding recording, sure, but not remotely close to what I was looking for. Even asking “play the album ‘<em>01 EP</em>’ by the band Now, Now” got me Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later.” Sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worse than that were the times when Alexa+ just made things up. The Alexa app provides you with little suggestions for things to ask about, like “iconic music duets.” I tapped it, curious to see what it provided, and it pulled up a list of “iconic music duets that have left an indelible mark on the music industry.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among those was “Smells Like Teen Spirit” performed by the late Kurt Cobain and his wife Courtney Love. This happened? News to me! I followed up and asked for more details and got a response noting that “there isn’t a formal duet of ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit.’” Best I can tell, it popped up because Love sang some unused lyrics from the legendary song on an episode of the <em>60 Songs That Explain the ‘90s</em> podcast, back in 2023. This is a perfect example of the random inferences AI often draws, and it’s a good reminder that Alexa+, like all AI assistants, can make things up sometimes. This didn’t happen often, but it’s still something you’ll need to look out for.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="f473d30c-0480-456d-a379-433262f2b656">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>The Echo Dot Max more or less delivers on Amazon’s promises. It sounds better than smaller speakers like the Echo Dot or Pop, and it’s significantly cheaper than the Echo Studio. If you’re at all interested in music, it’s worth stepping up to the Dot Max over the standard Dot. Beyond just better audio, it’s also significantly newer (the Dot was last updated in 2022). Its more modern processor means it should have a longer lifespan than the standard Dot, making it a better option for people who are eager to try out Alexa+.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That freshly updated hardware is a reason to consider the Echo Dot Max over similarly priced speakers like the Nest Audio and HomePod Mini, both of which are five years old. And despite Alexa+ dealing with some growing pains, it’s a better option at this moment than the unproven Gemini for Home Google that is rolling out or the old, limited Siri that the HomePod Mini is still stuck with.</p>
<p>But the Echo Dot Max still feels like a bit of a missed opportunity to me. The old Echo sounded so good, and this speaker is just not as exciting in comparison. It’s a fine way to interact with Alexa+ and enjoy some tunes, I just wish it sounded a little bit better.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-seeks-65700-in-damages-163051523.html">lawsuit against <em>Palworld</em></a> just hit a snag. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has ordered a reexamination of a key Nintendo patent expected to be wielded in the case. <em>Games Fray</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">reports</a> that the office is reviewing the Switch maker&#39;s patent regarding &quot;summon subcharacter and let it fight in 1 of 2 modes.&quot; If we view Nintendo&#39;s <em>Palworld</em> lawsuit as a test bed for monopolizing game mechanics, the development can only be seen as a good thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several factors make the reexamination unusual. First, Nintendo&#39;s patent in question (No. 12,403,397) was just <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/10/nintendo-secures-us-patent-for-game-mechanics-that-summon-a-character-for-fights/">granted</a> in September. The review was personally ordered by newly sworn-in USPTO Director John A. Squires. The Trump appointee has historically sided with patent holders, making it <em>harder</em> to contest them. Stranger still, <em>Games Fray</em> says this may be the USPTO&#39;s first patent reexamination in over a decade.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/ed67aac0-b9a2-11f0-adb7-b48093cb59a6" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/ed67aac0-b9a2-11f0-adb7-b48093cb59a6" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Sheep with guns in the game Palworld." data-uuid="2cde53b0-8168-387d-971d-63853a1a0302"><figcaption><em>Palworld</em></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocketpair</div></figure>
<p>Those ingredients suggest widespread blowback may be the driving force. Although <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair is <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-seeks-65700-in-damages-163051523.html">Nintendo&#39;s immediate target</a>, it&#39;s easy to see the case opening a Pandora&#39;s box where developers fear using well-established game mechanics. Indie developers would be particularly vulnerable. The &quot;slippery slope&quot; commentary practically writes itself.</p>
<p>If Nintendo&#39;s patent is ultimately invalidated, we may be able to thank Konami. A 2002 patent application from the maker of Metal Gear and Castlevania was cited as prior art, casting doubt on Nintendo&#39;s claim. A separate Nintendo patent, published in 2020, was also listed as possible prior art. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/"><em>Games Fray</em>&#39;s report</a> dives much deeper into the legal weeds.</p>
<p>Nintendo now has two months to respond. During that period, third parties can come forward with additional prior art references. As a nervous industry eyes Nintendo&#39;s case as a potential test bed for monopolizing game mechanics, don&#39;t be shocked if gaming lawyers search far and wide for more examples.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-patent-on-summoning-fighting-npcs-is-being-reexamined-180949135.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stability AI has partially succeeded in defending itself against accusations of copyright infringement. As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/04/stabilty-ai-high-court-getty-images-copyright"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Stability AI prevailed in a high-profile UK High Court case, following Getty first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-sues-the-maker-of-ai-art-generator-stable-diffusion-over-data-scraping-allegations-184502897.html">suing</a> the company in 2023 for allegedly using its copyright images to train its Stable Diffusion AI art tool without permission.</p>
<p>Getty’s original claim was that Stability AI had unlawfully copied and processed millions of protected images for training purposes, therefore abusing the rights of the original creators. However, the Seattle-based company eventually withdrew its claims of primary copyright infringement as it reportedly could offer no evidence that unauthorized copying for the training of Stable Diffusion had taken place in the UK.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Today’s ruling concerns claims of secondary infringement, to which the High Court judge, Justice Joanna Smith, ruled that &quot;an AI model such as Stable Diffusion which does not store or reproduce any copyright works (and has never done so) is not an &#39;infringing copy&#39;&quot; under UK law. This was despite the ruling finding some evidence of Getty’s images being used by Stability, as evidenced by the presence of the former’s watermark. While the judge sided with Getty on some of its claims, she <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/getty-stability-ai-image-copyright-trademark-fa2c561a33c7b6714a7657255a3fbdf1">said</a> that the evidence was &quot;both historic and extremely limited in scope.&quot;</p>
<p>The High Court ruling likely won’t fill companies and creators concerned about AI-related copyright infringement with a huge amount of optimism, but unsurprisingly, both Getty and Stability AI have been quick to celebrate their respective victories. Getty&#39;s statement reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s ruling confirms that Stable Diffusion’s inclusion of Getty Images’ trademarks in AI‑generated outputs infringed those trademarks. Crucially, the Court rejected Stability AI’s attempt to hold the user responsible for that infringement, confirming that responsibility for the presence of such trademarks lies with the model provider, who has control over the images used to train the model. This is a significant win for intellectual property owners. The ruling delivered another key finding; that, wherever the training and development did take place, Getty Images&#39; copyright‑protected works were used to train Stable Diffusion. The ruling also established a powerful precedent that intangible articles, such as AI models, are subject to copyright infringement claims in the same way as tangible articles. We will be taking forward findings of fact from the UK ruling in our US case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company added that it was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; that even &quot;well-resourced companies&quot; remain at risk of infringement due to a &quot;lack of transparent requirements.&quot; It also urged the UK government to build on the current laws around this issue. Christian Dowell, general counsel to Stability AI, said the final ruling from the court &quot;ultimately resolves the copyright concerns that were the core issue.&quot;</p>
<p>The ruling comes just days after Getty <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-signs-deal-to-use-getty-images-152343900.html">announced</a> a new agreement with Perplexity AI that permits the latter to access Getty’s huge media library as part of its search and discovery tools. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-and-perplexity-strike-multi-year-image-partnership">press release</a>, Getty said a condition of the licensing deal was Perplexity committing to &quot;making improvements on how it displays imagery, including image credit with link to source, to better educate users on how to use licensed imagery legally.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/uk-high-court-sides-with-stability-ai-over-getty-in-copyright-case-180029461.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems Apple is preparing to debut a low-cost Mac laptop in the first half of 2026. According to <a><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, such a system is in early production at the company’s overseas suppliers and Apple is testing the devices internally.</p><p>Apple’s aim with this laptop, per the report, is to draw people away from the likes of Chromebooks and cheap Windows PCs and into its own ecosystem. The company is said to be making the system with casual users, students and businesses in mind — the kinds of folks who use laptops for tasks like web browsing, light media editing and working on documents. Apple is also reportedly planning to aim the system at potential iPad buyers who’d still rather have a traditional laptop.</p><p>The laptop is said to have a new design with a “lower-end LCD display” and it’s expected to run on an A-series iPhone processor that’s said to deliver better performance than the M1. It’s also likely to have a smaller display than the 13.6-inch MacBook Air. </p><p>Performance is important, but the price point will be crucial if Apple wants to really compete with the proliferation of Chromebooks and entry-level Windows devices.  The company is said to be ready to sell this Mac for “well under $1,000.” Chromebooks and Windows laptops often sell for just a few hundred bucks. Higher-end Chromebooks cost around $600, so Apple would likely have to sell this laptop for $700 or less for it to make a real splash.</p><p>Apple has traditionally focused on making premium devices, but would be a smart time for the company to enter the lower end of the market.
