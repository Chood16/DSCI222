That&#39;s because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they&#39;re planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we&#39;re keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung has already held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs. Presentations from NVIDIA, Sony, Lego, Hyundai and others are yet to come.</p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos that are being shown off at the event) right here. We&#39;ll be keeping this story updated throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="58d7743a-3001-4b75-a49d-5560b8baa777">Micro RGB TVs&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" style="height:1423px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&amp;#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV." data-uuid="0e796659-fedf-4a07-9718-5aab3d0b16da"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you&#39;re shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that&#39;s similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren&#39;t quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can&#39;t be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#39;re seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>.

This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.</p><p>LG revealed its first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Micro RGB set</a> at CES as well.

Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.</p><p>On the Google side of TV land, you can expect <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">more Gemini-powered features</a>. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months.</p><h2 id="3ac1d579-4b48-481d-bc1f-94fa0a6e1605">Samsung</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/69776940-e9f8-11f0-afca-02ae016f217d" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/69776940-e9f8-11f0-afca-02ae016f217d" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026." data-uuid="0dab8a2c-1810-31fd-a73f-1279914d4cd3"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs.

For everyone&quot; (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPdEMp1fOA4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>First Look has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company&#39;s fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that&#39;s said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you&#39;re not home.</p><h2 id="ea0b6a54-f846-4c76-a256-3ee71929ee2c">LG</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="LG&#39;s CLOiD robot." data-uuid="4f24430f-4e32-4bc7-a1ad-481a02508ce9"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s CLOiD robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>Likewise, LG brought other non-TV tech to CES.

This appears to be more of a concept than something you&#39;ll be able to buy anytime soon, but we should get a closer look at the CLOiD in person this week.</p><p>The company also debuted the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">LG Sound Suite</a>, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos.

You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then it&#39;s a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).</p><h2 id="c68f7780-1cd0-4b7b-94b7-7cb90e1cdac5">AI&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/59c6e9b0-e8dd-11f0-9d2e-c8c0e25cec4a" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/59c6e9b0-e8dd-11f0-9d2e-c8c0e25cec4a" style="height:1190px;width:2300px;" alt="Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers." data-uuid="a6353e8c-131b-3ff2-9564-a78750140d4a"/><figcaption>Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>No prizes for guessing that there&#39;s going to be a ton of AI-related news at CES this year.

It's already on sale for $30, which is a discount of $10. These are preorders, however, with shipments officially going out on January 20.</p> 
<p>The 45W charger includes a screen that displays real-time data like power flow, temperature and charging status. It also features "fun animations to keep things cheerful." Anker says it can recognize what's being charged and automatically adjust certain metrics to ensure a longer battery lifespan.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="1f0c9e1aa28c4e6cb8e2f5b6045a4e14" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.anker.com/products/a121d-45w-usb-c-fast-charger-foldable-plug-compact?variant=46070529228950"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> 
<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout. If that doesn't work, it's <strong>WS24D5XT3DV9</strong>. We haven't gotten a chance to try this one yet, but it looks promising.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-new-45w-charger-from-ces-is-already-10-off-160707324.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker&#39;s sub-brand Soundcore just announced a new AI voice recorder at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a>. The appropriately-named Work voice recorder is primarily intended for professionals, but also seems useful for students and anyone else who wants an AI to transcribe conversations.</p>
<p>To that end, the company promises 97-percent transcription accuracy via the AI algorithm. The affiliated app will also provide summaries of conversations, like many modern AI tools. Users can double-tap the gadget during important parts of a conversation to ensure it gets preferential treatment.</p>

<p>None of this is really that new. Dedicated AI voice recorders <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-13-baidu-ai-transcription.html"><ins>have been around a while</ins></a> and there are <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/read-ai-is-building-a-note-taking-app-that-works-nearly-anywhere-130000235.html"><ins>plenty of smartphone apps</ins></a> that do this kind of thing. The Soundcore Work, however, is extremely small and could make for an inconspicuous recording method. The company says it&#39;s &quot;coin-sized&quot; so it should fit just about anywhere, including as part of a necklace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has built-in privacy protections and has been MFi certified for Apple devices. The Soundcore Work is available right now and costs $159.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/ankers-soundcore-work-ai-voice-recorder-offers-transcription-in-an-ultra-compact-form-factor-160030844.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker, one of the leaders in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html"><ins>third-party chargers</ins></a>, has unveiled a new portfolio of &quot;smart&quot; chargers and docks at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a>. The company says the lineup adds improved visual interfaces, faster Qi2 wireless charging and &quot;upgraded ecosystems&quot; for the latest line of iPhone models.</p>
<p>First up is the Anker Nano Charger, which features a smart display, 180-degree foldable prongs and provides up to 45W of power. The plug can identify the exact iPhone model connected and then deliver the right amount of power for your phone. Anker says the Nano uses three-stage power delivery and a &quot;Care Mode&quot; that the company claims keeps batteries cooler than some competing 45W chargers. It arrives in late January 2026 and will retail for $40.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For fans of wireless charging stations, the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station offers a 3-in-1 solution for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. It uses a &quot;AirCool&quot; system for &quot;faster, safer performance&quot; and offers up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. The design is also foldable for compact travel. It&#39;s set for release in Q1 2026 and will retail for $150.</p>
<p>The company debuted a clamp-on 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip with 70W of output and built-in surge protection. It sports two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and six AC outlets. The Nano Power Strip is getting a late January release, and it will sell for $70.</p>
<p>Anker also unveiled a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station. This serves as an all-in-one hub with support for up to three displays (with 4K resolution supported on a single display), up to 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between connected devices. It also features a removable 6-in-1 hub with SD and microSD card readers, a USB-A port and a 5 Gbps USB-C port. The Nano Docking Station is available now and retails for $150.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-unveils-a-new-lineup-of-chargers-and-docks-at-ces-2026-160021195.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker&#39;s sub-brand Eufy just revealed a high-tech baby bottle washer at CES 2026. The Bottle Washer S1 is filled to the brim with nifty features that should please frazzled parents.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been designed to clean deeper than rival models. The Bottle Washer S1 features a built-in water softener, a first in the product category, which should help remove stubborn minerals. It also includes proprietary HydroBlast technology that cleans baby bottles from every angle. This is assisted by the inclusion of a multi-layer rotating spray.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sterilizes up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and dries in just 40 minutes. These are both fantastic metrics for baby bottle washers. It also holds more bottles than comparable units, with the ability to clean eight bottle sets at once.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/0e8258a0-e0f8-11f0-bffb-734acfb33b9b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/0e8258a0-e0f8-11f0-bffb-734acfb33b9b" style="height:580px;width:800px;" alt="A bottle washer and bottle sets." data-uuid="55652b91-a7dc-3204-b02f-6cca1b7ffd65"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker/Eufy </div></figure>
<p>The device allows for complete app control, which lets users set cleaning schedules and perform simple maintenance routines. After cleaning, it can keep bottle sets in a sterile standby mode for up to 72 hours. This really looks like the best bottle washer out there, but quality comes at a price. We don&#39;t have any details yet regarding pricing or availability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eufy also announced a portable milk cooler at CES. This should be another boon for busy parents.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/eufy-just-revealed-a-tech-heavy-baby-bottle-washer-at-ces-160021666.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Anker affiliate just unveiled the 1080p Nebula P1i portable projector that's less than half the price and even more portable, albeit with less brightness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of detachable speakers like the Nebula P1, the P1i's speakers are embedded in the projector and can be flipped open and tilted through 180 degrees. It also lacks the P1's tilting projector body and instead offers a stand that can incline the projector from zero to 12 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though it offers the same 1080p maximum resolution as the Nebula P1, it's a bit less bright at 400 instead of 650 ANSI Lumens. Like the more expensive model, though, it supports autofocus, auto keystone correction and screen fit, which will make setup easy for spontaneous outdoor use. And like other projectors in the Nebula lineup, it supports Google TV so you can stream Netflix, Prime Video, Disney and other apps. Best of all, the Nebula P1i is priced at a very reasonable $369 and is set to arrive in "early 2026," according to Soundcore.&nbsp;</p>

As a reminder, the projector delivers 3,500 ANSI lumens and an impressive 110 percent coverage of the Rec.2020 HDR color space. The sound system, meanwhile, features a floating subwoofer, 80W soundbar speakers and two wireless satellite speakers for 7.1.4 surround sound. It even supports Dolby Atmos, which the projector on its own doesn't do, while offering IP43 protection from light rain and dust if you want to use it outdoors.</p>

That change, plus tweaks to the tips of the Pro, seem to be how Anker is offering ANC on the new earbuds. Anker says the algorithm running on the Pro checks 380,000 times per second to adjust its level of noise cancellation on the fly. The earbuds&#39; custom diaphragms also offer deeper bass and clearer highs, according to the company.</p>

<p>Alongside new open-ear earbuds, Anker is also introducing a new portable Bluetooth speaker. The Soundcore Boom Go 3i is a palm-sized speaker with a strap that&#39;s ideal for attaching to a bag or taking on a camping trip. Anker says the 15W speaker gets 22 hours of battery life, and that the Boom Go 3i&#39;s 4,800mAh battery can be used to charge other devices in an emergency. With an IP68 rating, the speaker also has ample dust and water protection.</p>

<p>Anker says the Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro will be available in February for $179.99. Final pricing for the Soundcore Boom Go 3i wasn&#39;t shared by Anker, but the company says the speaker will be priced between $65-$80 and will go on sale in March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ankers-new-aerofit-2-earbuds-can-switch-between-open-ear-and-anc-form-factors-160014977.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>8BitDo just revealed a new gamepad at CES and it&#39;s a doozy. The Ultimate 3E Controller for XBox is a modular marvel that should suit just about any configuration preference. That&#39;s because many elements are swappable.</p>
<p>There are two different button modules, each with a different feel when pressing down. There are several joystick options, including standard, tall and thick-neck designs. The controller even ships with a pair of D-pad options. One is intended for precision and the other for &quot;smooth, directional rolls.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/a1d86a40-df5e-11f0-bf77-0b3c7dd18e7e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/a1d86a40-df5e-11f0-bf77-0b3c7dd18e7e" style="height:606px;width:907px;" alt="Thumbsticks." data-uuid="3dfecae9-1c24-3be7-9fef-29c836c20a82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">8BitDo</div></figure>
<p>There are other bells and whistles here. The Ultimate 3E offers a 1000Hz max polling rate, hall-effect impulse triggers, remappable bumpers that have been designed for speed and customizable 6-axis motion control. It also ships with a wireless charging case. This thing is a beast.</p>
<p>Despite being officially licensed by Xbox, the controller works with other platforms. It looks like a great option for PC, Android and Apple devices.</p>
<p>Now for the bad news. These pro-level features come with a pro-level price tag. The Ultimate 3E costs $150. The company says preorders will open up in the near future and that it should ship later in the year. In the meantime, you&#39;ll have to make due with this nifty <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-all-button-arcade-controller-is-almost-as-thin-as-a-macbook-pro-161712267.html">arcade-style controller</a> by 8BitDo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-ultimate-3e-gamepad-for-xbox-offers-swappable-button-modules-and-joysticks-160011248.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like only a few years ago that Anker made nothing more than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-anker-laptop-power-bank-soothed-my-self-inflicted-battery-anxiety-123000024.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">batteries</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-announces-new-140w-wall-charger-with-a-handy-built-in-display-at-ces-2025-030027200.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">chargers</a>. But 15 years into its history, the company&#39;s CES portfolio continues to illustrate how much it&#39;s expanded. Among other announcements, the company has a new robot vacuum, video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. They&#39;re all rolling out under Anker&#39;s Eufy smart home brand.</p><p>The company hopes its Eufy Clean Robot Vacuum Omni S2 will be your next robovac. The $1,600 device vacuums with 100 AW suction, and it mops, too. Anker claims the vac works on shag carpets up to about 2 inches (5 cm) in pile height. It has an 11.4-inch rolling mop that applies up to 15 N of downward pressure.</p><p>As is increasingly common in robovacs, Omni S2 uses AI to identify floor types and adjust several factors on the fly. These include cleaning mode, suction, scrubbing force and wheel height. The machine can also generate lightly oxidizing disinfectants (a hypochlorous acid and ozone water solution) inside its tank.</p><p>Presales for the Eufy Clean Robot Vacuum Omni S2 begin on January 6. Shipping and in-store availability for the $1,600 robovac kicks off on January 20.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_2.jpg" style="height:1791px;width:3184px;" alt="A person reaching their finger to touch a smart doorbell" data-uuid="a5582f97-afa5-4b18-8910-c8b82aa106c1"/><figcaption>Eufy Video Doorbell S4</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker</div></figure><p>Anker also has a new doorbell, the Eufy Video Doorbell S4. It includes an AI-powered people detection feature with auto-framing. The doorbell has 3,024 x 3,024 resolution at 24 FPS and offers a panoramic (180 x 180-degree) view.</p><p>You can use the doorbell in either wired or wireless mode, and it supports solar charging. The Video Doorbell S4 is scheduled to launch &quot;later in Q1&quot; for $280.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eufy_Solar_Wall_Light_Cam_S4_Lifestyle_Image_2.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eufy_Solar_Wall_Light_Cam_S4_Lifestyle_Image_2.png" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Product lifestyle photo of a solar-powered smart light mounted on an outdoor wall of a home" data-uuid="9da19c6f-b524-4c92-81cb-15b84cc1636a"/><figcaption>Eufy Solar Wall Light Cam S4</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker</div></figure><p>Along similar lines, there&#39;s the Solar Wall Light Cam S4. The outdoor light has a built-in 4K camera with an f/1.6 aperture. The light has a color temperature ranging from warm white (2700K) to cool white (6500K).</p><p>As its name suggests, it supports solar charging. It’s bundled with a detachable 2W solar panel. It also has a 10,000mAh battery that&#39;s rated for up to two months. Anker says the Solar Wall Light Cam S4 will arrive in Q1 for $200.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_3.jpg" style="height:4483px;width:7969px;" alt="Product lifestyle photo of a mother and daughter using a mounted smart lock.

It has &quot;advanced 3D face recognition&quot; that can identify you and your family from up to 10 feet away, unlocking accordingly. Its camera has 2K resolution and a 135-degree field of view, which should capture visitors from head to toe. The lock has a removable 15,000mAh battery (rated for six months) and a smaller 800mAh backup battery to keep things running while the main one is charging.</p><p>The Smart Lock E40 supports Matter, Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home Assistant and Samsung SmartThings. It&#39;s expected to launch in Q1 at Home Depot (online and in stores) for $300.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ankers-ces-smart-home-lineup-includes-a-1600-eufy-robovac-160000133.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JLab, known for quality consumer audio that doesn&#39;t break the bank, is diving further into gaming. At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company has new keyboards, mice and headsets aimed at gamers. Sticking with the brand&#39;s &quot;bang for your buck&quot; angle, they&#39;re available in three reasonably priced tiers.</p><p>The entry-level tier adopts the Nightfall brand name, which JLab already used on its 2023 gaming headphones. (They&#39;re still available and now come in pink and white colors, alongside the preexisting black.) Joining them is a $40 &quot;ultra-light&quot; mouse that weighs 53g. Also costing $40 is a Nightfall keyboard that the company claims has &quot;unmatched precision and accuracy for its price.&quot; Its specs include a 52±7 gram-force actuation and a 2.4mm key travel distance.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jlabs_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jlabs_2.jpg" style="height:2274px;width:3789px;" alt="A keyboard, mouse and gaming headset" data-uuid="069b2486-3bbc-4df3-8081-0ece5528ce0f"><figcaption>JLab&#39;s Midnight tier</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLabs</div></figure><p>JLab’s mid-range suite is called Midnight. In that tier, you&#39;ll find a $100 mechanical tenkeyless keyboard with N-key rollover, anti-ghosting, and a media dial. You&#39;ll also find the $70 Midnight mouse with a 1,000Hz polling rate. And there&#39;s a $100 wireless gaming headset with 50mm drivers and an estimated 70+ hours of battery life.</p><p>Finally, there&#39;s the premium (but still reasonably affordable) Daybreak tier. This segment&#39;s mouse costs $100 and offers &quot;true 1:1 tracking&quot; with a PAW3395 sensor. Meanwhile, the $150 Daybreak keyboard is a mechanical tenkeyless model with magnetic keys and a built-in palm rest.

You can pick up the smartwatch for $300, which is 25 percent off its regular price, a discount of $100. Discounts tend to increase as we get closer to September, when the next generation of Apple Watch is typically announced.</p>
<p>The Series 11 is our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html"><ins>best overall smartwatch</ins></a> pick, and we gave it a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html"><ins>hands-on review</ins></a>. We were impressed with the battery life, which lasted longer than the 24 hours it&#39;s rated for in our testing. We also liked how lightweight and thin the watch is. The 9.7mm thick case on the Series 11 ties the Series 10 for the thinnest Apple Watch so far.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fitness and health tracking are the main appeals of an Apple Watch, and the Series 11 introduces sleep tracking and hypertension notifications. The sleep tracking was comfortable thanks to the watch&#39;s small form factor. The watch also added a new wrist flick gesture that lets you dismiss notifications, end calls and silence alarms or timers.</p>
<p>The GPS + cellular model of the Series 11 is also $100 off, and it&#39;s the first Apple Watch to support 5G networks. It&#39;s not too often you see an Apple product for 25 percent off its retail price, so if you were in the market for a smart watch, and especially if you are an iPhone user, it&#39;s worth checking out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-apple-watch-series-11-is-at-the-lowest-price-weve-ever-seen-154609747.html?src=rss]]></description>

So what&#39;s in store for this year&#39;s show? New leadership, for starters.</p>
<p>The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-to-appoint-james-fishler-to-c-suite-as-the-company-strengthens-its-u-s-strategy-ahead-o">press release</a>, Hisense said Fishler&#39;s experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company &quot;builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.&quot;</p>

<p>With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand.

</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">Samsung</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">LG</a> have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might think of Bosch as the modern European equivalent to what the GE brand once was in America. It&#39;s a home appliance name (thanks to its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational brand&#39;s core business is really about providing the underlying technology and engineering that powers cars, homes and factories around the world. That focus is reflected at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html">CES 2026</a>, where much of what Bosch is unveiling is intended to be licensed to other companies rather than sold as Bosch-branded products on store shelves.</p>
<p>Case in point is Bosch&#39;s automotive plans at CES. The company is showcasing what it calls &quot;AI in the car,&quot; or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. &quot;Bosch&#39;s AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants,&quot; Bosch board member Markus Heyn <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ai-in-the-car-bosch-presents-cockpit-innovations-at-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-280272.html">said in a press release</a>. We&#39;ll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-boschs-ces-2026-presentation">How to watch Bosch&#39;s CES 2026 presentation</h2>
<p>You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ces-2026-livestream.html">Bosch press page</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzDeUHM8eik">YouTube</a>. (We&#39;ve embedded the stream link below.)</p>

<p id="jump-link-what-to-expect">We&#39;ll also be highlighting any relevant info from Bosch&#39;s presentation in the main Engadget CES 2026 liveblog.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/ces-2026/#what-to-expect">three big themes</a> — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.</p>
<p>Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &quot;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html">CES 2026</a> kicked off with a big press conference from one of the biggest companies at the show: Samsung. The tech giant held its &quot;first look&quot; presentation to show off new home products and make a plethora of AI-infused announcements. New TVs, speakers, projectors and more were among the headliners, along with updated gaming monitors and soundbars.</p>
<p>Many of the products announced on stage were not actually new, but instead had been dripped out by Samsung recently. Like its minimalist Music Studio speakers or new Micro RGB TVs. We did get a closer look a previously undisclosed set, a flagship 130-inch Micro RGB TV framed by a giant metal easel with embedded speakers. It&#39;s one of the most striking sets we&#39;ve ever seen, but it&#39;s much more in the realm of concept than reality. (That&#39;s not to say they won&#39;t sell it, just that we&#39;ve heard no plans and if they do it will be hideously expensive.)</p>

<p>As for the rest of Samsung&#39;s Micro RGB TV line, that may actually be slightly more affordable. The company released its first set last year for an eye-watering $30,000, but that was a 115-inch proof of concept. This year it&#39;ll be <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">offering TVs in more reasonable sizes</a>, including the ever-popular 55-, 65- and 75-inch sets. We don&#39;t know pricing on those but those smaller models will definitely be cheaper than $30,000. For those that want something bigger, there&#39;ll also be 85-, 100- and 115-inch models. As before, the Micro RGB range will offer a purported 100% coverage of the Rec.2020 color space, which is something that even the highest-end OLEDs can&#39;t match.</p>
<p>While they may have been announced prior to CES, we did get <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html">a few minutes in person with Samsung&#39;s Music Studio speakers</a> in the demo area after the big show. The Music Studio 5 and 7 are wireles speakers supporting both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, while the Studio 7 has a 3.1.1 setup with top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers to give an &quot;immersive 3D audio experience.&quot; For all of that, it&#39;s clear the main draw of these new speakers is the design, which is definitely striking.</p>
<p>Another thing from those heady pre-CES days was the Freestyle+, the latest attempt at a micro projector from Samsung. Like previous Freestyle models, it&#39;s small and unobtrusive, but this one is a little brighter and has &quot;smarter AI capabilities.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Freestyle+ reflects Samsung’s vision to create displays that adapt naturally to how people live and move between spaces,” said Hun Lee, Executive Vice President of the Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “By combining true portability with intelligent AI that optimizes both the viewing environment and the content itself, The Freestyle+ makes it easier to enjoy a consistent, high-quality experience wherever you are.”</p>

<p>There were even products that Samsung didn&#39;t mention on stage that we then found in the demo area. Like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html">Samsung HW-QS90H soundbar</a>, a new skew on its popular HW-QS90 line that targets those of us that would rather not have a subwoofer sitting in our living rooms. It&#39;s an all-in-one 7.1.2 soundbar with 13 drivers, including four (we&#39;re assuming) woofers for its &quot;Quad Bass Woofer system.&quot; Or the&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was really that for the big announcements. The rest of the stage show was focused on how Samsung thinks (or really, at this point, insists) AI is going to make all of its products more useful. Demos included using AI noise cancelling to turn off the commentators in a soccer match, using AI to watch recipes on your fridge door, using AI to wash your clothes better (?) and... to cut a long story short, Samsung would very much appreciate it if you could please use AI.</p>
<p>We&#39;re expecting to see and hear more from Samsung during CES, but for now you can find all of our news stories and more detailed hands-on impressions below, or if you want to relieve the event in extruciating detail there&#39;s the livestream replay too. (Don&#39;t worry, though the video is three hours long the event itself  was a tight hour.)</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bee, the company behind an always-listening AI wearable that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-acquiring-an-ai-wearable-that-listens-to-everything-you-do-221103233.html"><ins>Amazon acquired last year</ins></a>, has announced new features in a status update. The device is designed to run in the background of daily life and captures conversations or thoughts spoken aloud. Recording can be started or stopped with the push of a button.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Bee, Maria de Lourdes Zollo, says the company has shipped four major updates that will run on the existing Bee Pioneer hardware. The first is “Actions,” which connects Bee to a user&#39;s email and calendar and works to turn spoken commitments into actions. The company says that when you say you need to send an e-mail, for instance, Bee can draft one for you.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Daily Insights” is designed to identify patterns and trends based on information collected over weeks or months. The company says the goal of this feature is to notice things before a user might, including &quot;shifts in your relationships&quot; and recommend personalized goals related to these, like a life coach of sorts.</p>
<p>“Voice Notes” lets a user press the record button on Bee and log a fleeting thought, a task for a to-do list or anything else that a user wants to recall later. Finally, &quot;Templates&quot; is designed to organize and summarize large amounts of information into a more digestible format. It can also create a study plan from a lecture or recap a sales meeting with a client.</p>
<p>Most of these features would presumably be more useful if a user sets their Bee to record constantly, which raises questions around legality and privacy. Zollo says that Bee processes audio in real time so no audio is ever stored, adding that neither Bee nor Amazon ever have access to transcripts. Still, the wearable could come up against recording consent laws which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.justia.com/50-state-surveys/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations/"><ins>vary by jurisdiction</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/bee-has-been-busy-since-its-acquisition-by-amazon-last-year-150025311.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon just revealed the Ember Artline TV at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html">CES 2026</a>. This is a lifestyle TV that displays art, putting it in direct competition with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">Samsung&#39;s The Frame</a>. The 4K QLED screen is extremely thin, at 1.5-inches, so it&#39;ll likely fit just about anywhere.</p>
<p>It also features a glare-reducing matte screen that has been &quot;designed to make your art and photos look great.&quot; The Artline integrates with Amazon Photos and offers access to 2,000 pieces of free art to display. For those worried about electricity usage, the TV includes proprietary technology that senses when someone has entered or left the room and turns on or off accordingly.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The display comes with Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">new smart assistant Alexa+</a>, allowing it to double as a smart TV. This is helped along by the inclusion of far-field microphones. Alexa+ is a beefier version of the company&#39;s long-standing digital assistant. You can talk to it like a person, if that&#39;s your bag. There&#39;s even a new use case in which Alexa+ analyzes the aesthetics of a room and recommends art to throw on the screen.</p>

<p>This is also a standard TV. It features support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6 and will operate on the Fire TV platform. Customers can choose from 10 magnetic frames in a wide variety of colorways, further diversifying the aesthetics.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have a release date yet, other than &quot;later this spring.&quot; Amazon has released pricing, however, as this TV starts at $899 for the 55-inch version.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ember-artline-is-amazons-answer-to-samsungs-the-frame-150015104.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is kicking off the new year by announcing a redesign of its Fire TV UI at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>. The new UI is designed to make finding things to watch on the platform faster, while making it easier to access more of Fire TV&#39;s features straight from the home screen.</p><p>On first blush, the biggest difference in the new Fire TV UI is that everything is rounder. Shows, movies and apps have rounded corners, and Amazon&#39;s changed the spacing in the interface to give everything more room to breathe. Tweaks to typography and color gradients also give the UI a more modern feel, and Amazon says it&#39;s rebuilt the code of the Fire TV software to make everything faster, too, in some cases demonstrating &quot;up to 20-30 percent gains in speed.&quot;</p><p>The fundamentals haven&#39;t changed all that much, however. There&#39;s a menu bar of different tabs at the top of the interface that separates the Home page from things like Movies, TV Shows and Sports. Each page shows content in carousels, and Amazon still lets you pin streaming apps like Netflix or Apple TV underneath recommended content, with the biggest difference being you can now pin more apps at once (20 rather than six). Amazon is also changing up how the Fire TV Remote works. Pressing the Menu button now lets you quickly access Fire TV&#39;s Art &amp; Photos, Games and Ambient Experience features, and a long press of the Home button pulls up a shortcut panel with access to things like settings and connected Ring cameras. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Alexa+</a>, Amazon&#39;s rebuilt AI assistant, is also available directly inside of the Fire TV interface for adding things to your watchlist, recommending content and controlling your smart home.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Fire-TV-mobile-app.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Fire-TV-mobile-app.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The redesigned Fire TV mobile app with access to content and browsing watchlists." data-uuid="5afe480c-fe8a-42f4-bd35-96401e6a6de8"/><figcaption>The new Fire TV mobile app can act as a remote and a way to search Amazon&#39;s library of content.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon offers the Fire TV mobile app as a way to control its streaming devices and TVs with a smartphone, but alongside this redesign, the company is also expanding what the app can do. The new Fire TV app lets you browse content, edit your watchlist and start playing things on your TV, in much the same way Roku and Google&#39;s streaming apps do.</p><p>Both the new Fire TV mobile app and redesigned Fire TV UI will be available for free for all users, Amazon says. The new Fire TV UI will launch in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, the second-generation Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED series. Later in the spring, Amazon says it will bring the redesign to more countries and devices, including the latest Fire TV 4K streaming devices, TVs like the Fire TV 2-series, 4-series and Fire TV Omni QLED series and TVs from third-party partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic and TCL.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/amazon-is-redesigning-its-fire-tv-ui-for-streaming-sticks-and-tvs-150000622.html?src=rss]]></description>

While not as expensive as an iPad or another flagship tablet, these e-paper devices can be more expensive than you think, but right now you can save on one of our favorites. Amazon&#39;s base <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0CNVCQZG1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e9865d5d-82c0-47b4-858f-2d61df88bf8c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FtYXpvbi1LaW5kbGUvZHAvQjBDTlZDUVpHMT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlOTg2NWQ1ZC04MmMwLTQ3YjQtODU4Zi0yZDYxZGY4OGJmOGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vQW1hem9uLUtpbmRsZS9kcC9CMENOVkNRWkcxIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARwL4yr9OWUmLZ8hMMGdyB_Y6VDLKvXaTHkB9-pMzWND&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Kindle%2Fdp%2FB0CNVCQZG1" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1">Kindle</a> is on sale for $90 — that&#39;s $20 less than usual and only $10 more than its record-low price.</p> 
<p>This made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html">best ereaders</a>, and for good reason. It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="feed13a4ff304bf1a5611d4015f6cd38" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>

As has become tradition, the pre-show slate set the tone for the week ahead, anchored by Samsung’s annual First Look press conference and CES Unveiled, the latter of which where hundreds of companies previewed products before the show floor opens on January 6.</p><p>Samsung once again dominated the early conversation with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-the-biggest-announcements-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059466.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">First Look event</a>, using the stage to outline how it sees AI shaping everything from TVs to home appliances in the year ahead. Rather than focusing on individual specs, Samsung framed its 2026 lineup around adaptive experiences, with screens and devices designed to respond more intelligently to their environment and the people using them. TVs  remained the centerpiece, with updates like the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB model</a> aimed at improving picture quality, content discovery and personalization through AI-driven tools.</p><p>Among the more concrete pieces of tech tied to Samsung’s CES run was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">The Freestyle+</a>, a successor to the company’s portable projector that doubles down on AI-powered picture optimization, brighter output and smarter calibration for different surfaces.

The company further bolstered its audio portfolio with the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Music Studio wireless speakers</a>, which offer an eye-catching design.</p><p>Samsung’s broader display strategy was also on show: Samsung Display revealed next-generation QD-OLED panels capable of peak brightness up to 4,500 nits, which are expected to be used in TVs and monitors that debut on the show floor, and introduced new concepts illustrating how OLED tech can blend into future AI-enhanced lifestyles.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c3537010-e9f5-11f0-bdef-1bc2c48a4dbd" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c3537010-e9f5-11f0-bdef-1bc2c48a4dbd" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="undefined" data-uuid="6b7081c9-5c32-3369-bf28-36b5d3dad8b1"/><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Software also played a role in Samsung’s early messaging. The company confirmed that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Google Photos will be coming to Samsung TVs</a> later this year, bringing photo libraries and Memories directly into the living room. It’s the kind of addition that doesn’t grab headlines in the same way as new hardware, but it’s exactly the type of update that quietly shapes how people actually use their TVs regularly.</p><p>Outside of Samsung’s event, CES Unveiled — the convention’s kickoff mini-show — offered an early look at what smaller companies and startups are bringing to Las Vegas this year. The show floor was packed with a familiar mix of near-ready consumer products and more experimental ideas, spanning robotics, smart home gear, health tech and personal electronics. Companion-style robots, updated AR glasses and AI-powered household gadgets were common sights, reflecting broader trends that are likely to show up repeatedly across the main halls this week.</p><p>Unveiled is rarely about big-name launches, but it often reveals where the industry’s attention is drifting. This year, that meant a noticeable emphasis on AI-assisted hardware that blends into everyday routines, whether that’s home devices designed to act more autonomously or personal tech that prioritizes context and convenience over raw performance.</p><p>LG also kicked off its pre-show efforts with some notable display news that’s certain to shape conversations on the CES floor. The company reintroduced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ultra-thin Wallpaper OLED evo W6 TV</a>, a panel that sits just 9mm deep and can be mounted flush against a wall, boasting improvements in brightness and color accuracy with Hyper Radiant Color Technology and support for FreeSync and G-Sync.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" style="height:1327px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV" data-uuid="c57ab13f-a9b0-4a6e-b9be-88d620777eda"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>LG’s display lineup extends into the PC space too, where the division plans to debut a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">27-inch OLED gaming panel</a> hitting a 720Hz refresh rate and response times as low as 0.02 ms. On the lifestyle front, the Gallery TV aims to compete more directly with Samsung’s art-style screens by combining a specialized anti-glare panel with an expanding Gallery+ service that brings thousands of artworks to the living room.</p><p>Some CES-related announcements also landed ahead of Sunday, underscoring how stretched the show’s news cycle has become. Samsung and LG both shared display and ecosystem updates in the days leading up to January 4, ensuring their products were already part of the CES conversation before pre-show events even began.</p><p>Sunday’s announcements served as a clear warm-up for what’s coming next. Monday, January 5, marks the start of press day, when major companies will take the stage for individual conferences and a large number of embargoes are expected to lift. Then, on Tuesday, January 6, CES officially opens its doors, shifting the focus from presentations to hands-on demos and real-world impressions.</p><p>We’ll be updating <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">this recap</a> as more news breaks, but if Sunday was any indication, CES 2026 is already moving fast — and the show hasn’t even started yet.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ces-2026-opening-night-recap-all-the-early-news-you-missed-from-samsung-and-lg-142611832.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Lego Group is set to host its very first press conference at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">CES 2026</a> later today — but exactly what it plans to unveil is still under wraps. The iconic toy brick maker has offered no clues about what&#39;s on the agenda, leaving speculation wide open, from new video games to Formula 1 race cars.</p>
<p>Unlike nearly every other press event at CES today, however, Lego&#39;s event is not being livestreamed. Thankfully, Engadget is here to bridge the gap: Our own Nate Ingraham will be in the room at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, liveblogging the event in real-time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lego CES press conference is scheduled for Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET (10AM PT). We have confirmed with Lego reps that this event will not be officially livestreamed, so we&#39;re sharing our real-time impressions right here. Our stream starts at noon ET, an hour before the official event.</p>

<p>Thus far, Lego hasn&#39;t shared any public info about its CES plans, so we&#39;re largely in the dark as to what to expect.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is working even more Gemini features into Google TV at CES 2026. The company demoed how the AI assistant would work on its TV platform <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/gemini-ai-is-coming-to-google-tv-devices-in-2025-making-them-easier-to-talk-to-160003805.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">at last year&#39;s show</a>, and this time, it&#39;s expanding the AI&#39;s features to make it easier to do things like adjust your TV&#39;s settings or edit photos.</p><p>The ability to view photos stored in Google Photos has long been a feature of Google TV, but as part of this new update, Gemini will be able to do a lot more with them, too. Google says Gemini will be able to search your Google Photos library for specific people and moments, and remix those photos into different styles or compile them into a custom slideshow. Using Google&#39;s Veo and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Nano Banana</a> models, you&#39;ll also be able to ask Gemini to create entirely new media from scratch.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Device_Controls.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Device_Controls.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Gemini adjust picture settings through Google TV." data-uuid="fc31e661-e9ae-4d78-bbb1-3adc6a4d5e0a"/><figcaption>Gemini can adjust TV settings as part of the new update.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>When you don&#39;t want to spend time digging through menus, Google says Gemini will also be able to adjust picture and sound settings for you based on a natural language request. Rather than asking for your brightness to be set to a specific level, simply telling Gemini that &quot;the screen is too dim&quot; will be enough to prompt the AI to adjust the image. Gemini&#39;s ability to display information and answer questions through your TV is also expanding. The AI will now use a TV-friendly, &quot;visually rich framework&quot; to answer questions and explain topics, pulling on high-resolution images and video. When you need even more information, clicking on &quot;Dive deeper&quot; under a Gemini response will prompt the AI to create &quot;narrated, interactive overviews&quot; of whatever you want to learn more about.</p><p>Google only <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-for-tv-is-rolling-out-to-the-google-tv-streamer-220448361.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">recently rolled out Gemini</a> to its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/google-tv-streamer-review-a-great-side-piece-for-your-tv-with-a-dash-of-smart-home-chops-and-inessential-ai-160034550.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Google TV Streamer</a>, and it sounds like it could be a bit before these new features are widely available. Google says the new Gemini update will arrive on TCL TVs running Google TV first, before rolling out to &quot;other Google TV devices over the coming months.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html?src=rss]]></description>

In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384"><ins>post on X</ins></a>, the company says the 8BitDo FlipPad will debut in the summer of 2026 and will be compatible with iOS and Android devices. It also mentions the peripheral is &quot;officially supported by Apple.&quot;</p>
<p>The post doesn&#39;t give too much away, as the company will be premiering the FlipPad at CES this week. A short, rendered video shows that the mobile gaming peripheral connects via USB-C, and then flips upward on a hinge to lay flat against the bottom portion of a user&#39;s phone screen. In the rendering, we can see a directional pad, purple ABXY buttons, select, start buttons and six more unlabeled buttons.</p>

Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D54JZTHY&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=24b60c33-f851-4bee-9d8b-9c00c8cc034a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=AirTags&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRiNjBjMzMtZjg1MS00YmVlLTlkOGItOWMwMGM4Y2MwMzRhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR-tHxD_n-S9V6FZTggBPzQxNCDZMIugRbDnHNS6azZ_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?">AirTags</a> for $65.

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JBL just revealed a bunch of new earbuds at CES 2026, suiting just about every ear canal out there. First up, there are several new additions to the Endurance line of sports-adjacent earbuds.</p>
<p>The baddest of the bunch is likely the Endurance Zone, which offers 32 hours of battery life and fast charging. They include the company&#39;s proprietary OpenSound technology, which directs audio signals to the ears without blocking the ear canal. This means that wearers should be able to detect ambient noise during a workout. This is extremely helpful when someone is asking to use the machine because you&#39;ve been staring at your phone instead of doing reps.</p>

<p>The Zone earbuds also offer multipoint connections, earhooks for stability and an exterior designed for long-term durability. These buds cost $180 and will be available later this month.</p>
<p>The Endurance Peak 4 earbuds don&#39;t integrate with OpenSound, but do offer superior battery life to the Zone. They can get up to 48 hours per charge, when factoring in the included charging case. They cost $130 and will also be purchasable later in January.</p>

<p>The Endurance Pace wraparound earbuds are a fairly budget-friendly way to get access to that OpenSound tech. They cost just $90, but the battery maxes out at 10 hours, as there&#39;s no charging case. Look for these later this month.</p>
<p>The Endurance Run 3 are extremely budget-friendly earbuds, with prices ranging from $25 to $35. These are wired devices, with a USB-C model and a 3.5mm model. They&#39;ll be available in February.</p>
<p>The JBL Sense Pro also includes OpenSound and can play spatial content. The battery and case lasts up to 38 hours and there&#39;s wireless charging. These are designed for hi-fi audio, so they include redesigned drivers and a bass boosting algorithm. There are four integrated microphones for making calls. These earbuds cost $200, with availability in March.</p>

<p>The JBL Sense Lite earbuds, as the name suggests, are extremely light and made to be worn all day. They include OpenSound tech, 32 hours of battery life and touch controls. These buds will also be available in March, with a price of $150.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the Soundgear Clips. As the name suggests, these lightweight earbuds clip to the ears. They also use the company&#39;s OpenSound air-conduction technology. The earbuds are fairly striking, with a metallic tint and translucent finish. The battery life clocks in at 32 hours and can do fast charging. They cost $150 and will also go on sale this March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-just-announced-a-bunch-of-new-earbuds-at-ces-130044239.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For CES this year, JBL has added three new gaming headsets to its JBL Quantum product lineup. JBL Quantum 950X is the latest set of flagship headphones from the brand, with 50mm carbon dynamic drivers and features such as spatial audio, 3D head tracking and active noise cancelation. The set is compatible with PC, consoles and mobile platforms through 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 5.3 or wired connection. The 950X has a pair of hot-swappable and rechargeable batteries that give 50 hours of playtime. It comes with a 6mm cardioid boom microphone that uses AI noise reduction to keep background sounds out of in-game communication. The headset will retail for $400 and will be available starting in April 2026.</p><p>The other two new products are the JBL Quantum 650X and the JBL Quantum 250. The wireless 650X also has 50mm carbon dynamic drivers, spatial sound and the same connectivity options as the 950X. It has an expected battery life of 45 hours. The less expensive 650X will also be available in April and will retail for $200. The JBL Quantum 250 is a wired headset with many of the same drivers and features as the other two products. It has black and white model options, and will cost $80. This third model will be available starting March 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-launches-a-trio-of-gaming-headsets-for-ces-130000929.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s not the first of its kind, but a few key differences set Fraimic apart from other E Ink art displays. Aura, Switchbot and others have something similar. But unlike other versions, this one requires no subscription, lets you swap out the surrounding frame and doesn’t require an app to upload the art. Instead, a built-in mic picks up your idea, sends it to OpenAI and creates an image that pops up in a few moments on the screen. The on-board accelerometer even knows whether the device is in landscape or portrait orientation, and applies the correct format.</p>
<p>A purchase of the Fraimic comes with 100 free AI creations per year, and if that’s not enough, you can buy more. But if, like me, you don’t consider the images a machine’s brain smashes together to actually be art, the Fraimic also allows you to upload your own images via the brand’s website. And should that website ever go away, your device isn’t obsolete, as it can also handle local uploads. </p>

<p>The other qualities that make E Ink displays intriguing are all here. These screens are similar to what you get with a color <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ereader</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">E Ink tablet</a> and, like those devices, only require power when changing what’s displayed. This one has enough juice to last for years — even if you swap out the image once per day. </p>
<p>It uses a 13-inch <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Spectra6" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Spectra 6</a> E Ink display, which has a resolution of about 200 dots per inch. If you’ve seen a color epaper tablet or ereader, you’ll have an idea of what the image looks like. It’s not high-definition and the colors aren’t super vibrant, but the effect is pleasantly subdued and, for the right images, looks properly arty. </p>
<p>Even under the always-too-bright glare of the CES show floor lights, the images managed to look lush and saturated. With the right (human-generated) art, I’d be happy to hang this in my living room. </p>
<p>The standard-sized display will run you $399, which is $100 cheaper than Aura’s similarly sized device and $50 more than SwitchBot’s. Pre-orders for Fraimic are open now and units are expected to ship in spring of this year. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Daily life can get loud, and meditation apps offer a simple way to carve out a little breathing room. You do not need experience to start, and you do not need to commit to long sessions either. Most apps guide you through short practices that help with focus, sleep and stress, making it easy to build a routine even on busy days.<br><br>There are plenty of meditation apps to choose from, each with its own style and approach. Some focus on mindfulness basics, others offer structured programs and a few add community features for accountability. I tested the most popular options to find the best meditation apps for anyone who wants more calm and clarity in their day.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-meditation-apps">How we tested meditation apps</h2> 
<p>Every brain is different, so I did not rate these apps based on if they sync up with my preferred meditation style. First and foremost, I looked for apps that cater to various methods and those that offer guided meditations that go beyond what’s free on YouTube. All of the items on this list are available on both Android and iOS, so you won’t have to worry about something being only for iPhone owners.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Of course, there’s lots of free stuff out there, from podcasts and videos on YouTube to audio tracks on streaming services. You can even find guided breathing sessions on an Apple Watch or Fitbit, as well as meditations in Fitness+, Samsung Health or any number of workout video providers. For this guide, I focused on apps that stood out in some way. I liked apps with huge libraries of guided meditations and those that offer additional mindfulness activities, like yoga routines. I also looked for easy-to-use apps with well-designed layouts. You don’t want to start your meditation journey with a clunky app that actually increases anxiety.</p> 
<p>The most important thing with meditation is to keep doing it, so I awarded points for clever gamification elements, simple social network integration and anything else that encourages repeat visits. Finally, I considered extra features that set an app apart from the glut of competitors out there. For example, some meditation apps offer novel ways to track your progress, access to yoga routines and a whole lot more.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, each of these apps has its strengths. But if installing an app or using a device is not how you prefer to meditate, you can always turn off your phone and find a quiet room or environment. For those of us who need a little help from a digital guru, though, here are our favorite apps for meditation.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-meditation-gear-we-tested">Other meditation gear we tested</h2> 
<p>Brain-tracking wearables have been around for years, but there are some newer devices that have been tailor-made for meditators. These gadgets track the brain during meditations and offer real-time feedback. It’s a real boon for the data-obsessed, but also a real bank account drainer, with some gadgets costing thousands of dollars. I took two of the more-popular options for a spin to see what they’d make of my brain.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sensai-neurofeedback-system">Sens.ai Neurofeedback System</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://sens.ai/">Sens.ai</a> is a weird contraption that not only claims to track brainwaves, but gives real-time feedback to “teach” people how to meditate and enter a flow state. The device involves a giant headset that’s stuffed with brainwave sensors that detect beta, alpha, theta and gamma waves, in addition to heart-rate sensors. It also comes with a truly bizarre companion gadget that uses light stimulation (transcranial photobiomodulation) to keep an eye on focus and attention levels. The whole thing is combined with an app that keeps track of dozens of data metrics and allows access to various guided meditations.</p> 
<p>I’m as surprised as you to say that this thing appears to work, with some caveats. It’s uncanny how well it monitors the brain during meditations. If I got lost in a thought spiral about lasagna at six minutes in, sure enough, there would be a dip in analytics at the six-minute mark. It’s also fairly easy to use, despite a process that involves wetting a number of electrodes. As magical as the accurate brain-tracking seems to be, however, I wasn’t as keen on the actual training portion, which often involves staring at a screen throughout the entirety of the practice. It’s also not for the financial faint of heart, as the Sens.ai device costs $1,500.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-neorhythm-omnipemf">NeoRhythm Omnipemf</h3> 
<p>NeoRhythm’s Omnipemf <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://caputron.com/products/neorhythm">is another wearable</a> to help people get into that ever-elusive flow state. It doesn’t track your brain, but rather floods it with electromagnetic fields at specific frequencies to make it more susceptible to meditation and focus. This is supposed to prime your brain for the meditative state and, in theory, make it easier to capture that zen. However, I didn’t get much from it, other than a placebo-esque buzzing in my head.</p> 
<p>To use it, you simply pop on the wearable and go about your day. You aren’t tied to an app, so you can meditate in whatever way you like. There are multiple modes that go beyond meditation, as this thing is supposed to help with focus, pain relief and sleep. I’d wait for some peer-reviewed studies, however, before buying this.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/loreal-hapta-lipstick-applicator-at-ces-2023-080653733.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">last</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-18-loreal-is-3d-printing-its-own-human-skin-to-test-cosmetics.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ten or so</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/loreal-hair-color-at-home-device-colorsonic-ces-170049309.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">years</a>, L&#39;Oréal has brought a taste of beauty tech to the masses at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-big-january-conference-120000956.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">CES 2026</a>. This time, it has three devices to show off: the “Light Straight + Multi-styler” as well as the helpfully named LED Face Mask and LED Eye Mask.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t let the unassuming names mislead you. These three products actually harbor some unique traits. The Light Straight (and multi-styler, which I’m going to just call the Light Straight from here on), for instance, uses infrared light to help generate the heat required to style your hair. Meanwhile, the LED Face Mask is different from those made by companies like Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/shark-joins-the-high-tech-skincare-mask-war-with-an-impressive-ces-2025-opening-shot-214804543.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Shark</a>. Instead of fairly hard shells that sit rigidly on your face, L&#39;Oréal’s version looks to be pliable and thin.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven’t seen this in person yet, though I do intend to do so as soon as possible, but the pictures of the LED Eye Mask look, and I mean this in the best way, <em>ridonkulous. </em>Not only do they appear supple, but they also seem to be transparent, with bulbs and wires you can see inside. In some of the images that the company provided, the masks are completely awash in red as the lights are on. In others, only parts of it are red. One of them even shows the masks sitting in a little carrying case and they almost look like wireless earbuds. I haven’t seen any photos of the LED Face Mask but I can imagine they’d be fairly similar to these.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-7.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-7.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The L&#39;Or&#xe9;al LED Eye Mask in a carrying case" data-uuid="6c0506c9-5dfd-41cc-954d-a4e23a1e2c2b"/><figcaption>The L&#39;Oréal LED Eye Mask in a carrying case</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">L&#39;Oréal </div></figure><p>According to the press release, this “ultra-thin, flexible silicone mask” is currently “in prototype form” and was developed in collaboration with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ismartdevelopments.com/about/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">LED solutions company iSmart</a>. The company said this mask “delivers light directly to the face” in 10-minute automatically timed sessions. That’s not too different from existing red light masks, but L’Oréal said it believes “the key to the mask’s effectiveness is its advanced, transparent support, which integrates a skin-safe microcircuit to precisely control the emission of two selected wavelengths of light—red light (630 nm) and near-infrared light (830 nm).”</p><p>Since the mask is only launching in 2027, there aren’t details yet on pricing and availability, though the company’s global vice president of tech and open innovation Guive Balooch told Engadget that it would be a premium product that would sit somewhere below the highest priced offerings currently out there.</p><p>One of my problems with full-face LED masks is that my skin always feels too parched under them, because you have to use them on clean, dry skin for 10 minutes at a time. Balooch told me that L&#39;Oréal would have a serum developed to be used with its mask that would help with that, while also improving the effectiveness of the light treatment.</p><p>That certainly is intriguing, and Balooch indicated that creating formulations that are designed to work with devices like the LED masks is a future direction for the company.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Light-Straight_3_16x9.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Light-Straight_3_16x9.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="A pair of hands using the L&#39;Or&#xe9;al Light Straight and multi-styler on a person&#39;s hair.

According to the company’s press release, hair straighteners with “ordinary heating places can reach temperatures of 400°F and higher—above the threshold at which keratin denatures, leading to weakened cuticles, breakage and reduced shine.” For context, I used to turn my flatiron all the way up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit to tame my tresses (though these days I find a more reasonable 330 degrees is good enough).</p><p>L’Oréal says the Light Straight and its “patented infrared light technology” can “help provide exceptional styling results at lower temperatures, to better protect the health of the hair.” The device’s glass plates never exceed 320 degrees, and the company says its testing found that the Light Straight is three times faster and leaves hair twice as smooth as “leading premium hair stylers.” I’m not sure how you would quantify smoothness, but I’m hopeful the results do pan out in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>The Light Straight uses near-infrared light that L’Oréal says “penetrates deeply into hair fibers” to “reshape internal hydrogen bonds.” It also has sensors onboard with “built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning” to adapt to your gestures “to maximize individual experience.” I’m not sure what that means, but I hope to find out more this week at CES. Given the Light Straight doesn’t launch till 2027, it’s not surprising that pricing and other details aren’t yet available. But for now, I’m keen to see companies continue to investigate novel, hopefully healthier ways for us to look and feel beautiful.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/loreals-ces-2026-beauty-devices-include-a-skin-like-flexible-led-mask-070000576.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung announced its newest portable projector ahead of its First Look showcase at CES 2026, but you might have been a little confused as to what’s changed. The company says the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html"><ins>Freestyle+</ins></a> is nearly twice as bright as the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2023-freestyle-portable-projector-cloud-gaming-edge-blending-031336930.html">2022 Freestyle projector</a>, rated at 230 ISO lumens, which was pretty underwhelming. The new Freestyle+ can output at 430 ISO lumens. If this is the first you’re hearing of ISO Lumens, it’s an internationally standardized rating for projectors, intended to standardize manufacturers&#39; claims of brightness.</p>
<p>It still looks very similar to its predecessors, with 160 degrees of rotation that makes it easy to set up in most homes, Airbnbs or meeting rooms. Samsung added support for Q-Symphony, allowing you to connect it to the company’s soundbars, if you conveniently have one nearby. While the sound quality of its built-in speaker was hard to test in the middle of a post-keynote trade show floor, you’ll probably want to augment the built-in speaker, if only because it’s so small.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vision AI, mentioned several times during Samsung’s CES keynote, is also built into the portable projector. You can summon Bixby to adjust settings and whatever you’re watching. Based on the demos I saw, you’ll need to speak into the remote to access Bixby.</p>
<p>Other improvements bring the projector into 2026, with keystone correction and focus. The Freestyle+’s AI OptiScreen can calibrate projections to different wall surfaces and colors to improve visibility even on your most vivid walls.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6825cde0-e9f6-11f0-bb3b-f9df6ed116f0" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6825cde0-e9f6-11f0-bb3b-f9df6ed116f0" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung Freestyle+ hands-on" data-uuid="4d41f88b-2d61-34b3-8b24-586eb77215ea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The updated 3D Auto Keystone corrects distortion even when projecting onto uneven or non-flat surfaces, such as corners, curtains or angled walls. It’s hard to put into words, but pointing the Freestyle+ to a corner, or at an undulating curtain, and watching the image morph and contort was almost hypnotic. The premise is that you can point this at any area of your home (or even, say, the side of a tent), and the 3D Auto Keystone will flatten the image in seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also Screen Fit, which automatically adjusts the image to match a projector screen size. The Freestyle+ can project up to a 100-inch 1080p image, at maximum. However, Wall Calibration might be the most technically impressive in a device this size. It detects and analyzes the color of the projection surface and recalibrates the image’s color tone to minimize the effect. It can even detect and match a wall pattern to reduce visual interference, which worked well in person. The Samsung spokesperson used the aforementioned Bixby voice commands to calibrate the screen.</p>
<p>If there’s still something to address, it’s that this portable projector must be plugged in to operate. When that can be either a power bank or a wall outlet, it seems a bit cheeky to call it portable.</p>
<p>Samsung typically announces prices and launch dates once the CES dust has settled, but it&#39;s set to arrive in the first half of 2026. Previous iterations cost around $900, but early impressions suggest it’s a versatile, petite projector.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amid endless AI hype and a guest visit from the CEO of Hartford Steam Boiler (?!), Samsung had a big surprise for us tonight at CES 2026: A massive 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It’s so large, it’s suspended by a large metal stand that surrounds the entire screen,  which also lets you tilt the screen just a bit. (For the Samsung diehards, it’s basically a reinvention of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/part%E2%85%A1-a-timeless-gallery-design-that-redefines-the-space-we-live-in" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">“timeless gallery” stand from 2013</a>.)  I imagine bringing this TV home would be like Bart Simpson adopting his beloved elephant Stampy: Your pets would be terrified, and your family would probably be annoyed at this television dominating so much of your home.</p><p>But boy, it sure looks amazing in person. Just like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">LG’s Micro RGB set</a>, it’s using an evolved form of Mini LED technology that allows for far better color accuracy and richness. As I fought through the crowds of Samsung’s CES First Look event to catch a glimpse of it, I couldn’t help but notice how everyone just looked a bit stunned, like the monkeys from <em>2001</em>  seeing the monolith for the first time.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-2.jpg" style="height:1343px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the side." data-uuid="706563cd-8282-402b-a3ce-1f3fe7c35725"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the side.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung representatives were clear that this Micro RGB set was only a concept of what the company could do with the technology, it’s not an actual product it plans to ship. In another demo, Samsung took the 130-inch screen and mounted it directly on a wall (below). Of course, it still looked stunning. I also learned that if you wanted to wall mount the “timeless gallery” stand concept, you actually have to mount the entire stand to the wall, since it’s part of the TV’s speaker system.</p><p>Samsung didn’t have too many details about the technical aspects of the 130-inch Micro RGB TV, but it did shout buzzwords at us during its announcement. it’s powered by the company’s “Micro RGB AI Engine Pro” processor, which includes “Micro RGB Color Booster Pro” and “Micro RGB HDR Pro” technology, using AI to “enhance dull tones and refine contrast, delivering vivid color and subtle detail across bright and dark scenes alike for realism and picture fidelity.”</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-4.jpg" style="height:1297px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV mounted in a wall." data-uuid="f15f1a3b-0d6b-4489-8c32-c468fac6357f"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV mounted in a wall.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Micro RGB set also sports the company’s Glare Free technology to reduce reflections, and it supports HDR 10+ Advanced and the company’s Eclipsa Audio. It can also tap into Samsung’s Vision AI Companion for conversational search, as well as Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity.</p><p>But of course, those details really don’t matter, because you won’t be able to buy the 130-inch Micro RGB TV in its current form. We were impressed by last year’s 115-inch model, but its $30,000 price didn’t make it feasible for anyone but the ultra-rich. And those folks would be better off investing in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-110000-microled-tv-in-this-economy-144340352.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Samsung’s own Micro LED sets</a>, which offer the benefits of OLED that Micro RGB does not. (Sure, those TVs start at $110,000, but for that’s not exactly a huge leap for those with deep pockets.)   </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-3.jpg" style="height:1281px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the rear." data-uuid="10d215f9-9095-4fbc-8e17-f053fdac0178"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the rear.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In addition to its annual soundbar updates, Samsung <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">debuted two new home speakers</a> at CES 2026. The Music Studio 5 and 7 are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi units designed to blend in with your home decor thanks to their minimalist look. They certainly don’t look like your typical speakers, and Samsung has packed them with features that it says will ensure optimal sound quality from each one.&nbsp;</p><p>The Music Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and two tweeters, and a sound profile that’s optimized by AI Dynamic Bass Control. The design is an interesting interplay between a circle and a square, but the speaker delivers crisp, clear sound — even in the roar of a CES demo area. The Music Studio 5 will also come in a smattering of colors, which could lend a pop to a bookshelf. Controls line the top edge, including one-touch access to Spotify.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sound-studio-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sound-studio-4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung Music Studio 7" data-uuid="fe0cf0de-0c72-440c-be41-f4034346aa76"/><figcaption>Samsung Music Studio 7</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re looking for something more robust, the Music Studio 7 is a 3.1.1-channel unit that’s capable of four-direction spatial audio and high-resolution listening. Samsung says you can enjoy tunes at up to up to 24-bit/96kHz and the speaker can be used as part of a turntable setup. The sound here is more robust as I heard noticeably more bass from the 7 than on the 5. The various control buttons are up top here as well, positioned near the front of the speaker for easy access. </p><p>You can also use up to four Music Studio speakers as a surround sound setup in your living room. I listened to a brief demo where Samsung was using four Music Studio 7 units in a makeshift home theater. This combo provided great immersion, with lots of detail in the directional sound in the clips being broadcast on the connected TV. Samsung also says you can use up to 10 Music Studio speakers for audio only.</p><p>The company didn’t announce any pricing details yet, but that’s likely to come just before the Music Studio speakers are available for purchase. That date is TBD as well. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re used to Samsung <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-debuts-the-qs700f-soundbar-and-updates-the-q990-at-ces-2025-030042257.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">updating its Q990 soundbar at CES every year</a>, and 2026 is no different. However, the company also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">debuted the HW-QS90H</a>: a new all-in-one option that Samsung says won’t require a standalone subwoofer due to its Quad Bass Woofer system. The QS90H offers 7.1.2-channel audio with 13 total drivers. Before the show properly kicks off, we got to listen to the new soundbar for a quick judge of its merits.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing I noticed about the QS90H is its impressive bass performance. Most of the time when a company claims its soundbar doesn’t need a subwoofer, that proves to be untrue. But even in the chaos of a noisy demo area, I could clearly hear the bassy thump coming from the QS90H’s built-in subwoofers. For once, I think would-be buyers could get by without a sub, especially in smaller living rooms. </p><p>Samsung achieved this with two of those Quad woofers. These drivers push air in two directions rather than just one, which helps with the extra low-end tone. The company didn’t sacrifice clarity either. The nine additional drivers, positioned for front, side, wide and up firing sound, provide the clear detail I’ve come to expect from Samsung.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/qs90h-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/qs90h-1.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung QS90H soundbar" data-uuid="3a472cfd-3a80-4af6-a3d2-b62412cd5a3b"/><figcaption>Samsung QS90H soundbar</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>The QS90H also features Samsung’s Convertible Fit Design technology that debuted on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs700f-soundbar-review-sophisticated-design-automatic-adjustments-180035549.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">QS700F</a> last year. This tool allows you to sit the soundbar flat on a shelf or mantle, or rotate it to mount on the wall. Built-in sensors automatically adjust the driver performance for each orientation, so that sound quality isn’t affected by the selected positioning. During my demo, I didn’t notice any difference in performance when the orientation changed. In fact, the QS90H looks a lot like the QS700F on the outside, with similar grille patters and control designs. </p><p>Samsung didn’t announce pricing or availability tonight, but that’s likely to come just prior to any on-sale date. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG usually announces its CES TV lineup well ahead of the show, but this year the company had a surprise at CES 2026: The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">return of its ultra-thin &quot;Wallpaper&quot; TV</a>. Now it&#39;s toting a gorgeous OLED screen and wireless connectivity, and it&#39;s about as thin as a pencil. We got a chance to check out the Wallpaper TV in action during a CES preview event, as well as the previously announced Gallery and Micro RGB sets. LG still has its typically OLED and LED sets around, but it&#39;s clear that 2026 will be filled with intriguing TVs for a variety of consumers.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" style="height:1396px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV" data-uuid="58f3d374-411f-4f30-ace0-0a163a26875f"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="831aff76-954b-413f-ad53-1c525ef027ff">The Wallpaper TV (LG W6)</h2><p>If money were no object, I&#39;d want a 100-inch LG Wallpaper TV in my family room immediately. It looks shockingly thin in person — almost as if it&#39;s some sort of sci-fi prop — and it delivers the rich colors and dark levels we expect from OLED. Cable management is also a cinch, since it requires just a single power cable. The A/V inputs are handled by LG&#39;s One Connect box, which you can position wirelessly up to 10 meters away from the TV. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" style="height:1333px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear" data-uuid="76d95849-a1b3-4ee2-b3e8-944800c0dba6"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The LG W6 combines the best of LG&#39;s OLED technology, including &quot;Hyper Radiant Color&quot; for improved black levels and color, &quot;Brightness Booster Ultra&quot; to crank up luminance 3.9 times more than conventional OLEDs and a reflection free screen material. LG&#39;s Alpha 9 Gen 3 processor beefs up its performance, and its NPU also helps to improve upscaling and overall image performance. (And yes, you can also access generative AI features via Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.)</p><p>All of that adds up to one of the most remarkable TVs I&#39;ve seen in years. I haven&#39;t been too enamored with other TV gimmicks lately, like everything trying to mimic Samsung&#39;s The Frame, or the usless 8K sets. But a super-thin wireless TV with the best OLED panel available? That&#39;s the stuff dreams are made of. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" style="height:1253px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV" data-uuid="3419e13f-8e77-4dd1-8a33-97994b44a84c"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="c4158606-b48b-431e-b6d6-e9e573054349">The Gallery TV competes with Samsung’s Frame</h2><p>While LG has made Gallery TVs before, in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2026 it&#39;s making a more concerted effort</a> to take on Samsung&#39;s popular Frame TV. LG says the new sets were designed with the help of museum curators, which helps the &quot;Gallery Mode&quot; adjust brightness and contrast to specific works of art. They also ship with magnetic frame-like bezels, and they have anti-reflective screens to help make the art shine. </p><p>In person, the new Gallery TV looks fine, though it&#39;s easy to tell that the colors and contrast levels don&#39;t match LG&#39;s premium OLED TVs.  To avoid burn-in issues, these sets feature Mini LED panels. As I noted above, I&#39;m not the core consumer for one of these TVs, but it&#39;s nice to see more competition against Samsung&#39;s Frame TVs. (Despite pioneering the idea of TVs displaying art, the Frame sets are still fairly mediocre when it comes to actually watching TV shows and movies.) </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" style="height:1316px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="72bf06b4-100f-4522-a0be-2025ac961562"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="0b43ff1a-5c6e-434e-b754-a7d35f025952"><strong>Micro RGB looks like a genuine Mini LED upgrade</strong></h2><p>As if we needed more TV acronyms to worry about, say hello to Micro RGB, a new technology built atop Mini LED to cover vastly more color range. Just don&#39;t confuse it with Micro LED, which is the wildly expensive evolutionary step forward for OLED. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">LG already announced its Micro RGB set</a> a few weeks ago, but that didn&#39;t prepare me for standing in front of the 100-inch demo TV it brought to CES. Throughout a variety of clips, colors looked wonderfully rich, and the overall texture of the images looked surprisingly life-like. </p><p>I&#39;d have to compare it to LG&#39;s Wall TV side-by-side to truly see how Micro RGB competes with OLED, but technically OLED should still offer better contrast and black levels, since each of its pixels are self-emissive. But sure, if I couldn&#39;t get a 100-inch Wall TV in my family room, I certainly wouldn&#39;t turn down an enormous Micro RGB. </p><h2 id="c5a82153-d91f-4549-93d2-6ed9c5eee16d"><strong>What about LG&#39;s other OLED TVs?</strong></h2><p>All of the next-generation OLED technology in the wallpaper TV will also make its way into LG&#39;s G6 OLED models, while the new C6 and other lines will see improvements of their own. All I can say is that the new G6 OLED looked impressive, with a noticeably brighter picture and HDR elements compared to G-series OLEDs from several years ago.  </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-lg-w-series-oled-4k.html">Wallpaper TV</a> that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the &quot;world&#39;s thinnest&quot; OLED that&#39;s truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.</p>
<p>Instead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It&#39;s similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-is-not-selling-the-frame-pro-for-cheap-185607096.html">Frame TV lineup</a>. While you won&#39;t have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor&#39;s hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That&#39;s more than three times the thickness, but it&#39;s still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.</p>

<p>The latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG&#39;s third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There&#39;s even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG  specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.</p>
<p>The updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that&#39;s crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync, AMD&#39;s FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you&#39;re not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html">Gallery+</a> feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.</p>

<p>LG didn&#39;t reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn&#39;t offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-28-lgs-77-inch-wallpaper-tv-is-selling-for-the-low-low-price-of-2.html">Wallpaper TV</a>, which cost up to $20,000.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://takway.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Takway</a>, a startup that wants to be the &quot;Nintendo of the AI robot era,&quot; has unveiled a Tamagotchi-like virtual pet at CES 2026 that&#39;s meant to go with you everywhere and develop a unique personality in the process. Sweekar is an AI companion built into a palm-sized toy, a cutesy egg-shaped device with ears and a screen for its face. As with a Tamagotchi, you&#39;ll have to feed and play with it to keep it happy and healthy, and its mood and facial expressions will reflect your care. But this virtual pet will remember your voice and the activities you&#39;ve done together — and once it&#39;s grown up, it will keep itself entertained, go off on its own virtual excursions (kind of like a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/this-self-care-virtual-pet-is-helping-me-get-my-act-together-160027169.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Finch birb</a>) and bring back tales of its adventures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sweekar_product_01_view.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sweekar_product_01_view.png" style="height:720px;width:1280px;" alt="The Sweekar pocket pet being placed into a large brown checkered purse" data-uuid="4ef77bb1-90a5-4e16-bb7d-63cffa4520e0"/><figcaption>The Sweekar pocket pet being placed into a large brown checkered purse</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Takway</div></figure><p>Sweekar comes in pink, yellow and blue, but there will also be the option to switch up the shells and buy silly little outfits for it, because why not. The pocket pet has four life stages, becoming less needy as it grows. </p><p>It starts out as a closed egg for its two-day incubation period, after which it will &quot;break&quot; its shell to reveal a face. From then on, you have to keep it alive with care tasks and attention in order to raise it through the baby and teen stages. Once it&#39;s an adult though, it will be able to care for itself autonomously. That means you no longer run the risk of killing it through neglect. Sweekar is unkillable from Level 51 on. (At least, in the virtual sense. Hardware can always break, and you&#39;ll have to keep it charged).</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lil_friends.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lil_friends.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfit" data-uuid="3caca9cf-6b86-4f44-8c86-2b2815daf753"/><figcaption>Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfit</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>There&#39;s no set price for it just yet, but Sweekar will likely fall within the $100-$150 range once it becomes available.

But while some companies are chasing humanoids that can help you do stuff, there are also a surprising number of robots whose main job is to be cute and keep you company.</p><p>Japanese startup Ludens AI is showing off two extremely adorable robot companions at CES. Cocomo is an autonomous robot pet that can follow you around the house and respond to voice and touch. It has a fuzzy, egg-shaped body, but the version we saw at CES was wearing an orange suit with ears that made it look a bit like a teddy bear. It was moving around on a wheeled base, but it also has tiny legs if you prefer to carry it around and hold it.&nbsp;</p><p>Cocoo&#39;s exterior is meant to stay close to human body temperature at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and the company says it will rise up to 102 degrees in &quot;high contact&quot; situations like hugging it. And while Cocomo can interact and respond to your actions, it &quot;speaks&quot; with hums and other sounds rather than words.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ludens AI brought some very cute robots to CES 2026.

</div><p>We didn&#39;t get to witness many of its abilities in action due to the loud environment, but Ludens says that Cocomo is designed to bond with its owners over time. &quot;Cocomo engages through spontaneous gestures, imitation, and gentle initiation - learning what makes you laugh, what comforts you, and when to surprise you,&quot; the company says.&nbsp;</p><p>Ludens&nbsp;didn&#39;t share pricing or availability info for Cocomo, but has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ludensai.com/cocomo" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a waitlist</a> where you can sign up for updates in a forthcoming crowdfunding campaign.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cocomo_long.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cocomo_long.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Ludens AI&#39;s Inu robot." data-uuid="a248fdb6-1c3f-4132-bbbf-32fa7bd52602"/><figcaption>Ludens AI&#39;s Inu robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Ludens also showed off a smaller, but also very adorable, robot called Inu, which it describes as a &quot;desktop alien pupu.&quot; Rather than a robot that can move with you from room to room, Inu is meant to sit on your desk and keep you company while you work. It can also interact via audio and movement. It has a little tail that wiggles in response to voice and touch and its single eye can &quot;blink.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Ludens plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign for Inu later this year.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/japanese-startup-ludens-ai-brought-two-very-adorable-robots-to-ces-2026-021914130.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a slew of keyboards and apps that help people learn how to play the piano, but a small company called PopuMusic is showing off an intriguing set of products at CES to make the process easier.  PartyKeys and PartyStudio are a 36-key MIDI keyboard and MIDI / Bluetooth speaker that pair together in seamless fashion. The PartyStudio is particularly interesting because it has a built-in library of 128 instrument tones and more than 50 different drum machine patterns. Naturally, it works with the PartyKeys, but any MIDI keyboard can connect to it and use those sounds. </p><p>The PartyStudio and PartyKeys both use NFC to connect to each other — you can just tap and hold the keyboard up to the speaker for pairing. You can connect up to three devices using MIDI over Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE MIDI) as well as a fourth using a wired connection. If you have more than one keyboard, meanwhile, you can connect them together with NFC as well — you can pair three keyboards together total, giving you a huge 108-key surface to play.</p><p>Both the PartyStudio and PartyKeys have an understated but appealing look to them (they’re available in black or white) and feel quite substantial and well-made. PopuMusic has been releasing hardware via Kickstarters campaigns for a few years now, so even though they’re a relatively small and new company they have some experience in this department. The speaker seems to hit a nice balance of portability and power; it has two tweeters and two woofers and weighs in at 3.75 pounds. It’s about 13.5 inches wide, 5.2 inches tall and 4 inches deep, so it’s not a tiny speaker you’ll just throw in your bag, but it still feels easy to tote around thanks to its attached handle.</p><p>The other trick that the PartyStudio and PartyKeys have is on the software side. Using a companion app, multiple people can play along with a song. The light-up keyboard can show you what to play, and if you have multiple people playing each keyboard can display complimentary parts. It starts with simple three-key chord voicings, but I also saw a demo that used a familiar Guitar Hero-style interface of different notes flying down the screen, making for a more involved and advanced performance.</p><p>The PartyKeys are up for order on Kickstarter now for $199, while the PartyStudio costs $349. The company says they’re on track to ship both products in Q1 of 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/partystudio-is-a-wireless-midi-speaker-with-128-built-in-instrument-sounds-015511003.html?src=rss]]></description>

Instead, it’s launching the AI MindClip, a wearable microphone which records and transcribes every noise to come from your mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>The company isn’t alone, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">many others</a> turning up to CES this year offering devices to log your thoughts through the day. But SwitchBot does hope to distinguish itself from the crowd with an AI which can both summarize and extract useful data from your chats. The company’s representatives said it will use its initiative and create its own reminders based on what it thinks you’ll need to remember. Sadly, we couldn’t get to see it working in person, and we don’t know when it’ll be available or how much it’ll cost.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>But it’ll probably be a little bit cheaper than a chaise lounge.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/switchbot-turned-up-to-ces-with-an-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say-014959824.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Smart locks have a notable inconvenience: running out of power. Lockin, maker of vein-recognition locks, debuted its newest model on the CES floor. It charges wirelessly via an optical infrared beam with a four-meter range.  A small device, connected to a standard outlet inside the house, shoots a beam at the lock, which has a small receptor panel that turns the light into power, sort of like a plug-in sun beaming at a tiny solar array.  The tech carries certifications from two independent organizations, and won’t harm eyeballs or bodies that get in the way of the beam (though if the beam is interrupted, charging stops). </p><p>The lock itself is a mortise lock that will likely require a pro to install, as it’s not just a standard deadbolt replacer. It’s not a standard lock in other ways too, with video and speaker capabilites, AI recognition as well as touchscreen features and vein recognition. </p><p>The tall black rectangle looked sleek (if huge) in person with a pocket-style grip and a rather sizable display on the interior panel. The outer panel has a touchscreen along with two cameras allowing it to act as a doorbell video camera. You can unlock the door via palm, finger vein or 3D facial recognition. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lockin_V7_Max.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lockin_V7_Max.jpg" style="height:1490px;width:2650px;" alt="Lockin V7 Max smart lock" data-uuid="26f0e007-e375-4979-baf2-0adda50fec1e"/><figcaption>Lockin V7 Max smart lock</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lockin</div></figure><p>It’ll feed the video to any of the major smart home eco systems, including those from Google, Apple, Amazon and Samsung. But for general setup and advanced AI features, such as recognizing a package delivery and speaking a canned request to the driver, you’d use Lockin’s own app. </p><p>I can’t imagine this high-end do-everything lock will be cheap, and indeed the price is currently undisclosed, but units should start shipping in July or August of this year. There’s a cheaper version of the lock, with the same wireless charging capability but without the video features, that’ll sell for $350 and will be available in April. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lockins-everlasting-vein-recognizing-smart-lock-doorbell-cam-combo-is-peak-ces-013431113.html?src=rss]]></description>

While the CES show floor doesn't officially open until Tuesday, January 6, Las Vegas is already abuzz with various pre-show events, including the CES Unveiled mini show and Samsung's First Look press conference, scheduled for late Sunday. Nearly all day Monday will be comprised of more press conferences from the likes of LG, Intel, NVIDIA and Sony. And that doesn't include the product demos, announcements and networking that will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. Engadget is covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.</p><p>More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.</p><h2 id="cbc11c13-20f0-4f78-bd1e-8f9d8de8b7b3">The CES 2026 schedule</h2><p>Press conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES.

Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. </p><p>That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5.

It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1764577431" data-i13n="slk:a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor;cpos:50;pos:1">a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor</a> coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.</p><p>Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ces.tech/schedule/" data-i13n="slk:HDR10+ Advanced standard;cpos:51;pos:1">HDR10+ Advanced standard</a> would be Samsung's answer to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-announces-dolby-vision-2-expanding-picture-quality-beyond-hdr-123019504.html" data-i13n="slk:Dolby Vision 2;cpos:52;pos:1">Dolby Vision 2</a>, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been on the fence about trying the sort of “AR glasses” that, until recently, were called “personal cinemas,” then check this out. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Xreal</a> has turned up to CES 2026 with an updated version of its entry level <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-new-one-series-ar-glasses-use-usb-c-to-connect-with-nearly-any-device-191221387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xreal One glasses</a>, first launched at the end of 2024. The new model, dubbed the 1S (yes, with a numeral rather than the word) gets marginally better specs and $50 knocked from the asking price.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, One is a wearable spatial display that connects over USB-C to any compatible device including smartphones, tablets, laptops and consoles. It has two teeny-tiny displays in the eyecups that, when worn close to the eyes, trick your brain into thinking you’re looking at a big screen. The average would measure in at around 171 inches, but it’s possible to push the view to a screen closer to 500 inches if your eyes are capable of focusing that far.</p>
<p>As for the changes, they’re all firmly in the welcome nip-and-tuck department, boosting many of the original’s key specs. For instance, the 1080p screens have been swapped out for 1200p full HD, while the field of view has gone from 50 degrees to 52. Brightness has been boosted from 600 nits on the old model to 700 nits here, while the aspect ratio has grown from 16x9 to 16x10. But the change Xreal is arguably most proud of is the drop in price, from $499 down to $449.</p>
<p>Certainly, the bustling trade show floor is not the best place to sample the delights of Xreal’s 1S, but it was able to make a fairly persuasive argument as to its value. I was able to view <em>Avatar: One Of The Avatar Movies</em> and my eyes were almost tricked into thinking it was viewing it in a small multiplex cinema room. The usual Xreal strengths — that they don’t cause me eyestrain and offer a compelling degree of immersion — are fully evident here.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company is launching the Xreal Neo, an external battery-cum-DisplayPort hub for your glasses. Inside you’ll find a 10,000mAh power bank to keep your glasses going for longer and, more importantly, offers better connection for your Switch consoles. After all, before now, if you wanted to play with your Switch or Switch 2, you’d need to hook it up to its own dock. With the Neo, however, you can eliminate that from your bag when you’re playing out and about. That’s available as a standalone purchase for $99 which, like the new 1S, are ready to buy right now.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2023, Withings launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-body-scan-connected-health-station-is-amazing-if-inessential-140001021.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Body Scan, a super-premium scale with the sort of tech found in a high-end gym or low-end clinic</a>. It had a six-lead ECG, offered segmented body composition and could monitor your nerve health, among other things. Now the company has rocked up at CES 2026 in Las Vegas with a second-generation model that adds in tests for hypertension and cellular health. Withings hopes the new model will give you even more data you can use to fight against chronic illnesses brought on by our decadent modern lifestyle.</p>
<p>The first generation Body Scan checked 40 biomarkers, while the new model has 60, and even the press materials need a bulleted list to talk about the new features. Topping the bill is the new Impedance Cardiography (ICG) which monitors your heart’s capacity to pump blood to the organs. Second, Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) uses a low level electrical current to check your body’s total water, letting the scale keep an eye on your cellular age, active cell mass and metabolic efficiency.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of this data will then be extruded through the company’s “clinically validated” AI model to offer more insights, such as your risk of hypertension and glycemic regulation. You’ll also be told, based on your vital statistics, your health trajectory, and given tips on how to improve your “healthspan.” In short, the company wants to further position this as a clinic in a box, steering you toward healthier choices as and when it can.</p>
<p>There’s one major hardware tweak from the first generation, as the retractable handle used for the ECG now contains the scale’s display. That, I’m sure, makes it easier to read if you’re squinting naked onto the scale after your morning shower. But I’m also concerned that it’s a single point of failure for the thin cable attaching the handle to the rest of the scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Withings hopes to get the Body Scan 2 cleared by the FDA in time for its planned launch in the second quarter of 2026. As for the price, expect to pay a pretty penny for the flagship gear, as it will set you back $599.95, €499.95 or £449.95, depending on your territory.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/shures-movemic-88-is-the-first-wireless-direct-to-phone-microphone-with-selectable-polar-patterns-164052767.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Shure’s</a> original MV88 microphone (no, not <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the + version</a>) was a convenient snap-on option for iPhone users. Since Apple ditched the port for USB-C, the audio accessory became obsolete for newer handsets. At CES 2026, the company debuted a revised version of the mic, swapping the Lightning connection for USB-C, which also adds compatibility for Android users and a host of other devices. The best part is the updated MV88 is available now, and it’s priced at $159. </p>
<p>If you missed the 2015 version, the MV88 is a compact stereo condenser microphone that simply snaps onto a phone, tablet or one of your laptop’s ports. It provides a packable boost to any built-in mics on your devices, allowing you to capture better audio for voice and video clips. What’s more, it’s a simple, plug-and-play option that doesn’t require additional setup. And if you choose to employ Shure’s suite of apps, you’ll get access to things like presets, microphone gain control, a five-band EQ, limiter, compression and a high-pass filter. Plus, the company’s apps will give you a microphone level meter to keep tabs on your input. </p>

<p>With Auto Level Mode, the mic automatically adjusts gain in real time so that your clips aren’t too loud or too quiet. There’s also a Real-Time Denoiser that works to reduce background noise. The MV88 USB-C has four selectable polar patterns — stereo, mono cardioid, mono bi-directional and raw mid-side — and you can tilt the microphone so that it either points straight up or towards you. </p>
<p>I’ve been testing the new MV88 for a few days ahead of CES and I can confirm it’s a substantial boost over anything a device’s built-in microphone can offer. It’s also a nice alternative to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/shures-first-wireless-lapel-mic-can-connect-to-your-phone-without-a-receiver-221517242.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">popular lapel mics</a> you’ve likely seen creators and influencers use. Those need to be held close to the speaker’s mouth, so they don’t pic up ambient sound or multiple speakers well without moving them. The MV88 would the better choice for capturing clips of live music, the great outdoors or other places where you want some level of background noise.</p>

<p>Sound quality has been impressive thus far. After barely tweaking any settings, audio capture is warm, but also crisp and clear. That Real-Time Denoiser completely eliminated a noisy hotel room A/C unit during one of my testing sessions. This means the new MV88 will improve my sound if I need to do any voice or video interviews this week from my room. I’m also looking forward to seeing how well it does at some of the evening events and on the CES show floor. </p>
<p>To me, the best part about the MV88 is the quick and easy setup. You literally just snap it on your phone, or another device with a USB-C port, and after a few taps you’re ready to record. Shure also included a small case for the microphone, so it’s less likely to get damaged any time you just need to chuck it in your bag. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Narwal brought new cleaning robots with it to CES this year, including the Narwal Flow 2,  it’s latest flagship robo mop-vac, and the Narwal U50, an automatic mattress vac designed for “deep mite removal.” </p><p>While I’d hoped the latter vac was an automatic crawler that could navigate your mattress top, the U50 is a handheld device. Still, no one likes to think about what filters down into their mattress as they sleep — and there are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/15j42lb/should_i_really_be_vacuuming_my_mattress_once_a/" data-i13n="slk:lots of opinions;cpos:1;pos:1">lots of opinions</a> on how and why to remove those dead skin cells, dust, oils and the mites that arrive to dine on those things. </p><p>Narwal’s mattress vacuum cleaner not only sucks up all that ick, it heats up to 137 degrees and shines a UV light for sterilization. Then it uses high-speed tapping to dislodge what’s living in your bed before sucking it up with 16.000 Pa of suction power. The dust bag seals itself so all the bad stuff stays put before you throw it away. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_mattress_vac.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_mattress_vac.jpg" style="height:1485px;width:2640px;" alt="The Narwal mattress vac uses heat and UV light to clean your bed.

Not only will the bot vacuum around any obstacles it sees, it can let you know they’re there. It also has different modes, including the intriguing PetCare Mode, that not only focuses on “pet zones” (places your dog or cat hangs out),  it can also find your pet. Say you’re not home and don’t see Sparky lying on her usual spot on the couch. Just ask your Flow 2 to locate your dog and it goes off on a special mission, beaming video of your girl sleeping in a sun puddle. Then if you decide to talk, the vacuum will oblige, complete with video and a speaker that lets you talk to your fur baby. </p><p>Of course, the vacuum’s real job is cleaning stuff up and this one uses a track-mop design that keeps infusing the mop with (now hotter) water along with downward pressure to clean up messes. The automatic hot-air drying feature makes sure there’s not too much wetness left behind when its done. The auto-empty base now comes with an upgraded reusable dust bag and washable debris filter, so you throw less stuff away. The collection capacity is rated at 120 days, so you only have to empty the machine once every few months at most. </p><p>The vacuums should be available in Spring of this year.   </p><p></p><p></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_flow_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_flow_2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The new Narwal Flow 2 vac mop" data-uuid="d5ce006f-cada-4cb9-ab15-c57e4ad15720"/><figcaption>The new Narwal Flow 2 vac mop</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Narwal</div></figure><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Belkin just introduced the appropriately-named Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 at CES 2026. This is a high-end charging case specifically designed for Nintendo&#39;s latest console.</p>
<p>The 10,000mAh power bank delivers up to 30W of fast charging, which is a decent enough metric. I&#39;m more excited, however, about the bells and whistles. The Charging Case Pro boasts an LCD screen on the exterior, making it easy to keep track of remaining battery life. It also doubles as a tabletop stand, which is always nice. The built-in Switch 2 stand is better than what we got <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-10-nintendo-switch-adjustable-charging-stand.html">with the first Switch</a>, but it&#39;s still not the sturdiest thing in the world.</p>

<p>It also includes a dedicated flap for game card storage and a hidden compartment for smart trackers. Take that, would-be Switch 2 thieves. Belkin promises this case has been made from premium materials and has been designed for &quot;long-term durability.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At CES 2026, the company had a sample on display (though, bizarrely, no Switch 2 to protect it), so we saw some clever design choices, such as an oval cutout on the front of the case where the battery indicator (and USB-C port) peeks out. On the original, you had to lift out the battery out in order to charge it. The built-in tabletop stand appears solid and can be used both inside and outside the case. (&quot;I knew had should have brought my own Switch 2 along&quot; — Engadget&#39;s Mat Smith.)</p>
<p>The Charging Case Pro is available in off-white, sage and dark grey color options and is available right now and costs $100 — a bump up from the $70 original.</p>

<p>The company also introduced a number of other charging accessories at CES. The UltraCharge Pro Power Bank juices up two devices at once and also costs $100, with availability in February. The BoostCharge power bank is an extremely slim unit that easily slides into pockets. That one starts at $60, but isn&#39;t coming until later in the year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkin-charging-case-for-the-switch-2-ces-2026-screen-for-checking-battery-life-170029146.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Are you ready for CES 2026? While the show floor doesn&#39;t open until Tuesday, things are effectively kicking off this evening with the first big press event of the show. Samsung is taking the stage to set the agenda for the new year and share an overview of its latest and greatest advances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation. Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping press releases left and right, so we know at least some of what to expect in Vegas this year. Of course, we&#39;re holding out hope that we get to hear an update on the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html">Ballie robot</a> — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html">2025 release date</a>.</p>

<p>The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas tonight — Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET (7PM PT). There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung">Samsung Electronic&#39; official YouTube channel</a> (which we&#39;ve embedded below), <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">Samsung Newsroom</a> or via Samsung TV Plus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engadget is on-site at the event, and we&#39;ll be running a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059234.html">Samsung CES 2026 liveblog</a> as well. Tune in for real-time updates and commentary.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-samsung-at-ces-2026">What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026</h2>
<p>Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &quot;new AI-driven customer experiences,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look">said in a press release</a>. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &quot;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&quot;</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung has been following its &quot;Advent calendar&quot; approach to early CES announcements, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">new press releases</a> dropping nearly every day in late December and early January. So far, we know that — like competitors <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html">LG</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html">Hisense</a> — the company will be offering details on a line of <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">micro RGB TVs</a> (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-new-ai-connected-living-lineup-at-ces-2026">Bespoke AI</a>. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html">Music Studio 5 and 7</a>, at CES this year. Additionally, it&#39;ll debut its latest <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html">Freestyle+ portable projector</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html">Odyssey gaming monitor</a>. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen <em>and</em> has glasses-free 3D. It&#39;s likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that Samsung will share even more early CES announcements in the hours preceding its presentation. If that happens, we&#39;ll add them here!</p>
