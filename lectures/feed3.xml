After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.<br><br><strong>Editor's note (September 2025):</strong> Amazon announced a revamped family of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-adds-the-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-and-scribe-3-to-its-writing-tablet-lineup-145031938.html">Kindle Scribe E Ink tablets</a>.

<h2 id="jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> 
<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> 
<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-writing-and-latency">Writing and latency</h3> 
<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading">Reading</h3> 
<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> 
<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> 
<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-search-functionality">Search functionality</h3> 
<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> 
<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity">Sharing and connectivity</h3> 
<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> 
<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> 
<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to "increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: "We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> 
<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p>

The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> 
<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html">Smart Paper</a>, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3>

Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple may be releasing a new iPad Pro with an M5 chip in the very near future, according to an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnzkC2q-iGI">unboxing video made by a Russian YouTuber</a>. This is the same creator that leaked the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip last year, so the information in the video is likely credible.</p>
<p>To that end, the creator unboxes what appears to be a new 13-inch iPad Pro with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage in a Space Black finish. The exterior design doesn&#39;t look noticeably different from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">current models</a>, as the tablet still has a single rear camera, four speakers and a Smart Connector.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0e3fda390d744fceb1d8ba61c3228678"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnzkC2q-iGI?si=LSzB7_Qa0YxYGErD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Previous leaks had indicated that the next iPad Pro <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">would feature a second front camera</a>, but this video doesn&#39;t confirm that. It also looks like this new model is still plenty thin.</p>
<p>The video even puts the tablet through some testing. A Geekbench 6 benchmark shows a 12 percent increase in multi-core CPU performance when compared to the previous generation. This benchmark result suggests a 36 percent faster GPU. It also indicated that the 256GB model of this tablet will include 12GB of RAM. Current models with 256GB of storage ship with just 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The footage shows that this tablet is running <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html">iPadOS 26</a>, which makes sense, and that the battery was manufactured in August of this year. This could all be a ruse but, again, the leaker has been proven correct in the past. It&#39;s likely that Apple will announce the refreshed iPad Pro with the M5 chip sometime in October, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-is-reportedly-on-track-to-launch-the-m5-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-later-this-year-211013731.html">which tracks with previous reporting</a>.</p>
<p>It was also recently reported that the company is working on a refresh of the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-is-reportedly-nearing-production-for-its-latest-m5-powered-macbooks-154148070.html">MacBook Pro laptop with the M5 chip</a>. These computers could be available later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/it-looks-like-an-m5-ipad-pro-is-coming-very-soon-184406117.html?src=rss]]></description>

No sign of a new standard Echo this time!</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Echo Dot Max delivers almost three times the bass of the fifth-gen Echo Dot and sound that adapts to your space, Amazon claims. The company added that the updated design integrates the speaker directly into the device’s housing, freeing up extra space for more bass. In fact, the Echo Dot Max has two speakers: a “high-excursion woofer optimized for deep bass and a custom tweeter for crisp high notes.” </p><p style="text-align:left;">Amazon has shrunk down the Echo Studio to 60 percent of the size of the last version. Even so, it has a “powerful high-excursion woofer that delivers deep, immersive bass and three optimally placed full-range drivers to create immersive,” room-filling sound, according to the company. The latest model supports spatial audio and Dolby Atmos.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If you’re in the US and you snap up either of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazons-new-echo-dot-max-is-a-smart-speaker-for-alexa-150222265.html">the new Echo speakers</a> — or the latest Echo Show devices — Amazon says you’ll get early access to Alexa+.

As with the other Fire TV devices Amazon announced today, pre-orders are open and the Fire TV Stick 4K Select will ship next month.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If you’d rather have the Fire TV ecosystem baked into your television, Amazon’s got you covered there. The latest Omni QLED Series models have displays that are 60 percent brighter than previous versions, Amazon says. The TVs adjust their display colors automatically depending on the ambient lighting and can turn on by themselves when they detect your presence. The TV can also display your photos or artwork and switch off when you exit the room. The Omni QLED Series TV come in 50-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch variants and start at $480.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Omnisense feature is available on the latest 2-Series Fire TV models too.

The Blink Arc looks quite odd, almost like a pair of goggles. It houses two Blink Mini 2K+ cameras and combines the footage into “a single, seamlessly stitched feed.” If you have a Blink Plus subscription, you’ll have access to a 180-degree view.

It identifies known faces, so Ring will be able to notify you when they’re at your door (or if someone unfamiliar is there). That’s coming in December too.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There’s another new feature called Search Party, which Amazon says is about helping people find lost dogs. When a neighbor reports a missing pooch in the Ring app, a Search Party commences on nearby Ring cameras. These will keep a look out and notify camera owners if they spot what may be the missing dog. The camera owner will then see a photo of the pet alongside relevant camera footage, and can then choose whether to alert the dog’s owner.

This works for live sports as well, so you can find out stats and other nuggets about what you’re watching on Prime Video, Sling TV, DirecTV and Fubo. </p><p style="text-align:left;">On the new Echo Show devices, there’s an Alexa+ shopping widget. From here, you’ll be able to keep tabs on your Amazon, Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh deliveries; access detailed info on products; and re-order items with a voice command or a tap. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Amazon claims Alexa+ can help you figure out what gift to get someone based on responses to questions it asks you. The assistant will offer personalized recommendations from Amazon.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexa+ is going to hook into all manner of devices and services. Through the Alexa+ Store (which will be available soon), you’ll be able to access services from the likes of TaskRabbit, Fandango, Priceline, Uber, Lyft, Thumbtack, GrubHub and Yahoo Sports. You can manage your various Amazon subscriptions via Alexa+ too.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In addition, Alexa+ is coming to speakers, TVs and in-car systems from other brands. Those include Bose, Sonos, LG, Samsung and BMW.  </p><p style="text-align:left;">As things stand, Alexa+ is currently free with Prime. Non-Prime members can use it for $20 per month — but you may as well pay $15 per month or $139 per year for Prime if you really, <em>really </em>want access to Alexa+.</p><h2 style="text-align:left;" id="c6ae151b-0e44-43a0-b175-c5be55d63c2f">Smart remote</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/3e14b4f0-9e1d-11f0-89be-33b67c5a76a3" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/3e14b4f0-9e1d-11f0-89be-33b67c5a76a3" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="undefined" data-uuid="05aa8798-4588-3182-ac2c-d633dcc2fc07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p style="text-align:left;">Amazon had another product to unveil today, but this one wasn’t highlighted during the event.

Both are available to pre-order starting today, with shipping to start on October 29. The Dot Max costs $100 — well above the standard Dot (which remains available) — while the Studio is priced at $220.</p> 
<p>The Echo Dot Max looks to be Amazon’s answer to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652-140043737.html">Apple’s HomePod mini</a>, which is similarly compact yet touts quality sound for its size. The company says the new speaker offers “nearly three times” as much bass response as the cheaper Echo Dot. That’s largely because it’s been redesigned on the inside to include two speakers — a woofer and a custom tweeter — instead of one and to increase the amount of internal air space.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The new Echo Studio, meanwhile, gets a fairly major design overhaul. It essentially looks like a bigger version of Echo Dot Max, with the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-echo-studio-review.html">old cylindrical design</a> replaced by a spherical shape. Amazon says it’s 40 percent smaller than the last one, with the goal being to make it easier to stick the device in varying locations around the house. This one is built with three full-range drivers alongside a woofer, and it supports both Dolby Atmos and spatial audio with services that offer that (such as Apple Music).</p>

<p>The Studio’s smaller footprint could be handy if you want to take advantage of the new Alexa Home Theater mode. This lets you turn up to five new Echo Studios or Echo Dot Maxes into a surround sound setup for your TV, sort of like an Alexa-fied version of the room calibration tech Sonos offers with its home speakers. If you have compatible gear, Amazon says the voice assistant will automatically locate the different speakers in your room and map out an appropriate acoustic profile. An Amazon representative told us that you need a Fire TV Stick 4K or 4K Max streamer for this to work for now, however, since Alexa uses your TV’s location to determine where the front of the surround system is, then uses that in tandem with your speakers’ locations to estimate where you’re sitting. This whole process takes “less than five minutes,” according to the company, and it’ll auto-adjust if you add in more speakers. You won’t be able to mix and match Studios and Dot Maxes in one setup at launch, however — it has to be all of one speaker or the other.</p> 
<p>I was briefly able to check out and listen to the new speakers at the event through a controlled demo. I wouldn’t say either looks particularly “premium” at first blush, but the spherical designs are clean and simple, and the knitted fabric surrounding the hardware feels firm and sturdy. Neither strays <em>too</em> far from the traditional Echo aesthetic; you could pop them on a counter or TV stand and they won’t draw much attention to themselves. Of note, the volume/mic control buttons and Alexa light ring are now angled on the front of each device, which may make quickly adjusting things a little bit quicker.</p> 
<p>As for how the two speakers actually sound, I have to reiterate that my demo was highly controlled, i.e. orchestrated to make the new speakers sound as good as possible. I wasn’t able to pick a song, adjust volume or actually talk to Alexa myself. (Though Amazon says there are new chips and mic arrays to improve conversation detection.)</p>

<p>With that said, the Echo Dot Max did indeed produce more bass thump and clearer separation than the cheaper Dot in a side-by-side comparison using Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams.” It better, given the price, but it sounded far less “closed-off” all the same. The Echo Studio was a marked step up from there, producing a much wider soundstage, more impactful bass and more natural highs. Again, take all of this with a grain of salt, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we said it’s worth the premium for audio-focused buyers when we test it ourselves. An Amazon rep said this new Studio model isn’t noticeably louder than the last one — — though that’s not surprising given how much more compact it is — the focus is on making a smaller frame and a “richer” sound. To that end, both devices <em>seemed</em> to go for a slightly more bass-heavy profile than a neutral one, based on my limited listen.</p> 
<p>I was also able to demo four Echo Studios paired in tandem. Predictably, this setup filled the room with sound and delivered more precise imaging, whether we were listening to an ambient soundscape of birds chirping in the woods or an action-heavy scene from <em>Ready Player One</em>. I do question the value, though: You’re getting close to the $1,000 range with four of these things, and at that point, many people may be better off just getting a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html">decent soundbar</a> and a dedicated subwoofer for fuller bass.</p> 
<p>Naturally, Amazon says both speakers — along with the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazon-just-announced-a-totally-redesigned-echo-show-8-and-echo-show-11-145937172.html">new Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11</a> — are designed with Alexa+ in mind, and anyone who buys either device will be able to use the upgraded assistant in early access. Both are still likely to be more niche than the less expensive Echoes, given that many people still use these things for simpler smart home tasks and basic listening. But for those who’ve grown accustomed having an Echo around the house and are willing to pay for improved sound quality, there may be enough to like here. We’ll know more clearly when we’re able to test them on our own.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imgur has shut off its image-hosting platform for users in the UK, displaying a “content not available in your region” notice across the site and on third-party embeds. The move comes after the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/09/statement-update-on-imgur-investigation/"><ins>warned</ins></a> that it intended to levy fines against Imgur’s owner, MediaLab AI, after an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/02/investigations-announced-into-how-social-media-and-video-sharing-platforms-use-uk-children-s-personal-information/"><ins>investigation</ins></a> into the service&#39;s handling of children’s data, age verification and privacy protection. Exact details of the fine, or what the findings of the investigation were, have not been shared.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware of reports that the social media platform Imgur is currently not available in the UK. Imgur&#39;s decision to restrict access in the UK is a commercial decision taken by the company,&quot; said regulators in a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/09/statement-update-on-imgur-investigation/"><ins>statement</ins></a>. They also stressed that &quot;exiting the UK&quot; does not mean a company can avoid any levied penalties, and that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Our findings are provisional and the ICO will carefully consider any representations from MediaLab before taking a final decision whether to issue a monetary penalty,&quot; said regulators.</p>
<p>In recent years, the ICO has stepped up enforcement of its policies governing data privacy for minors. In 2023, the watchdog fined TikTok $15.8 million for what it said were several violations of data protection laws. The regulator alleged that in 2020 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-privacy-watchdog-fines-tiktok-158-million-for-misusing-kids-data-143046278.html"><ins>TikTok allowed</ins></a> as many as 1.4 million children under the age of 13 to use the app, against its own policies. TikTok found itself under <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/uk-watchdog-investigates-chidrens-safety-on-tiktok-and-reddit-153052793.html"><ins>investigation yet again</ins></a> this year over similar alleged violations. The ICO also previously raised concerns surrounding a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-says-snaps-ai-chatbot-may-put-kids-privacy-at-risk-145413931.html"><ins>Snapchat generative AI chatbot</ins></a> named My AI, alleging that it placed children&#39;s privacy at risk.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/imgur-has-left-the-uk-181715724.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Avalanche Studios is following in the footsteps of so many game developers this year. Today, the company posted a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update"><ins>notice</ins></a> to its website announcing plans for a restructuring. Avalanche said it will close its studio in Liverpool, impacting all staff members in the city. The company said it will also &quot;reduce our workforce and restructure the teams&quot; at its studios in Malmo and Stockholm, but did not provide specifics about the scope of those layoffs.</p>
<p>Although the statement simply credited the decision to &quot;current challenges to our business and the industry,&quot; it&#39;s hard not to think that the cancellation of Avalanche&#39;s planned game <em>Contraband</em> had something to do with the current need to consolidate. Microsoft <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-has-ended-active-development-on-contraband-175333930.html"><ins>ended</ins></a> active development on the project in August during the fallout from the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-percent-of-its-global-workforce-154755787.html"><ins>massive</ins></a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html"><ins>layoffs</ins></a> the tech giant announced over the spring and summer. Those cuts appeared to impact the fate of many other upcoming games and game studios that were working with Microsoft as either a developer or a publisher.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since we won&#39;t get to know them for <em>Contraband</em>, Avalanche Studios will remain best known for its Just Cause games of open-world mayhem for now. <em>Contraband</em> is the only game currently listed as a forthcoming title on the company website, so it&#39;s unclear what the next moves for the remaining team members will be. The notice closes by saying, &quot;Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.&quot; Hopefully they&#39;ll be able to bounce back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/just-cause-developer-avalanche-studios-is-the-latest-game-company-to-announce-layoffs-180048615.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a couple years since the Echo 8 has gotten an update and even longer for the aging Echo Show 10. But today Amazon is fixing that with two brand-new smart displays: The fourth-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11.</p> 
<p>Right away, the first thing you notice about Amazon's refreshed lineup is their designs. In front, there's a slim tablet-based HD display (either 8.7 inches or 11 inches depending on the model). Around back there's a curvier housing covered in a mesh fabric for the display's internals and speakers that borrows a lot from the new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-reveals-an-updated-echo-studio-speaker-with-a-new-chip-and-upgraded-drivers-150303898.html">Echo Studio</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazons-new-echo-dot-max-is-a-smart-speaker-for-alexa-150222265.html">Echo Dot Max</a>. This is a pretty big departure from Amazon's wedge-shaped predecessors and I think it's a success. Both models look more elegant and refined, while their rounded bases make it easier to angle them properly in whatever room they're in.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>That said, while both models feature new 13MP cameras with auto-framing tech (meaning they can track your face if you need to move around the room while on a video call), neither version has a built-in motor that would allow the entire display to rotate and spin like you got on the old Echo Show 10. I suspect this is a tacit admission by Amazon that a movable display is a bit of a gimmick, at least on a smart display. Or it's just not super necessary when you can just have the device's camera re-compose your video framing dynamically in software.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, there are a few handy physical controls for volume located on the right side of the Echo Shows' displays along with a toggle for disabling the onboard mics and camera. Aside from that, there's a single barrel plug in back for power (which is slightly annoying, I wish it was USB-C) and not much else. So if for some reason you want to connect the new Echo Shows to wired internet, you're going to need to get pretty creative.&nbsp;</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9516221d-3e13-4157-b7ce-c39f7d358e91" /> 
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see how the audio on the new Echo Show models compares to the refreshed Echo Studio or Dot Max. However, Amazon's updated displays are a big improvement. They have huge viewing angles so it's never hard to see what's on the screen from wherever your standing. And while Amazon hasn't provided official brightness figures, based on what I've seen, the panels are rather vibrant, so there shouldn't be any major issues viewing things in sunny rooms.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon's refreshed UI is also rather straightforward. All you need is a couple taps or swipes to open things like the video tab, music controls, settings and a list of upcoming calendar events. Meanwhile, the addition of Amazon's AZ3 Pro chip has greatly improved the responsiveness of touch and gesture input to the point where it felt a bit faster than the Google Nest Hub Max I have at home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the real impact of the new Echo Shows is yet to be seen, because while updated hardware is nice, the real value of these smart displays is how they are now better positioned to be the center of Amazon's smart home ecosystem. Both devices support Zigbee, Matter and Thread so it should be easy to use them to control other devices, while features like a Wi-Fi radar enables a wider range of contextual interactions from Alexa. And while I think the ability to create routines and automations strictly using your voice is a major upgrade for the average user, I wasn't able to test that functionality out myself at the event.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The other potential omission is that while Amazon's two largest smart displays got much needed refreshes today, the same can't be said for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">Echo Show 5</a>. So while that model continues to be on sale, I wouldn't be surprised if it got discontinued when supply runs out or re-imagined as something closer to a smart alarm clock sometime in the future, as it's smaller screen makes it's role as a smart home hub a bit more limited.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new Echo Show ($180) and Echo Show 11 ($220) are available for pre-order today and will come with early access to Alexa+ before official sales begin on November 12.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, that was fast. One day after <em>Wired</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-reportedly-release-a-tiktok-like-social-app-alongside-sora-2-205842527.html">reported that OpenAI</a> was preparing to release a new AI social video app, the company has revealed it to the wider world. It's called the Sora app, and it's powered by OpenAI's new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">Sora 2 video model</a>, allowing it to generate AI-made clips of nearly anything. As expected, the app's signature "cameo" feature allows people to add your likeness to videos they generate.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="4e38469ddfc2463985fd5d80154619f1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEcg6AJ6DVY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Cameos are likely to be controversial, even if OpenAI is giving users a lot of control over whether someone can replicate their likeness in clips Sora generates. When you first start using the app, you can allow your friends (and even strangers) permission to generate images of you. Whenever someone uses your likeness in a video Sora will designate you as the "co-owner" of that clip, allowing you to later delete it or prevent others from further modifying the video with subsequent generations. The latter plays into Sora's "Remix" feature, which allows users to jump on trending videos to offer their own take on them. Sora 2 can generate sound alongside video, a first for OpenAI's model.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately of the above restrictions, Sora can't generate videos of public figures — unless they upload their likeness to the app and grant their friends or everyone permission to use it in their creations — and the software will refuse to make pornographic content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, Sora is only <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d35ad296-2096-4487-b75f-22f359884afa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=available+on+iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9zb3JhLWJ5LW9wZW5haS9pZDY3NDQwMzQwMjgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQzNWFkMjk2LTIwOTYtNDQ4Ny1iNzVmLTIyZjM1OTg4NGFmYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvc29yYS1ieS1vcGVuYWkvaWQ2NzQ0MDM0MDI4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAc9qrRD6UzqpLx56d6qfbpTq8v8DF6r7Y-qB-pUaIdRr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fsora-by-openai%2Fid6744034028" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d35ad296-2096-4487-b75f-22f359884afa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=available+on+iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9zb3JhLWJ5LW9wZW5haS9pZDY3NDQwMzQwMjgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQzNWFkMjk2LTIwOTYtNDQ4Ny1iNzVmLTIyZjM1OTg4NGFmYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvc29yYS1ieS1vcGVuYWkvaWQ2NzQ0MDM0MDI4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAc9qrRD6UzqpLx56d6qfbpTq8v8DF6r7Y-qB-pUaIdRr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fsora-by-openai%2Fid6744034028&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl&amp;uuid=bPwW5mA4WiYIjpUO2563">available on iOS</a>, with no word yet on when it might arrive on Android, and you'll need an invite from the company. However, those lucky few who can join are able to invite four friends to download the software, much like the early days of say, Bluesky or Clubhouse (lol). OpenAI is only making Sora available to people in the US and Canada (sorry, everyone else).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The survival climbing game <em>Cairn</em> has been delayed until the first quarter of 2026. Development studio The Game Bakers had previously announced a release date for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/survival-climber-cairn-ascends-to-ps5-and-pc-on-november-5-215529242.html"><ins>November 5 of this year</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The delay is so the team can spend more time on &quot;optimization, debug and polish.&quot; Creative director Emeric Thoa said that &quot;after 5 years of work, it makes no sense to rush it&quot; as &quot;we want to be proud of the game we launch.&quot; Delays are never fun, but they are a whole lot better than <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-24-broken-video-games.html"><ins>buying a broken game at launch</ins></a>.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have an actual release date yet, but the game&#39;s still coming to both PC and PS5. There is a demo available, which has racked up 600,000 players on both platforms. The Game Bakers are beefing up that demo on October 13, adding ghost recordings of speedrunners and staffers. The company says these ghosts can be followed to &quot;check new techniques or discover new routes and hidden areas.&quot; Mario Kart and other racing games have been doing something similar for years.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Cairn</em> is a tough-as-nails rock-climbing game with a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/climbing-game-cairn-will-have-a-free-solo-mode-with-no-rope-213450638.html"><ins>free solo mode for added difficulty</ins></a>. There&#39;s no UI feedback, so players have to pay attention to the avatar&#39;s breathing and body language. It feels like a more intense cousin of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-relaxing-video-games-140048572.html"><ins>peaceful </ins><em><ins>Jusant</ins></em></a>, which is another rock-climbing sim.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/survival-climbing-game-cairn-has-been-delayed-until-2026-171512591.html?src=rss]]></description>

Though it didn't get mentioned during the company's <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html">Devices and Services event</a> earlier today, there is a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D8KF4HRQ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=43419ae6-3693-45ce-8e00-0bad44c470d6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=new+Smart+Remote&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDhLRjRIUlE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDM0MTlhZTYtMzY5My00NWNlLThlMDAtMGJhZDQ0YzQ3MGQ2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDhLRjRIUlEiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYhW0JT-_ymNdWbONK0LiioveHYHAn1qFrUE-MlRwyAK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D8KF4HRQ" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8KF4HRQ">new Smart Remote</a> under the Amazon Basics brand that will be available for pre-order for $19.99 and will ship in October. According to the product listing page, it will be released on October 30.</p> 
<p>At first glance, the Smart Remote looks like a regular switch that you mount on your wall to control your lights or other appliances. Its full name on Amazon's current pre-order page even says it's a "Smart Dimmer Switch and Remote." It basically has four buttons that you can configure via the Alexa app or ask Alexa+ to map routines to. During a demo at the event space, an Amazon representative told an Echo Show "Alexa, when I press the top button I want you to activate the party time scene and play "Alive" by Pearl Jam.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The assistant acknowledged the request and within 10 seconds said it had completed the task. The rep pressed a button and lights in the demo room came on, while the song started playing on the Echo Show.</p> 
<p>You can also use the Routines section of Amazon's app to customize what you want the device to do. In the same demo, the company also showed how the assistant can suggest routines based on your habits. It can also remind you to, say, take out the trash if you've connected a Ring camera and it's noticed patterns in which day of the week your garbage is removed from the street.</p> 
<p>The battery-powered remote can be mounted on a wall or surface and can be magnetically attached for maximum convenience. Though a simple remote might not be the most exciting thing, especially at an event where Amazon's voice assistant and AI were so widely talked about, it's still something people might find useful. Particularly if you want to just press a button to trigger a series of actions instead of finding the exact words to say in the precise pronunciation that is required to be understood by your smart speaker.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">What good is an update if it doesn’t actually add anything new? That’s the question I’m left asking about Microsoft’s Windows 11 2025 update (AKA Windows 11 25H2), which the company will begin pushing out today. Instead of adding any major new capabilities, Microsoft says it’s an “enablement package” that includes recent features added to last year’s 24H2 release. If anything, it could be a push for stragglers who’ve ignored recent updates to get onboard with new Windows 11 capabilities. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Microsoft says the Windows 11 2025 update also “includes significant advancements in build and runtime vulnerability detection, coupled with AI assisted secure coding.” Additionally, the new update should be leaner than before, thanks to the removal of PowerShell 2.0 and Windows Management instrumentation command-line (WMIC). Those are legacy features most users have never touched, but their removal could annoy power users and IT admins who have built ancient scripts using PowerShell 2.0.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As usual, Microsoft says it will start delivering the Windows 11 2025 update to users in waves. The first batch includes users with 24H2 devices who’ve turned on “Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available” in Windows Update. Now that Microsoft has moved to a frequent update cadence, you can expect to see actual new features for Windows 11 25H2 arriving in the coming months.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsofts-windows-11-2025-update-starts-rolling-out-today-but-dont-expect-anything-new-170005064.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may not be looking to spend big on tech this <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">October Prime Day</a>, but it's still a good idea to look for tech essentials during the shopping event while you can get some at good discounts. Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it.<br><br>For example, in sales past, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. My partner will likely be upgrading to an iPhone 17 this year, so we'll have to get a few more USB-C cables now that Lightning is officially banished from our home. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up the year before — but one can never have too many. Here, we've collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging gear we could find, and we'll update this post as the event goes on with the latest offerings.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-anker-prime-day-deals-power-banks">Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks</h2> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">Power banks</a> are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-anker-prime-day-deals-wireless-chargers">Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers</h2> 
<p>A good <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html">wireless charger</a> can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up.</p> 
<p>We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-anker-prime-day-deals-charging-gear">Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear</h2> 
<p>Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.</p>

<p>This model features motion detection, privacy zones, color night vision and Live View with two-way talk, among other features. Installation is a breeze since you don't have to hardwire it to your existing doorbell wiring. Most users report that the battery lasts between several weeks and several months depending on how users set up the video doorbell, with power-heavy features like motion detection consuming more battery life.</p> 
<p>With most video doorbells today, you need a subscription to get the most out of them, and Ring is no exception.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-30/spotify-announcement-daniel-ek-executive-chairman/"><ins>will be transitioning</ins></a> to the role of executive chairman on January 1 of next year. The current Co-President and Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström and Co-President and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström will take his place as co-CEOs.</p>
<p>“Over the last few years, I’ve turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav — who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase. This change simply matches titles to how we already operate. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will focus on the long arc of the company and keep the Board and our co-CEOs deeply connected through my engagement,&quot; Ek said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-30/spotify-announcement-daniel-ek-executive-chairman/"><ins>statement</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a letter to Spotify employees, Ek also shared that he wants to help create more technology-driven &quot;supercompanies&quot; that &quot;tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time.&quot;</p>
<p>As a recent example of Ek&#39;s other interests, this summer he led a $700 million investment round into the defense tech firm Helsing. The company sells AI-powered software that analyzes weapons and sensor data in battlefields to help with military decision-making. Last year Helsing started manufacturing a line of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://helsing.ai/newsroom/helsing-unveils-intelligent-strike-drone-for-mass-and-precision"><ins>military drones</ins></a>. Ek has <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5522297/musicians-leaving-spotify-protest-hotline-tnt-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard#:~:text=Over%20the%20summer%2C%20a%20slew,with%20indie%20rock%20quartet%20Deerhoof"><ins>received pushback</ins></a> on this investment in the form of a number of smaller artists, as well as Massive Attack <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/sylvan-esso-pulling-catalog-spotify-1236078516/"><ins>pulling their music catalogs</ins></a> from Spotify.</p>
<p>Daniel Ek founded Spotify in 2006 alongside Martin Lorentzon and oversaw the company&#39;s growth to almost 700 million monthly active listeners. It&#39;s been a busy year for the music streaming giant, which finally started offering <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-lossless-streaming-is-finally-here-and-its-included-with-a-premium-plan-131009528.html"><ins>lossless streaming</ins></a> after a multi-year wait.</p>
<p>The company also finds itself at a crossroads as more <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/ai-band-the-velvet-sundown-confirm-ai-1235379354/">AI-generated music</a> is making its way to the platform. The company recently made <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html">some policy changes</a> to address AI, though this was only aimed at fraudulent and deceptive uses of the technology. Fully AI-generated songs and albums are still permitted.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/daniel-ek-is-stepping-down-as-spotify-ceo-161519791.html?src=rss]]></description>

The latest smart-home screens were built to showcase <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-at-amazons-2025-event-greetings-and-more-143211291.html">Alexa+</a>, the new and AI-improved smart assistant.</p> 
<p>There's a new Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11 (as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-reveals-an-updated-echo-studio-speaker-with-a-new-chip-and-upgraded-drivers-150303898.html">new Echo speakers</a>). Amazon called them the most powerful Echo devices ever created. They have custom silicon, the AZ3 Pro with an AI Accelerator, as well as more advanced sensors and improved microphones for better noise cancellation. The look has been completely redesigned, and resembles a cross between the existing Echo Show 8 and the Echo Show 10, with a prominent speaker module at the bottom and floating screen up top. The speakers pack full-range drivers that fire audio forwards for clearer sound.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Both of the new displays have negative liquid crystal screens designed to maximize viewing angles, so you can see them better from anywhere in a room. They each have 13MP cameras as well, which is the best camera ever included on an Echo Show. That and other sensors, including Wi-Fi radar, will enable contextualized Alexa+ interactions, like recognizing when you walk up to the display, triggering the AI to greet you, display your relevant information and even deliver one of your personalized reminders.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Software upgrades include a new media control center to allow better access to your video and music and streaming apps. A new home hub has support for Zigbee, Matter and Thread, which should let you hook up even more smart home devices for Alexa to tap into. If you use your display for family scheduling, you can try the new color-coded calendars. If you wear an Oura ring, look for new wellness integrations centered around that fitness tracker. A new Alexa+ shopping widget will give you more control over your Amazon and Whole Foods deliveries while also suggesting items to buy and even gifts to give someone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Echo Show 8 and Show 11 were redesigned with Alexa+ in mind, the service that Amazon revealed at an <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-announced-at-amazons-alexa-ai-event-164613305.html">event earlier this year</a>. The AI-enhanced upgrade to Amazon's virtual assistant is supposed to be more conversational, retaining memories of your chats for more contextualized responses. Our <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">experience with an early version</a> of the assistant was… complicated. It was better at many things like multi-step tasks and using information from previous interactions, but it, like all AI-experiences, highlighted the limitations of computers trying to be people. Alexa+ is currently free with Prime, or costs $20 per month for non-Prime members.</p> 
<p>Prior to the announcement of the new display, the Echo Show lineup consisted of four models: The Echo Show 5, 8, 15 and 21 (the Echo Show 10 hasn’t been consistently available these past few months). Each model number refers to the size of the screen (measured on the diagonal) and the smallest, the Echo Show 5, is designed for office desks or small kitchens. The older Show 8 was more suited to acting as a smart home hub and, like the Echo Show 5, designed to sit on a table or countertop. Both were last updated in 2023. The Show 15 and 21 are wall-mountable and can act as calendars and family planners in addition to subbing in as small TVs when needed. The two larger Show displays were last updated in 2024.</p> 
<p>The new Echo Show devices are available for pre-order today and will come with Alexa+ Early Access. The Echo Show 8 sells for $180 and the and Echo Show 11 for $220. Both will ship on November 12.&nbsp;</p>

As the name implies, Alexa Home Theater works with up to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-reveals-an-updated-echo-studio-speaker-with-a-new-chip-and-upgraded-drivers-150303898.html">five of its new Echo Studio or Echo Dot Max</a> devices to create a surround sound environment with the Fire TV Stick 4K or 4K Max. According to the company, Alexa will automatically set up the Home Theater feature once you’ve plugged in several Echo devices.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clearly, Amazon isn’t aiming for the home theater enthusiast crowd here. A surround sound system without a subwoofer simply won’t sound very exciting. But if you’re going for a fairly minimalist setup, I could see how having a few Echo orbs around your living room could be more aesthetically pleasing than giant speakers. Unfortunately,  Alexa Home Theater won’t work with the original Echo Studio, Amazon representatives confirmed today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">While the company is pitching this feature as an inexpensive entry into surround sound, a full Alexa Home Theater setup will start at $500 for five Echo Dot Max speakers, and it’ll get even pricier once you throw in the $220 Echo Studio. At that point, just <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html">get a decent soundbar</a>, which will be able to virtualize surround sound and offer better low-end.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-will-let-you-use-amazons-echo-speakers-for-surround-sound-153325469.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before it began slowly trickling out Alexa+ to users at the start of February, Amazon <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-a-smarter-more-conversational-ai-version-of-amazons-digital-assistant-154349563.html">promised a smarter, more conversational assistant</a>. It turned out the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">reality was more complicated</a>, and, more than anything, Alexa+ in its current state is a showcase of the limitations of generative AI. Of course, that&#39;s not stopping Amazon from iterating on the digital assistant. During its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html">&quot;Devices and Services&quot; event</a> on Tuesday, Amazon announced a host of Alexa+ updates, with many of them enabling new integrations alongside the company&#39;s brand new devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of those new features is Alexa+ Greetings, which will roll out to Ring&#39;s new 2K and 4K devices <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-camera-4k-home-security">this December</a>. With the help of Ring&#39;s image recognition technology, Alexa+ will be able to make decisions about how to handle different visitors to your home. If it sees one of your friends or family members, it will know to greet them. Conversely, the digital assistant will ask questions of strangers to determine the purpose of their visit. It can also manage deliveries by providing instructions to couriers about where to leave a package.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alexa+ is also built <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-unveils-a-new-fire-tv-lineup-including-the-40-fire-tv-stick-4k-select-144541988.html">directly into Vega</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-fire-tv-alexa-plus-fire-tv-stick">Amazon&#39;s new smart TV operating system</a>. The integration will translate into more personalized recommendations, and the ability for Alexa+ to show you content related to your questions. For example, you can use the assistant to find a specific scene in a movie. In the demo Amazon showed, Vice President of Fire TV Aidan Marcuss instructed Alexa to &quot;find the scene where Hatteburg hits a home run,&quot; and the assistant pulled up the appropriate spot in the film <em>Moneyball</em>. This functionality will be available while watching live sports too, meaning you can ask the assistant for updates on your favorite teams and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over on the Kindle side of things, you&#39;ll be able to send notes and documents you have stored on your Kindle <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-adds-the-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-and-scribe-3-to-its-writing-tablet-lineup-145031938.html">Colorsoft or Scribe 3</a> to Alexa+. This feature will allow you to have a conversation about the contents of those files with the digital assistant, with the integration slated to arrive sometime early next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the place you&#39;re most likely to interact with Alexa+ is when using an Echo device. Amazon is billing the refreshed 2025 Echo line — made up of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazons-new-echo-dot-max-is-a-smart-speaker-for-alexa-150222265.html">Echo Dot Max</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-reveals-an-updated-echo-studio-speaker-with-a-new-chip-and-upgraded-drivers-150303898.html">Echo Studio</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazon-just-announced-a-totally-redesigned-echo-show-8-and-echo-show-11-145937172.html">Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11</a> — as &quot;designed for Alexa+&quot;. To that end, the company has equipped all of the new devices with two new chips, the AZ3 and AZ3 Pro. The silicon is faster and offers better voice processing, with Amazon claiming Alexa+ is over 50 percent better at detecting when you go to wake it. At the same time, there are new third-party integrations, with some notable partners including Fandango, Uber and Lyft. All of these will be found in the new Alexa+ Store where you&#39;ll be able to see the assistant&#39;s growing list of capabilities. If you would rather use a speaker from a different brand, Amazon said Bose, Sonos and Samsung, among others, are working to bring Alexa+ to their devices. Automakers like BMW are doing the same with their cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a new Alexa+ shopping widget will allow you to keep track of your Amazon, Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh purchases, including any deliveries you have scheduled. Naturally, Alexa+ can search the entire Amazon catalog and answer questions about any products you might want to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the new Echo devices Amazon announced today will ship with early access to Alexa+ out of the box. You can pre-order all four today, with general availability of the Echo Dot Max and Echo Studio to follow on October 29, while the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11 are slated to arrive on November 12.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-at-amazons-2025-event-greetings-and-more-143211291.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to new Echo speakers, Amazon rarely shows something that will appeal to customers who crave premium sound quality. The last time it did, it debuted the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-echo-studio-review.html">Echo Studio</a>, which could handle immersive Dolby Atmos and double as a home theater speaker. At its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/everything-announced-at-amazons-fall-hardware-event-143557140.html">hardware event</a> in NYC today, Amazon unveiled <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-new-echo-devices-alexa-plus">an updated Echo Studio</a> with new drivers, a new chip and an all-new design.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon says the new model offers "incredible high fidelity sound" thanks to three full-range drivers and an excursion woofer for maximum bass. Like the original Studio, this speaker is designed for Dolby Atmos content, which is available across both movies and music. There's a new AZ23 Pro chip inside as well, silicon that's built to power audio features and Alexa+ on the new Studio. Amazon says the component offers advanced speech and audio processing — as well as visual processing on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazon-just-announced-a-totally-redesigned-echo-show-8-and-echo-show-11-145937172.html">the new Echo Show lineup</a>.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The company also updated the Echo Studio design, ditching the large cylinder for the more spherical shape. The blueish light ring for Alexa is now on the front instead of the top. The controls are now on the front as well, where you'll find buttons for volume and muting the microphones. Overall, the new Echo Studio is 40 percent smaller than the original and is now covered in a 3D knit fabric for acoustic transparency.</p> 
<p>Amazon also announced Alexa Home Theater during its reveal of the Echo Studio. This feature allows you to connect up to five Echo Studio or <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazons-new-echo-dot-max-is-a-smart-speaker-for-alexa-150222265.html">Echo Dot Max</a> devices to create a more immersive sound setup. The company promises that you'll simply plug in the speakers and Alexa will handle the rest. The assistant will use OmniSense to automatically tune the speakers based on their position, the size of the room and the space's acoustic characteristics. As you might expect, Amazon plans to sell these new speakers in Alexa Home Theater bundles so you don't have to spend too much time shopping for a multi-speaker system.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new Echo Studio is available for pre-order today for $220, and early adopters will get Alexa+ Early Access with the purchase. The new speaker will ship on October 29.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has seen the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-at-amazons-2025-event-greetings-and-more-143211291.html">power and potential of Alexa+</a>, its AI-powered smart assistant, and is now launching a raft of devices to support it. Today, at the company's <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html">September 2025 devices event</a>, the company unveiled several new Echo devices, with the Dot Max (pictured, right) leading the pack.</p> 
<p>The Echo Dot Max is a $100 smart speaker designed to occupy every room in your home, complete with the usual smart home bonuses. The major changes inside and out are to ensure it's better able to use Alexa+, which includes new custom silicon, sensors and better sound.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>For instance, Dot Max features two drivers which, when combined, produces three times as much bass as the fifth-generation Echo Dot. The sound, which will adapt to the local space, is apparently so good that Amazon's Daniel Rausch described it as the "most performant" smart speaker at this sort of price.</p> 
<p>Similarly, new microphones are paired with a new, custom-made AZ3 chip for improved conversation detection and background noise filtering. AZ3 can also harness Amazon's "Omnisense" platform that combines Wi-Fi Radar, audio and its accelerometer to monitor what's going on in your home.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today Amazon held its annual Devices and Services event, debuting its next generation of products. While Amazon isn&#39;t live streaming the event, we&#39;re on the floor sharing everything it announces in our <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html">live blog</a>, including a slew of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-camera-4k-home-security">new Ring products and features</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take Ring&#39;s Retinal Vision, rolling out across its new line of 2K and 4K doorbells and cameras. It offers back-side illumination sensors and 10x zoom for clear vision, even in low light. Ring pairs these features with custom large aperture lenses that it claims will capture more light and maintain sharpness throughout the frame.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Retinal Vision also &quot;optimizes every step of the imaging process with advanced AI tuning,&quot; according to Ring. Basically, it will alter your camera&#39;s clarity based on its location. Ring will use AI to sample your camera&#39;s quality across up to two weeks, multiple times a day. Then, it will do a &quot;final optimization&quot; that should provide the best video for your location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retinal 4K Vision will be available on the all-new Wired Doorbell Pro, Spotlight Cam Pro, Floodlight Cam Pro and Outdoor Cam Pro. There are also three power over Ethernet devices, Power over Ethernet devices: the Spotlight Cam Pro POE, Outdoor Cam Pro POE and Wired Doorbell Elite. Whereas Retinal 2K Vision is coming to the all-new Indoor Cam Plus and Wired Doorbell Plus. These devices are available to pre-order today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond 2K and 4K retinal techology, Ring is also introducing Alexa+ Greetings, an intelligent doorbell attendant. It will basically do the hard work of talking to strangers for you. Alexa+ can ask why someone is at your door, give them instructions and manage your deliveries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works hand-in-hand with another new feature called Familiar Faces. This tool allows Ring to recognize your familiar people and let you know exactly who&#39;s at your door. It also lets you limit notifications that come from one of their typical routines, separating them from alerts triggered by an unknown person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alexa+ Greeings and Familiar Faces — both available in December —build on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/rings-ai-video-descriptions-tell-you-whos-doing-what-130048789.html">AI-generated descriptions</a> of your alerts, introduced in June. Jamie Siminoff, founder and gave the example text, &quot;A person is walking up the steps with a black dog&quot; and said the descriptions will be &quot;intentionally concise.&quot; It lets you know exactly who is coming to the door through text, not just that someone&#39;s there. The feature is available for Ring Home Premium subscribers, which costs $20 a month or 200 annually.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s Search Party, which makes your outdoor Ring camera into another lookout for lost pets. If one of your nighbors reports their pet missing in the Ring app, your camera can use AI to identify the animal and send you an alert. However, it wont share any images or videos without your permission. It will start working for lost dogs in November, followed by cats and other pets.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/ring-announces-retinal-4k-vision-and-search-party-for-finding-pets-143314419.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>I was able to briefly check out the three new tablets ahead of the company’s launch event, and was quite impressed at the responsiveness and color saturation on the demo units I saw. Also, Amazon hasn’t given these devices a name that indicates what generation they are, simply calling them the “all-new Kindle Scribe lineup” and adding the Colorsoft label to the color model. To make things easier for this article, I’ll be occasionally referring to these as the Kindle Scribe 3.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The first thing I noticed was the Scribe 3’s shape. I’m used to the slightly thicker bezel along one long side of the display that, on the older Scribes, has been a handy place to grip the device without touching the screen. But it wasn’t just there for my thumb to hold onto. That area was also where Amazon placed many of the Kindle’s components like the processor and memory.</p> 
<p>To reduce the size of the bezel, Amazon’s Kindle vice president Kevin Keith said “we had to engineer basically the electronics to fold behind the display.” The result is a symmetrical-looking device with a barely-there bezel that’s the same size along all sides of the 11-inch display (slightly bigger than its predecessor’s). It weighs 400 grams (or 0.88 pounds), which should make it easier to hold with one hand while taking notes. Keith also said that, at 5.4mm, the new Kindle Scribe is “thinner than the iPhone Air.” I should point out that a lot of tablets are similarly sleek. The 13-inch iPad Pro and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra both have barely-there profiles of 5.1mm, while the 11-inch iPad Pro measures 5.3mm.</p>

<p>Another way Amazon was able to make the latest Scribe so thin and light was by reducing the number of layers in the display. It removed the anti-glare film on the device, using a glare-free display instead, as well as a textured glass that mimics the friction you’d get when putting pen to paper. The company also got rid of a touch layer that was on top of the display before, since it was able to use a screen with integrated touch input support. Keith said that Amazon also considered the size of the casing around the USB port to aid in shrinking the device further.</p> 
<p>On models with front lights (all but the entry-level configuration), Amazon had to use miniaturized LED front lights since there was no longer a chunky bezel to contain them. In addition to making them smaller, the company also doubled the number of bulbs to ensure consistency of lighting across the page.</p> 
<p>I couldn’t help reaching for the new Kindle Scribe when I saw it, mostly because it looks a lot different than its predecessor. I already found the original Scribe satisfyingly svelte and this latest model is similarly attractive. I do wonder if I might miss having something to grip onto that isn’t the screen, but that might not be a problem if Amazon’s palm rejection technology is effective.</p> 
<p>I did notice a slight dullness in the model without the LED front lights, but it remained as easy to read as an older Kindle. The other two certainly looked a lot brighter, with the higher contrast making onscreen text and drawings look fresher and more vibrant. I’ll get to the Colorsoft model in a bit, but I appreciated how clear and saturated colors appeared on its screen.</p> 
<p>One of my favorite updates this year is magnets. Specifically, the magnets holding Amazon’s stylus to the Scribe itself have gotten stronger. Keith said “we added more magnetic force so that it’s harder to fall off,” and when I tried pulling the pen off the tablet it required noticeably more effort than with previous models. It also snapped back on more easily. Considering this was one of my complaints about the older Scribes, I’m very encouraged to see this improvement.</p> 
<p>The stylus itself has also been refined, with a slightly thicker, rounded silhouette that Keith said is “a little bit more ergonomic.” It still has a rubberized top that works as a digital eraser and when I used it on the new Scribe I felt the urge to brush off eraser dust, just like I did with the predecessors. The programmable action button remains present as well.</p> 
<p>Inside the new Kindle Scribes sit a new custom chip and more memory. Amazon also added the oxide display from its Paperwhite reader, and together with the new processor, that brings a “40 percent faster overall experience with page turning,” according to Keith. The response rate also makes a significant difference in writing, which on the new Kindle Scribe is now down to under 12 milliseconds. That enables a much smoother writing experience with barely noticeable delay between putting the nib on the screen and the digital ink appearing, and because of the changes to the display, any parallax effect is “virtually gone.”</p> 
<p>During the few moments I had to scribble on the new Kindle Scribe, I found it hard to tell if there was a big improvement in fluidity or parallax effects compared to the previous models. It’s about as responsive as before, perhaps just a touch faster at showing what I’ve written. Without a side-by-side comparison, it’s not something I can evaluate right now.</p> 
<p>I will say that I found the latest Scribe a lot easier to hold with one hand, even in spite of the thinner bezels. That is with the caveat, of course, that I have yet to spend more than a minute writing on it. I usually have a hard time writing on the Scribe without a surface on which to prop it up, so I’m curious to see if it’ll be easier to do so with the newest model.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-is-surprisingly-vivid">The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is surprisingly vivid</h2> 
<p>I was able to get a good idea of how the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft’s color rendering compares to some of its competition, though. Every morning, I write three pages of free-flowing thoughts by hand, and I currently do so on <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html">the reMarkable Paper Pro</a>. All my entries include highlighting of the date and time, and my experience with the color rendering on that device has been underwhelming. Technically, I can choose from yellow, green, blue, pink, orange and gray, but honestly I can barely tell the difference between yellow and orange, while blue and gray are also very close. So instead of five usable highlighter shades, I really only have three (gray is barely a hint of a tint).</p> 
<p>The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft not only renders colors more vividly, but hues are more distinct from each other. I’d say the reMarkable Paper Pro is like reading a faded newspaper’s comic strip while the Colorsoft looks more like a glossy graphic novel. It’s still a bit muted, but you can at least see variations in shades.</p> 
<p>Part of what makes the Colorsoft look nice is the fact that the device itself comes in a nice purplish hue that Amazon calls “fig.” With the selection of colors on its screen, I got a very autumnal vibe and was reminded of berries, for some reason. (It’s also possible I was hungry.)</p> 
<p>Like the Kindle Colorsoft that Amazon announced in 2023, the Scribe Colorsoft uses a color filter and LEDs. What’s slightly different is a new rendering engine that Amazon said “enhances the color and ensures writing is fast, fluid and totally natural.”</p> 
<p>While the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft has the same dimensions and weight as its monochrome counterpart, it has a slightly slower response rate of 14ms. I have only written on the Colorsoft so far, and will wait till I can spend more time with both tablets to see if this different latency makes a big difference.</p>

<p>In addition to the new hardware, Amazon also updated the Scribe’s software. All Kindles will be getting a redesigned home page that better surfaces your recently added and edited content. Based on what I saw, instead of having rows of covers on the main screen, there is now a Search bar at the very top, followed by an area on the left half below that for “quick notes.” This is basically a notepad for you to continuously update whenever you need it, so you won’t need to create a new notebook every time you want to jot down a thought. To the right of this top half is the “Jump back into” section, which will show things you were recently working on.</p> 
<p>Below those two portions is a row of titles called “Recently added,” where things you just downloaded into your library will appear. So if you have been reading, say, <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> and just bought <em>Katabasis</em>, you’ll find the first one at the top right and the latter in the “Recently added” section.</p> 
<p>The search bar at the top is now powered by AI, because there is no escaping that. Thankfully, Amazon has been fairly cautious about its approach, which is particularly important for a product like the Kindle Scribe where people go to read and produce original content. The new AI feature here is a smarter search that not only indexes all your handwritten notes, but understands and groups common topics so you can search for something like “What have I told Panos Panay before?” The Scribe will scan your notebooks, find all your relevant scribblings and present everything you’ve written down across all your files and summarize its findings for you.</p> 
<p>I didn’t have time to try this out but I am intrigued at the potential here. I make so many different to-do lists for Engadget’s events coverage that it would be nice to be able to ask “What are the tasks I need to do by the end of October” and possibly get a neatly organized list. The usefulness of this feature depends almost entirely on how intelligent the AI is, so I’ll have to wait till I can review it more thoroughly to say anything more evaluative.</p> 
<p>Amazon is also bringing support for Google Drive and OneDrive, so you can create a folder in either service, add documents to them and the system will download them onto your Kindle Scribe. This is just an easier way to get files onto your Kindle, in addition to sending an email to the associated address or finding a way to add them to your Amazon account. OneNote support is coming as well, and it’ll allow you to export your notes as an embedded image or as a converted text document.</p> 
<p>A “Send to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">Alexa+</a>” feature is coming early next year, so you can share your notes or documents from the Kindle Scribe to the assistant. It will be able to pull information from your pages and remember or refer to them in your conversations, so you can ask it about what’s next on your to-do list or what items are already on your shopping note.</p> 
<p>One more update on the redesigned home page: Instead of the existing “Notebooks” tab, Amazon is rolling out the “Workspace” section. Keith described this as “essentially like a new folder system.” Functionally, it didn’t appear too different from the Notebooks setup, other than making it easier to group your related documents so you can access, say, all the lists you’ve written up for your wedding planning or writing projects.</p> 
<p>The redesigned home page will be launching later this year, and older Kindle devices will be able to update to the new software. The latest generation of Kindle Scribe will be available later this year, with the entry-level model going for $429, the version with the front light costing $499 and the Scribe Colorsoft starting at $629.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Amazon is making </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-amazon-kindle-scribe-color">two additions</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> to its lineup of writing tablets: the Kindle Scribe 3, and the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. The company showed off the new ereaders at its </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">fall hardware event</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> in New York.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is the first time Amazon has added a full-color display to its notebook-like ereader. According to the company, the full-color display is meant to look crisp but "subtle," without the harsh brightness of a typical tablet. The included pen will support writing in 10 different colors and five different shades of highlighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, the new Scribe 3 has been redesigned to be significantly thinner and lighter than its predecessor. At 5.4mm thick, Amazon says it’s meant to have a “paper-like” design. It's also been revamped for a faster writing and page-turning experience. During the event, the company said that writing latency "is down to under 12 milliseconds."</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"> <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The Scribe 3 and Scribe Colorsoft support importing documents from your existing Google Docs and OneDrive accounts. Both tablets come with a new "texture-molded glass" display and a redesigned LED light system at the front of the display. And the display itself has been “rearchitected” to make the writing experience feel more like writing on actual paper than on a tablet. Both Scribes come with an updated processor (Amazon described it as a "quad-core" chip) and increased memory compared with the Scribe 2. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Like last year's </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-hands-on-you-can-scribble-on-your-books-130043335.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Scribe 2</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, both new models will come with a bunch of AI features, including the ability to generate summaries and search through your notes. Amazon also plans to integrate the Scribe devices into its </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Alexa+</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; service so users can ask Alexa questions based on the contents of their notebooks. Amazon is also adding an AI-powered summary feature for ebook readers, called "So Far," that will deliver summaries based on how much of a book you've already read, so you don't have to worry about potential spoilers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The new Kindle Scribe devices go on sale in the United States “later this year” and will be available in the UK and Germany in early 2026. The third-generation Scribe will start at $500 and the Scribe Colorsoft starts at $630. Amazon will also sell a version of the Scribe 3 without a front light for $430.</span></p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It's hard to muster much excitement for Amazon's Fire TV hardware these days — the company's main goal has been to offer cheap TVs and set top boxes for mainstream consumers who haven't been swayed by more compelling offerings from Roku, Apple and Google. Apparently, not much is changing this year, judging from everything announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html">during Amazon’s 2025 device launch event</a>. There’s a new lineup of Fire TV sets, as well as the Fire TV Stick 4K Select, which the company describes as “the fastest streaming stick under $40.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Once again, the star of Amazon’s TV selection is the Fire TV Omni QLED Series, which starts at $480 for the 50-inch model. The company says these new sets offer 60 percent better brightness, almost double the amount of local dimming zones (which helps with contrast and black levels) and a new processor that’s over 40 percent faster. The Omni series can also automatically adjust their settings to deal with lighting changes in your room.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The less exciting Fire TV 2-series and 4-series are 30 percent faster than before, but their main features are their low prices, starting at $160 and $330, respectively. All of Amazon’s new Fire TV sets also feature a new Dialog Boost option, as well as Omnisense, a feature that can automatically turn them on when you <span style="color:rgb(29, 28, 29);font-family:Slack-Lato, Slack-Fractions, appleLogo, sans-serif;">walk in the room (something that reeks of an Orwellian panopticon, much like the rest of Amazon’s Echo speakers and cameras).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Naturally, Amazon’s Fire TV devices are ways to lure you into Amazon’s $20-a-month Alexa+ subscription. With Alexa+, you can ask questions about actors on the screen, or have it suggest movies similar to a show you watched over the weekend. It can also direct you straight to content in Netflix and other services. None of that sounds compelling on its own, but if you have a ton of Echo devices, the AI benefits of Alexa+ might be worth the subscription.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As for the Fire TV Stick 4K Select, Amazon confirmed that it’s running its new Linux-based Vega OS, which replaces the old Android Fire TV software. That’s likely one reason why Amazon was able to bring the cost down to $40.</p>

<p>The latest incarnation of the diminutive Spot was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-revives-the-echo-spot-smart-alarm-clock-and-swiftly-discounts-it-by-44-percent-160304634.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> in July 2024, and while it’s not quite available for its record low price of $45 right now, $50 is pretty close. For that you get a comfortably bedside-sized device with a sharper display than its predecessor, as well as superior sound. The front face is divided into two halves, with a speaker positioned below the hemispherical display.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="08802cc496484a38aa201dc5a03ca95b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Spot-2024-release-Smart-alarm-clock-with-vibrant-sound-Alexa-Black/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>What screen you do have is more than enough to display the time and weather information, plus it can show you the song or album title and accompanying artwork when you’re listening to music on those improved speakers. It can naturally be used to boss around your other connected smart devices, too.</p> 
<p>Alexa might be baked in, but the Echo Spot is intended to be a fairly bare-bones smart alarm clock, so don’t expect as many features as you’ll find on something like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-2023-echo-show-is-faster-and-offers-improved-audio-140027400.html"><ins>Echo Show 5</ins></a>. But a lot of people just want a modern alarm clock, and arguably the biggest selling point for the Echo Spot is its total lack of a camera. While that means it can do less than the original 2017 Echo Spot, which Amazon did put a camera in, the decision to remove it from a device that lives right next to your bed was probably for the best.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">If you’re looking to a new set of Beats earbuds but aren’t a fan of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">the company’s over-the-ear hook</a>, there’s another fresh option to consider. The Apple-owned company revealed its latest model, the Powerbeats Fit, which looks a lot like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">the Beats Fit Pro</a> that debuted in 2021. That’s because this new set of earbuds is the direct successor to that four-year-old audio accessory.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Don’t expect a comprehensive overhaul though. In addition to the name change, Beats says it made the Powerbeats Fit more comfortable with a 20 percent more flexible wingtip. The whole package is also more compact thanks to a 17 percent smaller case. The price is staying the same as the previous model though, as the company kept that at $200.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Beats says that the updated wingtip makes the Powerbeats Fit sit as securely in your ears as the Powerbeats Pro’s hook design. The added flex means the earbuds are comfortable enough to be worn all day, according to the company, not just during workouts. The Powerbeats Fit still has an IPX4 rating for water resistance, so sweaty activities shouldn’t be a problem. And to further improve fit, Beats added an extra small ear tip to the three previous sizes (small, medium and large).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In addition to slightly slimming down the charging case, Beats also added IPX4 moisture protection there. It’s not the most robust coverage, but it’s certainly better than nothing, and it’s enough to withstand water splashes near the pool or in the locker room. There are also new colors for the Powerbeats Fit: orange and pink.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Alongside these modest upgrades, the Powerbeats Fit retains much of what made the Beats Fit Pro a popular choice for ANC (active noise canceling) earbuds. Apple’s H1 chip powers the features once again, including Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Adaptive EQ, Audio Sharing, hands-free Siri and automatic switching between devices. You’ll also get transparency mode, Find My and FaceTime with Dolby Atmos spatial audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Powerbeats Fit settings are baked into iOS, but Android users will use a dedicated app for customization like other recent Beats devices. Here, you can expect one-touch pairing, customizable controls, battery status, Locate My Beats and an ear tip fit test. All of that is available to iPhone users too, so neither group of OS loyalists will miss out.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Onboard controls offer quick access to playback changes, volume adjustments, listening modes, calls and voice assistants. These are still physical buttons, which can be an important consideration over the tappable, touch-based panels that some of the competition employs. Battery life is also consistent with the Beats Fit Pro: up to seven hours on the earbuds and up to 30 hours total with the charging case with ANC off. Turn noise cancellation on and you can expect six hours of use (24 hours with the case).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Powerbeats Fit is available for preorder today in black, gray, orange and pink color options for $200. The earbuds will hit retail shelves on October 2.</p>

A mainstay of Prime Day sales, a pair of Blink Mini 2 cameras is on sale for only $35. That's 50 percent off, a record low and less than what you'd usually pay for one. It's also Engadget's pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-security-camera-130035012.html">the best budget security camera</a>.</p>

The camera is well-suited for nighttime video: It has a built-in LED spotlight, color night vision and a low-light sensor. Day or night, it records in sharp 1080p resolution. It also has a wider field of view than its predecessor.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

It is relatively pricey however, and the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-se-3-vs-apple-watch-series-11-how-do-they-compare-120140064.html">Watch SE 3</a> is probably enough for most users, but the Series 11 has a brighter and larger display, a thinner design, longer battery life and more advanced health features.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your laptop simply isn’t cutting it anymore, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">October Prime Day</a> might have arrived just in time. As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant for Amazon's Big Deal Days, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t know how to figure out if that laptop you’re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale.<br><br>That’s where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you’re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, October Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-prime-day-laptop-deals-macbooks">Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks</h2> 
<p> <core-commerce id="b32d0e63c9964a9fb578acc5db00f20e" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDCPMGK/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-prime-day-laptop-deals-windows-laptops">Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops</h2> 
<p>You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-prime-day-laptop-deals-chromebooks">Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks</h2> 
<p>Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the Dash Forward keynote, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/doordash-is-buying-british-rival-deliveroo-for-39-billion-123005055.html">DoorDash</a> has unveiled a cute electric delivery robot named Dot that was designed specifically for quick neighborhood trips. Dot is around one-tenth the size of a car, can move up to 20 mph and can navigate not just roads, but also bike lanes and sidewalks. It&#39;s small enough to fit through doorways and driveways and can help local businesses meet demand from people who prefer to shop from the comfort of their own homes. The robot was developed in-house by DoorDash Labs to integrate with the company&#39;s new Autonomous Delivery Platform, an AI dispatcher that matches orders with the best delivery method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You don’t always need a full-sized car to deliver a tube of toothpaste or pack of diapers,&quot; said Stanley Tang, the head of DoorDash Labs. &quot;That’s the insight behind Dot.&quot; To start with, the company is launching an early access program for Dot in Tempe and Mesa, Arizona. DoorDash said it&#39;s the beginning of Dot&#39;s commercial deployment and that the robot will make its way to new markets in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has assured Dashers the Dot will not replace them. Human dashers will still handle the &quot;vast majority&quot; of its deliveries, and Dot is supposed to allow them to pick up the more high value ones while it fills in the gaps for local trips that don&#39;t pay as much. DoorDash said that it needed to conjure up more &quot;innovative ways to keep pace with demand&quot; to support more local businesses and as it expands to new regions. It also previously teamed up with Coco Robotics to offer sidewalk <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/doordash-starts-robot-deliveries-in-la-and-chicago-172358704.html">robot deliveries in LA and Chicago</a>, and it offers drone deliveries in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-is-testing-a-drone-delivery-feature-in-virginia-163015059.html">Christiansburg, Virginia</a> and Frisco, Texas.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/doordash-introduces-a-cute-delivery-robot-named-dot-130036016.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since it began rolling out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html"><ins>AI Mode at the start of March</ins></a>, Google has been slowly adding features to its dedicated search chatbot. Today, the company is releasing an update it hopes will make the tool more useful for visual searches.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve tried to use AI Mode since Google made it available to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-rolling-out-ai-mode-to-everyone-in-the-us-174917628.html"><ins>everyone in the US</ins></a>, you may have noticed it responds to questions about images with a lot of text. Robby Stein, vice president of product for Google Search, admits it can be &quot;silly&quot; to see text in that context, and so the company has been working on applying AI Mode&#39;s &quot;query fan-out&quot; technique to images. Now, when you prompt AI Mode to find you images of &quot;moody but maximalist&quot; bedrooms for instance, it&#39;s better equipped to respond to that request, with an algorithm that will run multiple searches in the background to get a better understanding of exactly what it is you&#39;re looking to find.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google has built this feature to be multimodal, meaning you can start a conversation with an image or video. And as you can probably guess, Google believes these capabilities will be particularly useful in a shopping context. You could use AI Mode to shop before today, but Google argues the experience benefits greatly from the more visual responses the chatbot is able to generate. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s better able to make sense of tricky queries like &quot;find me barrel jeans that aren&#39;t too baggy.&quot; Once AI Mode generates an initial response, you can ask follow-up questions to refine your search.</p>
<p>As with any Google update, it may take a few days for the company to roll out the updates it announced today to everyone. So be patient if you don&#39;t see the new, more visual experience right away.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-mode-gets-better-at-understanding-visual-prompts-130001201.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Shark offers several variations of its AI Ultra robot vacuums.

<p>The model that's on sale here is said to run for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough to clean an entire floor in a typical home. The self-emptying, bagless vacuum can store up to 30 days worth of dirt and debris in its base. Shark says it can capture 99.97 percent of dust and allergens with the help of HEPA filtration.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Would you pay $20 for an AI-powered browser? Opera is betting on it with the release of its $19.90 (per month) &quot;next generation AI browser,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://press.opera.com/2025/09/30/opera-neon-ai-agentic-browser-release/">Opera Neon</a>, meant for people who use AI every day. The Norwegian company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/operas-new-fully-agentic-browser-can-surf-the-web-for-you-145035874.html">first announced Neon</a> in May and has now launched it to a limited number of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Opera, &quot;it&#39;s a browser built to not only let you browse the web, but to also use agentic AI to act for you and with you as you browse and work on complex projects. Opera Neon moves beyond a simple AI chat to execute tasks, create code, and deliver outcomes directly within the browser experience.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="561854e22ae543ec80b801071384cfdc"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKQ98413RCI?si=FIHU8sOhrdglFLCE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Opera Neon includes features such as Tasks, which acts as your own workspaces to use AI for things like comparing and analyzing sources. There&#39;s also Cards, which is made up of reusable AI prompts, versus having to rewrite the same prompt over and over again. You can make your own prompts or pull them from the community&#39;s collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s Neon Do, which works with a Task to navigate the web for checking sources, looking at information, completing forms and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opera is hoping that this &quot;premium, subscription-based browser&quot; will entice users enough to pay $19.90 per month, rather than use free options such as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-in-chrome-no-longer-requires-a-subscription-170045611.html">Google&#39;s Gemini-powered Chrome features</a>. You can join the waitlist to try it yourself, with Opera claiming more spots will become available soon.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/operas-ai-browser-will-cost-you-20-a-month-123022110.html?src=rss]]></description>

The glasses only support a prescription range of -4.00 to +4.00, though, so they won't be compatible with all prescriptions.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The company recently said it's seen "strong" demand for demos and it looks like most locations are already booked out for several weeks, judging by Meta's scheduling website. It will also be difficult if you don't live near a major city. For example, Sunglass Hut's website currently lists just </span><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9464c97b-856e-4375-998b-ec6bdcced107&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=64e91778-8f65-430a-97ec-131bc0ae47b2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sunglass+Hut&amp;linkText=seven+locations&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2h1dC5jb20vdXMvc3VuZ2xhc3Nlcy9tZXRhLXJheS1iYW4tZGlzcGxheSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjRlOTE3NzgtOGY2NS00MzBhLTk3ZWMtMTMxYmMwYWU0N2IyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2h1dC5jb20vdXMvc3VuZ2xhc3Nlcy9tZXRhLXJheS1iYW4tZGlzcGxheSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATRgg709ZHSS008N6PiIjWqoCurfjKnHx01dDhXvMFNU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunglasshut.com%2Fus%2Fsunglasses%2Fmeta-ray-ban-display" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sunglass Hut;elmt:" data-original-link="https://www.sunglasshut.com/us/sunglasses/meta-ray-ban-display"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">seven locations</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> where demos will be available.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The good news is that Meta does plan to eventually increase availability. The company has said the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses will be available in Canada, France, Italy and the UK beginning in "early 2026" and that it expects buying options will "expand" the longer they're on sale.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Sales of the glasses, which are Meta's first to incorporate a heads-up display, will be closely watched. At $799, the glasses are significantly more expensive than the rest of the frames in Meta's expanding lineup of "AI glasses." But, as </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html">I wrote</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> after my recent demo at Meta Connect, the display also enables wearers to do much more than what's currently possible with the existing Ray-Ban or Oakley models. </span></p>

The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://nothing.community/d/43102-cmf-headphone-pro-remix-everything">Headphone Pro</a> offers remarkable specs for less than $100, with features like 40dB of noise cancellation, LDAC (Lossless Digital Audio Codec) and Hi-Res certification for both wired and wireless audio, along with an "Energy Slider" to adjust EQ.</p> 
<p>The CMF Headphone Pro doesn't at all resemble Nothing's boxy over-the-ear <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-over-ear-headphones-price-release-date-173018845.html">Headphone 1 cans</a>. While that design was rather eccentric and austere, CMF's model has a softer, more conventional look with a rounded headband reminiscent of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478-160045458.html">Sony's WH-1000XM5s</a>. Another prominent feature is the large, interchangeable ear cups that appear to have generous padding.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>CMF's new cans come with adaptive ANC that reduces outside sounds by 40dB or up to 99 percent and automatically adjust the level according to outside noise. Though battery life is a generous 100 hours with ANC disabled, it gets cut in half to 50 hours with ANC turned on. That's still more than <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html">Sony's new WH-1000XM6</a>, even without ANC enabled. You can get an additional four hours of service with just a five minute charge, and the Headphone Pro can be directly charged by some smartphones via a USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Control-wise, the Headphone Pro is nicely analog, with buttons instead of the touch controls found on other headphones. Those include Bluetooth/power button on one side and an action button on the other that's customizable via Nothing's X app. There's a multifunction rocker for volume, playback and control of ANC/ambient sound. Then there's the Energy Slider that lets you make treble and bass adjustments without the need to dive into the X app's EQ settings.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The fall tech events just won’t stop. Today, Amazon has its fall hardware event, which is likely to reveal improvements to voice assistant Alexa and some new Echo homes for it to live inside. It’s been a couple years since the Echo Show got an update, and it’s been even longer for the standard Echo.</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-from-amazons-event-on-tuesday-september-30-210035284.html">invitation</a> suggests we’re expecting some Kindle upgrades too — the image on the invitation is a Kindle with a color illustration. The Kindle Scribe 2 came out earlier this year as did the Kindle Colorsoft, so maybe there’s something in the works that combines the best features of both.</p>
<p>While Alexa and Kindle will be the main draws, Amazon&#39;s other tech brands, such as Ring and Eero, may also be present. In short, it&#39;s likely to be a busy event.</p>
<p>It all kicks off at 10AM ET in New York City, where we’ll be reporting live. Stay tuned for all the announcements on our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-event-2025-live-updates-from-the-devices-and-services-launch-today-100017137.html">Amazon devices liveblog</a>. There’s no video livestream, so we’ll be updating from the event like it’s 2010.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts has agreed to a $55 billion acquisition that will take the company private. Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake and Affinity Partners have reached a deal to buy EA and its collection of sports game franchises and, er, other games that have recently struggled. This year, the company canceled an upcoming <em>Black Panther</em> game and closed the studio behind it, and has reportedly “shelved” its <em>Need For Speed </em>Franchise. Then there was <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/anthem-is-officially-shutting-down-on-january-12-185236926.html"><em>Anthem</em></a>. The deal, the largest-ever leveraged buyout, marks the end of EA’s 35-year run as a publicly traded company.&#92;</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-whoops">Whoops.</h3>
<h3 id="jump-link-"></h3>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently published a 163-page pdf showing the electrical schematics for the iPhone 16e, despite Apple specifically requesting they be confidential. This was most likely a mistake on the part of the FCC, according to a report by <em>AppleInsider</em>.</p>
<p>The files included block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, antenna locations and more. Competitors could simply buy a handset and open it up to access this information, as the iPhone 16e was released back in February, but this leak would eliminate any guesswork. The FCC hasn’t addressed how this leak happened.</p>

<p>Sony has been marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation by selling stuff. Things like PS5 consoles and accessories styled after the PS1. (I just got the controller. Brag.) The company is also publishing a photography book showcasing “never-before-seen prototypes, concept sketches and design models that shaped hardware development” from the early days through to the current PS5 era. Sony has also teamed up with Reebok for a collection of 30th anniversary sneakers styled after the PS1.</p>

OpenAI has launched a new feature called <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/">Instant Checkout</a>, which is powered by Agentic Commerce Protocol, a technology it developed with Stripe. When you search for items to buy through ChatGPT, you&#39;ll be able to see which ones you can buy from within the chatbot among the products it shows you. The feature is available for both free and paid users, but it only supports single-item purchases from Etsy sellers in the US at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenAI says over a million sellers that use Shopify, including Glossier, SKIMS and Spanx, will support the Instant Checkout &quot;soon.&quot; It&#39;s also adding multi-item cart checkout and is expanding the feature&#39;s reach to more regions in the future. The company is open sourcing Agentic Commerce Protocol to allow more merchants to work on their ChatGPT integrations.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its post, OpenAI said that it will continue ranking the product results most relevant to your search query based on availability, price and quality. It will not give products that support Instant Checkout a boost and will not rank them higher than other options just because of the feature. Your orders and payments will still be handled by the merchant you&#39;re buying from, and you can either use your card on file with OpenAI or other available payment options. The company also said that it&#39;s the merchants who&#39;ll be paying a &quot;small fee on completed purchases,&quot; and that Instant Checkout will not affect product prices for you.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-you-buy-things-from-etsy-within-chatgpt-110032055.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve shopped around for a wireless mouse at any point in the past decade, you’ve probably seen lots of people recommending a Logitech MX Master. There’s good reason for that: They aren’t cheap, but they’re usually comfortable, versatile and loaded with features designed to make working in front of a monitor all day a little less annoying. The current MX Master 3S has sat at the top of our own <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-mice-pc-gaming-mobile-150027822.html">wireless mouse buying guide</a> for some time now.</p> 
<p>Now, three years after releasing the 3S, Logitech is rolling out the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Logitech;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fdaa2a65-d62a-4550-a218-582b09bd6665&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;linkText=MX+Master+4&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpdGVjaC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9wL214LW1hc3Rlci00LjkxMC0wMDc1NjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZkYWEyYTY1LWQ2MmEtNDU1MC1hMjE4LTU4MmIwOWJkNjY2NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG9naXRlY2guY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvcC9teC1tYXN0ZXItNC45MTAtMDA3NTYwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ6FHfGNYMCW6eYWyIJVax-c5i71sxCA-fAicJ_N1hg_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fmx-master-4.910-007560" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-4.910-007560">MX Master 4</a>, which costs $120 and will ship in October. I’ve been able to test it out for the past few weeks.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>For the most part, this is an iterative update, with the same general shape, battery life, 8K DPI sensor and ultra-quiet clicks as the MX Master 3S before it. It is a touch heavier (150 grams vs. 141g), wider (3.48 inches vs 3.32 in.) and taller (5.05 inches vs. 4.92 in.) than the last model, but if you found the 3S or older MX Master 3 comfortable, you should have few issues here. That said, it’s still a hefty mouse designed for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://switchandclick.com/mouse-grips/">palm grippers</a> and right-handed users: Its gentle contours, generous hump, ample thumb rest and large buttons will fit like a glove if that describes you, but lefties and those with especially petite hands won’t agree.</p>

<p>The flashiest change here is the addition of haptic feedback, which is built into a small panel within the mouse’s thumb rest. You can customize the intensity of this effect through Logitech’s Options+ software — or turn it off entirely — but it essentially brings a modicum of smartphone-style feedback to your desktop. When you first pair the mouse, for one, you’ll feel a little bump. The same goes if you move between devices using <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Logitech;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fdaa2a65-d62a-4550-a218-582b09bd6665&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;linkText=Logitech%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%9CFlow%E2%80%9D+feature&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpdGVjaC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc29mdHdhcmUvZmVhdHVyZXMvZmxvdy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZGFhMmE2NS1kNjJhLTQ1NTAtYTIxOC01ODJiMDliZDY2NjUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvZ2l0ZWNoLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zb2Z0d2FyZS9mZWF0dXJlcy9mbG93Lmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVsF71uWnfUYf6ov7-3ctQq5e7NALhTg83AsbtTW655W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware%2Ffeatures%2Fflow.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/features/flow.html">Logitech’s “Flow” feature</a>. When battery is low, it’ll vibrate. If you’re trying to precisely line up a graphic in an app like Photoshop, you’ll get a little buzz when you’ve moved it to the exact right spot.</p> 
<p>You’ll also feel it when you hover over options in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Logitech;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fdaa2a65-d62a-4550-a218-582b09bd6665&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;linkText=Actions+Ring&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpdGVjaC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc29mdHdhcmUvbG9naS1vcHRpb25zLXBsdXMvYWN0aW9ucy1yaW5nLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZkYWEyYTY1LWQ2MmEtNDU1MC1hMjE4LTU4MmIwOWJkNjY2NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG9naXRlY2guY29tL2VuLXVzL3NvZnR3YXJlL2xvZ2ktb3B0aW9ucy1wbHVzL2FjdGlvbnMtcmluZy5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXKMo-ww3r6Z-Ro0-Rqgxbb3zvb-NtYpnKwOp7OAfRjT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware%2Flogi-options-plus%2Factions-ring.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus/actions-ring.html">Actions Ring</a>, a customizable overlay that presents different shortcuts depending on the app you’re using. This pops up when you click the side panel; you could use it quickly access the screenshot tool while in Chrome, for instance, or the brightness and contrast sliders in Photoshop.</p> 
<p>If all of this sounds like a gimmick, well, yeah it kind of is. It’s not the kind of thing anyone <em>needs</em>. But the effect is surprisingly subtle on the default “medium” setting, and there’s a level of reassurance that comes with feeling a confirmed action instead of just seeing it. I found it more pleasant than distracting. The catch is that only a few apps will natively support the MX Master 4’s haptics at launch: Photoshop, Lightroom and Zoom, with Adobe Premiere Pro to follow soon after. You’ll still be able to utilize the haptic feedback on a system level on Windows and macOS, and Logitech is releasing an SDK for more developers to integrate the functionality, but we’ll have to see how many do so.</p>

<p>Another change is with the mouse’s coating, which trades the 3S’ rubbery finish for a lightly textured plastic around the top. (The thumb rest and right side still use rubber.) Some users have complained about older MX Master mice <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/17qntg3/logitech_mx_master_3s_rubber_falling_apart/">peeling</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1crsb9c/mx_master_3_rubber_wear_after_3_years_of_nearly/">wearing down</a> after extended use; time will tell how well the new model holds up, but it should avoid the same sort of sweat-induced degradation. Either way, I’ve found it smooth to the touch without being slippery. I also haven’t been able to replicate the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/wpp1c6/logitech_mx_master_3s_scrollwheel_is_still/">accuracy issues</a> some 3S buyers <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1nh9c0k/logitech_mx_master_3s_scroll_wheel_issue/">have had</a> with that mouse’s electromagnetic scroll wheel, which is still made of a high-quality metal and lets you conveniently swap between a notched and free-spin scroll on the fly.</p> 
<p>There are other minor tweaks and improvements. The receiver included with the Windows model is now USB-C instead of USB-A. The horizontal scroll wheel on the side — which remains a blessing for navigating spreadsheets — extends a little farther with each spin. The PTFE feet on the bottom are a bit larger for a smoother glide. The dedicated gesture button is no longer awkwardly integrated into the thumb rest; instead, it’s been pulled out ahead of the two programmable side buttons. Logitech says there’s a more powerful chip inside the mouse to improve connection quality. The edges around the main click buttons are now translucent: nothing major, but a bit more stylish. The screws on the bottom are now exposed, too, which Logitech says should be helpful for recycling purposes down the road.</p>

<p>The rest is largely the same as before, which isn’t a bad thing. The best feature here is still the virtually silent main buttons, which keep a pleasing level of travel but will never bother anyone around you. Battery life is still rated at a solid 70 days, which seems about right — I haven’t charged the mouse in about a month and the Options+ app says I still have about 50 percent juice left. The design still feels super sturdy, with no flexing or creaking. The side buttons feel firm and tactile. Options+ is resource-heavy but still intuitive enough for reprogramming buttons and customizing app-specific settings. It can still track on a variety of surfaces, including glass or the fabric of my couch. You can still connect to three devices simultaneously and switch between them with a button on the bottom, too.</p> 
<p>On the downside, there’s no USB-C cable included in the box anymore, and the polling rate is still set at a basic 125Hz, which means tracking isn’t quite as buttery smooth as it could be. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Logitech;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fdaa2a65-d62a-4550-a218-582b09bd6665&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;linkText=Mac+version&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpdGVjaC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9wL214LW1hc3Rlci00LW1hYy45MTAtMDA3NTc1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZGFhMmE2NS1kNjJhLTQ1NTAtYTIxOC01ODJiMDliZDY2NjUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvZ2l0ZWNoLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zaG9wL3AvbXgtbWFzdGVyLTQtbWFjLjkxMC0wMDc1NzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfH2rOsLmODknU1ZufUtTM_XIoMiM8qkQE1JYZP2Ufir&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fmx-master-4-mac.910-007575" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-4-mac.910-007575">Mac version</a> doesn’t come with a USB receiver, and there’s still no built-in storage compartment for the dongle with either model. You also need to keep Options+ open to feel the haptic feedback, which is annoying. Some of those complaints have been issues for a while, so it’s frustrating to see them three years later. Still, they’re probably not dealbreakers. The MX Master 4 may not be a essential upgrade if you’re happy with an older MX Master mouse, and if those didn’t work for you before, this one probably won’t work for you now. But if you’re a power user in the market for a new productivity mouse, we’d expect this newest iteration to be as popular as its predecessors.</p>

It tracks metrics like body fat, muscle mass and water percentage, then syncs that data to your phone so you can see changes over time. If you want to take control of your health, the best smart scale gives you clear insights and helps you stay consistent with your goals.<br><br>Some models focus on accuracy, while others support multiple user profiles or connect with apps you already use. With so many options available, choosing the best smart scale comes down to the features that matter most for your routine. This guide highlights our top picks to make that decision easier.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-smart-scale-safety"><strong>Smart scale safety</strong></h2> 
<p>There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.”</p> 
<p>A meta-analysis from <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742706/">2016</a> found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.138.suppl_1.10962">2018 study</a>, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smart-scale">What to look for in a smart scale</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-weight">Weight</h3> 
<p>A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you're after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity">Connectivity</h3> 
<p>Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bone-density">Bone density</h3> 
<p>The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-body-fat-percentage-and-muscle-mass">Body fat percentage and muscle mass</h3> 
<p>Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bmi">BMI</h3> 
<p>A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/">overly simplistic</a> and often <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/august/obesitymortality-paradox-demon">greatly misleading</a>. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pulse-wave-velocity">Pulse Wave Velocity</h3> 
<p>French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wearables-and-integration">Wearables and integration</h3> 
<p>Pairing your smart scale with wearables like <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html">fitness trackers</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">smartwatches</a> can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-display">Display</h3> 
<p>Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-app-and-subscriptions">App and subscriptions</h3> 
<p>You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-data-portability">Data portability</h3> 
<p>Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.</p> 
<p>All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.)</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-power">Power</h3> 
<p>It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-and-which-smart-scales-we-tested">How we tested and which smart scales we tested</h2> 
<p>For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mi-xiaomi-body-composition-scale-2">Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2</h3> 
<p>Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four.</p>

<p>Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway.</p>

<p>Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health.</p> 
<p>It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat.</p>

<p>Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady.</p> 
<p>Joking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress.</p>

<p>Garmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies.</p>

<p>At the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look.</p>

<p>If you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a <em>super</em>car, or a <em>hyper</em>car if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a <em>super</em>-smart scale, or a <em>hyper</em>-smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-smart-scales-faqs">Smart scales FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-smart-scale-and-a-regular-scale">What's the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale?</h3> 
<p>A regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model.</p> 
<p>What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-smart-scales-work-with-more-than-one-person-using-it">How do smart scales work with more than one person using it?</h3> 
<p>When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it.</p> 
<p>Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a development that should <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-apparently-making-a-social-network-175842370.html">surprise no one</a>, OpenAI is preparing to release a standalone social app powered by its upcoming Sora 2 video model, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-sora-2-tiktok-like-app/"><em>Wired </em>reports</a>. The app reportedly &quot;closely resembles&quot; TikTok, with a vertical video feed and swipe-to-scroll navigation. The catch? It will only feature AI-generated content; there&#39;s apparently no option for the user to upload photos or videos from their phone&#39;s camera roll.</p>
<p><em>Wired</em> adds OpenAI will limit Sora 2 to generating clips that are 10 seconds long or shorter for use inside of the app. It&#39;s unclear what the model&#39;s limit will be outside of the app. TikTok, following an original limit of 15 seconds, allows people to upload clips that are up to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-time-limit-10-minutes-174130936.html?src=rss"><ins>10 minutes long</ins></a>. The new app is also said to include an identity verification tool. Should a user take advantage of the feature, Sora 2 will be able to use their likeness in videos it generates. In turn, that means other people will be able to tag those users and use their likeness when they go to remix one of their videos. As a safety precaution, OpenAI will push a notification to users whenever their likeness is used by someone else, even in situations where someone makes a video but never posts it to the app&#39;s feed.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <em>Wired</em>, the software will refuse to generate some videos due to copyright restrictions. However, it&#39;s not clear just how robust these protections will be, with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Wall Street Journal;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1697a75e-85d8-4ed5-b1d5-6f39e297a5fc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;linkText=The+Wall+Street+Journal+reporting&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvYWkvb3BlbmFpcy1uZXctc29yYS12aWRlby1nZW5lcmF0b3ItdG8tcmVxdWlyZS1jb3B5cmlnaHQtaG9sZGVycy10by1vcHQtb3V0LTA3MWQ4YjJhP21vZD1lMnR3ZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTY5N2E3NWUtODVkOC00ZWQ1LWIxZDUtNmYzOWUyOTdhNWZjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvYWkvb3BlbmFpcy1uZXctc29yYS12aWRlby1nZW5lcmF0b3ItdG8tcmVxdWlyZS1jb3B5cmlnaHQtaG9sZGVycy10by1vcHQtb3V0LTA3MWQ4YjJhP21vZD1lMnR3ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX3gNOHuHC25c96871xQUYVmgYoAdakaIt3tn1wBSAxt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fai%2Fopenais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a%3Fmod%3De2twd" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a?mod=e2twd"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal </ins></em><ins>reporting</ins></a> OpenAI will require rights holders to opt out of their content appearing in videos Sora 2 generates.</p>
<p>As for why OpenAI would release a social media app, <em>Wired</em> suggests the company saw an opportunity after President Trump repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to bring <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trump-signs-executive-order-saying-his-tiktok-deal-is-legal-204607521.html"><ins>TikTok&#39;s US business under American control</ins></a>. By adding a social component to Sora, OpenAI may also be hoping to dissuade people from trying other models since leaving its new app would mean abandoning whatever community forms around it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-reportedly-release-a-tiktok-like-social-app-alongside-sora-2-205842527.html?src=rss]]></description>
