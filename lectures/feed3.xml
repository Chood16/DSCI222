                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s the first week of a new year and there&#39;s no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That&#39;s because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they&#39;re planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we&#39;re keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung has already held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs. Presentations from NVIDIA, Sony, Lego, Hyundai and others are yet to come.</p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos that are being shown off at the event) right here. We&#39;ll be keeping this story updated throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="58d7743a-3001-4b75-a49d-5560b8baa777">Micro RGB TVs&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" style="height:1423px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&amp;#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV." data-uuid="0e796659-fedf-4a07-9718-5aab3d0b16da"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you&#39;re shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that&#39;s similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren&#39;t quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can&#39;t be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#39;re seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">unveiled</a> its first Micro RGB TV in August, — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.</p><p>LG revealed its first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Micro RGB set</a> at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">showed off its latest Wallpaper TV</a>, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">new Gallery TV</a> — The Gallery is the company&#39;s take on Samsung&#39;s Frame TV format.</p><h2 id="3ac1d579-4b48-481d-bc1f-94fa0a6e1605">Samsung</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/69776940-e9f8-11f0-afca-02ae016f217d" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/69776940-e9f8-11f0-afca-02ae016f217d" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026." data-uuid="0dab8a2c-1810-31fd-a73f-1279914d4cd3"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve than just TVs.

It also announced plans to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">bring Google Photos to TVs</a>.</p><p>At the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-the-biggest-announcements-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059466.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">First Look showcase</a> on Sunday, Samsung talked up &quot;AI experiences everywhere. For everyone&quot; (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPdEMp1fOA4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>First Look has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company&#39;s fridges, such as ​​recipe selection, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that&#39;s said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.</p><p>Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you&#39;re not home.</p><h2 id="ea0b6a54-f846-4c76-a256-3ee71929ee2c">LG</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="LG&#39;s CLOiD robot." data-uuid="4f24430f-4e32-4bc7-a1ad-481a02508ce9"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s CLOiD robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>Likewise, LG brought more than TVs to CES. The company is shining the spotlight on its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-reveals-its-laundry-folding-robot-at-ces-2026-215121021.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">CLOiD robot.</a> Like the far creepier-looking <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/1x-neo-is-a-20000-home-robot-that-will-learn-chores-via-teleoperation-040252200.html" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">1X Neo</a>, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you&#39;ll be able to buy anytime soon, but we should get a closer look at the CLOiD in person later this week.</p><p>The company also debuted the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">LG Sound Suite</a>, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos.

The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.</p><p>The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we&#39;ve seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it&#39;s only in prototype form for now and it isn&#39;t expected to hit the market until next year.&nbsp;</p><p>The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair, just like L&#39;Oreal&#39;s AirLight Pro. It&#39;s said to have sensors that employ &quot;built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning&quot; so they can adapt to your gestures and &quot;maximize individual experience.&quot; L&#39;Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation &quot;effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.&quot; You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.</p><h2 id="3a0c40ec-e388-4012-b43a-4bb96e371262">Laptops and desktops</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/ba75d440-e9fc-11f0-afde-c89b2340c992" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/ba75d440-e9fc-11f0-afde-c89b2340c992" style="height:1053px;width:2000px;" alt="LG Gram Pro" data-uuid="bc407a01-c214-3d6c-8bf1-ecb0dd2b591e"/><figcaption>LG Gram Pro</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>It&#39;s CES season, so of course we&#39;re going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops.

Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical keyboard for phones. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.clicksphone.com/communicator" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">reserve one now</a> for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.</p><p>As for the new keyboard, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150 mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring.

It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone&#39;s playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There&#39;s a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of this for free then it&#39;s a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The web model won&#39;t be much different from the existing Alexa+ that&#39;s already available on Echo devices, Fire TV and Fire tablets. However, instead of buying into the Amazon ecosystem, Early Access customers can use any web browser to get Alexa+&#39;s help with everything from basic questions to complex tasks, like controlling your smart home devices, customizing a recipe to account for dietary restrictions or making restaurant reservations if you don&#39;t feel like cooking. The Alexa+ web version will also feature a navigation sidebar that will be home to your most-used Alexa features.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bee, the company behind an always-listening AI wearable that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-acquiring-an-ai-wearable-that-listens-to-everything-you-do-221103233.html"><ins>Amazon acquired last year</ins></a>, has announced new features in a status update. The device is designed to run in the background of daily life and captures conversations or thoughts spoken aloud. Recording can be started or stopped with the push of a button.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Bee, Maria de Lourdes Zollo, says the company has shipped four major updates that will run on the existing Bee Pioneer hardware. The first is “Actions,” which connects Bee to a user&#39;s email and calendar and works to turn spoken commitments into actions. The company says that when you say you need to send an e-mail, for instance, Bee can draft one for you.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Daily Insights” is designed to identify patterns and trends based on information collected over weeks or months. The company says the goal of this feature is to notice things before a user might, including &quot;shifts in your relationships&quot; and recommend personalized goals related to these, like a life coach of sorts.</p>
<p>“Voice Notes” lets a user press the record button on Bee and log a fleeting thought, a task for a to-do list or anything else that a user wants to recall later. Finally, &quot;Templates&quot; is designed to organize and summarize large amounts of information into a more digestible format. It can also create a study plan from a lecture or recap a sales meeting with a client.</p>
<p>Most of these features would presumably be more useful if a user sets their Bee to record constantly, which raises questions around legality and privacy. Zollo says that Bee processes audio in real time so no audio is ever stored, adding that neither Bee nor Amazon ever have access to transcripts. Still, the wearable could come up against recording consent laws which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.justia.com/50-state-surveys/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations/"><ins>vary by jurisdiction</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/bee-has-been-busy-since-its-acquisition-by-amazon-last-year-150025311.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon just revealed the Ember Artline TV at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html">CES 2026</a>. This is a lifestyle TV that displays art, putting it in direct competition with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">Samsung&#39;s The Frame</a>. The 4K QLED screen is extremely thin, at 1.5-inches, so it&#39;ll likely fit just about anywhere.</p>
<p>It also features a glare-reducing matte screen that has been &quot;designed to make your art and photos look great.&quot; The Artline integrates with Amazon Photos and offers access to 2,000 pieces of free art to display. For those worried about electricity usage, the TV includes proprietary technology that senses when someone has entered or left the room and turns on or off accordingly.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The display comes with Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">new smart assistant Alexa+</a>, allowing it to double as a smart TV. This is helped along by the inclusion of far-field microphones. Alexa+ is a beefier version of the company&#39;s long-standing digital assistant. You can talk to it like a person, if that&#39;s your bag. There&#39;s even a new use case in which Alexa+ analyzes the aesthetics of a room and recommends art to throw on the screen.</p>

<p>This is also a standard TV. It features support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6 and will operate on the Fire TV platform. Customers can choose from 10 magnetic frames in a wide variety of colorways, further diversifying the aesthetics.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have a release date yet, other than &quot;later this spring.&quot; Amazon has released pricing, however, as this TV starts at $899 for the 55-inch version.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ember-artline-is-amazons-answer-to-samsungs-the-frame-150015104.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is kicking off the new year by announcing a redesign of its Fire TV UI at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>. The new UI is designed to make finding things to watch on the platform faster, while making it easier to access more of Fire TV&#39;s features straight from the home screen.</p><p>On first blush, the biggest difference in the new Fire TV UI is that everything is rounder. Shows, movies and apps have rounded corners, and Amazon&#39;s changed the spacing in the interface to give everything more room to breathe. Tweaks to typography and color gradients also give the UI a more modern feel, and Amazon says it&#39;s rebuilt the code of the Fire TV software to make everything faster, too, in some cases demonstrating &quot;up to 20-30 percent gains in speed.&quot;</p><p>The fundamentals haven&#39;t changed all that much, however. There&#39;s a menu bar of different tabs at the top of the interface that separates the Home page from things like Movies, TV Shows and Sports. Each page shows content in carousels, and Amazon still lets you pin streaming apps like Netflix or Apple TV underneath recommended content, with the biggest difference being you can now pin more apps at once (20 rather than six). Amazon is also changing up how the Fire TV Remote works. Pressing the Menu button now lets you quickly access Fire TV&#39;s Art &amp; Photos, Games and Ambient Experience features, and a long press of the Home button pulls up a shortcut panel with access to things like settings and connected Ring cameras. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Alexa+</a>, Amazon&#39;s rebuilt AI assistant, is also available directly inside of the Fire TV interface for adding things to your watchlist, recommending content and controlling your smart home.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Fire-TV-mobile-app.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Fire-TV-mobile-app.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The redesigned Fire TV mobile app with access to content and browsing watchlists." data-uuid="5afe480c-fe8a-42f4-bd35-96401e6a6de8"/><figcaption>The new Fire TV mobile app can act as a remote and a way to search Amazon&#39;s library of content.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon offers the Fire TV mobile app as a way to control its streaming devices and TVs with a smartphone, but alongside this redesign, the company is also expanding what the app can do. The new Fire TV app lets you browse content, edit your watchlist and start playing things on your TV, in much the same way Roku and Google&#39;s streaming apps do.</p><p>Both the new Fire TV mobile app and redesigned Fire TV UI will be available for free for all users, Amazon says. The new Fire TV UI will launch in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, the second-generation Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED series. Later in the spring, Amazon says it will bring the redesign to more countries and devices, including the latest Fire TV 4K streaming devices, TVs like the Fire TV 2-series, 4-series and Fire TV Omni QLED series and TVs from third-party partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic and TCL.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/amazon-is-redesigning-its-fire-tv-ui-for-streaming-sticks-and-tvs-150000622.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html">best ereaders</a>, and for good reason. It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="feed13a4ff304bf1a5611d4015f6cd38" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-big-january-conference-120000956.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is still a day away from officially opening, but Sunday, January 4, delivered the first real wave of news. As has become tradition, the pre-show slate set the tone for the week ahead, anchored by Samsung’s annual First Look press conference and CES Unveiled, the latter of which where hundreds of companies previewed products before the show floor opens on January 6.</p><p>Samsung once again dominated the early conversation with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-the-biggest-announcements-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059466.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">First Look event</a>, using the stage to outline how it sees AI shaping everything from TVs to home appliances in the year ahead. Rather than focusing on individual specs, Samsung framed its 2026 lineup around adaptive experiences, with screens and devices designed to respond more intelligently to their environment and the people using them. TVs  remained the centerpiece, with updates like the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB model</a> aimed at improving picture quality, content discovery and personalization through AI-driven tools.</p><p>Among the more concrete pieces of tech tied to Samsung’s CES run was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">The Freestyle+</a>, a successor to the company’s portable projector that doubles down on AI-powered picture optimization, brighter output and smarter calibration for different surfaces. The unit also supports immersive audio features and syncs with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Samsung’s soundbars</a> for a more complete entertainment package. The company further bolstered its audio portfolio with the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Music Studio wireless speakers</a>, which offer an eye-catching design.</p><p>Samsung’s broader display strategy was also on show: Samsung Display revealed next-generation QD-OLED panels capable of peak brightness up to 4,500 nits, which are expected to be used in TVs and monitors that debut on the show floor, and introduced new concepts illustrating how OLED tech can blend into future AI-enhanced lifestyles.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c3537010-e9f5-11f0-bdef-1bc2c48a4dbd" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c3537010-e9f5-11f0-bdef-1bc2c48a4dbd" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="undefined" data-uuid="6b7081c9-5c32-3369-bf28-36b5d3dad8b1"/><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Software also played a role in Samsung’s early messaging. The company confirmed that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Google Photos will be coming to Samsung TVs</a> later this year, bringing photo libraries and Memories directly into the living room. It’s the kind of addition that doesn’t grab headlines in the same way as new hardware, but it’s exactly the type of update that quietly shapes how people actually use their TVs regularly.</p><p>Outside of Samsung’s event, CES Unveiled — the convention’s kickoff mini-show — offered an early look at what smaller companies and startups are bringing to Las Vegas this year. The show floor was packed with a familiar mix of near-ready consumer products and more experimental ideas, spanning robotics, smart home gear, health tech and personal electronics. Companion-style robots, updated AR glasses and AI-powered household gadgets were common sights, reflecting broader trends that are likely to show up repeatedly across the main halls this week.</p><p>Unveiled is rarely about big-name launches, but it often reveals where the industry’s attention is drifting. This year, that meant a noticeable emphasis on AI-assisted hardware that blends into everyday routines, whether that’s home devices designed to act more autonomously or personal tech that prioritizes context and convenience over raw performance.</p><p>LG also kicked off its pre-show efforts with some notable display news that’s certain to shape conversations on the CES floor. The company reintroduced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ultra-thin Wallpaper OLED evo W6 TV</a>, a panel that sits just 9mm deep and can be mounted flush against a wall, boasting improvements in brightness and color accuracy with Hyper Radiant Color Technology and support for FreeSync and G-Sync.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" style="height:1327px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV" data-uuid="c57ab13f-a9b0-4a6e-b9be-88d620777eda"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>LG’s display lineup extends into the PC space too, where the division plans to debut a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">27-inch OLED gaming panel</a> hitting a 720Hz refresh rate and response times as low as 0.02 ms. On the lifestyle front, the Gallery TV aims to compete more directly with Samsung’s art-style screens by combining a specialized anti-glare panel with an expanding Gallery+ service that brings thousands of artworks to the living room.</p><p>Some CES-related announcements also landed ahead of Sunday, underscoring how stretched the show’s news cycle has become. Samsung and LG both shared display and ecosystem updates in the days leading up to January 4, ensuring their products were already part of the CES conversation before pre-show events even began.</p><p>Sunday’s announcements served as a clear warm-up for what’s coming next. Monday, January 5, marks the start of press day, when major companies will take the stage for individual conferences and a large number of embargoes are expected to lift. Then, on Tuesday, January 6, CES officially opens its doors, shifting the focus from presentations to hands-on demos and real-world impressions.</p><p>We’ll be updating <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">this recap</a> as more news breaks, but if Sunday was any indication, CES 2026 is already moving fast — and the show hasn’t even started yet.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ces-2026-opening-night-recap-all-the-early-news-you-missed-from-samsung-and-lg-142611832.html?src=rss]]></description>

With older iPhones, the charging speed tops out at 15W.

<p>The Lego Group is set to host its very first press conference at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">CES 2026</a> later today — but exactly what it plans to unveil is still under wraps. The iconic toy brick maker has offered no clues about what&#39;s on the agenda, leaving speculation wide open, from new video games to Formula 1 race cars.</p>
<p>Unlike nearly every other press event at CES today, however, Lego&#39;s event is not being livestreamed. Thankfully, Engadget is here to bridge the gap: Our own Nate Ingraham will be in the room at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, liveblogging the event in real-time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lego CES press conference is scheduled for Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET (10AM PT). We have confirmed with Lego reps that this event will not be officially livestreamed, so we&#39;re sharing our real-time impressions right here. Our stream starts at noon ET, an hour before the official event.</p>

<p>Thus far, Lego hasn&#39;t shared any public info about its CES plans, so we&#39;re largely in the dark as to what to expect.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is working even more Gemini features into Google TV at CES 2026. The company demoed how the AI assistant would work on its TV platform <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/gemini-ai-is-coming-to-google-tv-devices-in-2025-making-them-easier-to-talk-to-160003805.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">at last year&#39;s show</a>, and this time, it&#39;s expanding the AI&#39;s features to make it easier to do things like adjust your TV&#39;s settings or edit photos.</p><p>The ability to view photos stored in Google Photos has long been a feature of Google TV, but as part of this new update, Gemini will be able to do a lot more with them, too. Google says Gemini will be able to search your Google Photos library for specific people and moments, and remix those photos into different styles or compile them into a custom slideshow. Using Google&#39;s Veo and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Nano Banana</a> models, you&#39;ll also be able to ask Gemini to create entirely new media from scratch.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Device_Controls.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Device_Controls.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Gemini adjust picture settings through Google TV." data-uuid="fc31e661-e9ae-4d78-bbb1-3adc6a4d5e0a"/><figcaption>Gemini can adjust TV settings as part of the new update.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>When you don&#39;t want to spend time digging through menus, Google says Gemini will also be able to adjust picture and sound settings for you based on a natural language request. Rather than asking for your brightness to be set to a specific level, simply telling Gemini that &quot;the screen is too dim&quot; will be enough to prompt the AI to adjust the image. Gemini&#39;s ability to display information and answer questions through your TV is also expanding. The AI will now use a TV-friendly, &quot;visually rich framework&quot; to answer questions and explain topics, pulling on high-resolution images and video. When you need even more information, clicking on &quot;Dive deeper&quot; under a Gemini response will prompt the AI to create &quot;narrated, interactive overviews&quot; of whatever you want to learn more about.</p><p>Google only <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-for-tv-is-rolling-out-to-the-google-tv-streamer-220448361.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">recently rolled out Gemini</a> to its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/google-tv-streamer-review-a-great-side-piece-for-your-tv-with-a-dash-of-smart-home-chops-and-inessential-ai-160034550.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Google TV Streamer</a>, and it sounds like it could be a bit before these new features are widely available. Google says the new Gemini update will arrive on TCL TVs running Google TV first, before rolling out to &quot;other Google TV devices over the coming months.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html?src=rss]]></description>

In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384"><ins>post on X</ins></a>, the company says the 8BitDo FlipPad will debut in the summer of 2026 and will be compatible with iOS and Android devices. It also mentions the peripheral is &quot;officially supported by Apple.&quot;</p>
<p>The post doesn&#39;t give too much away, as the company will be premiering the FlipPad at CES this week. A short, rendered video shows that the mobile gaming peripheral connects via USB-C, and then flips upward on a hinge to lay flat against the bottom portion of a user&#39;s phone screen. In the rendering, we can see a directional pad, purple ABXY buttons, select, start buttons and six more unlabeled buttons.</p>

If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JBL just revealed a bunch of new earbuds at CES 2026, suiting just about every ear canal out there. First up, there are several new additions to the Endurance line of sports-adjacent earbuds.</p>
<p>The baddest of the bunch is likely the Endurance Zone, which offers 32 hours of battery life and fast charging. They include the company&#39;s proprietary OpenSound technology, which directs audio signals to the ears without blocking the ear canal. This means that wearers should be able to detect ambient noise during a workout. This is extremely helpful when someone is asking to use the machine because you&#39;ve been staring at your phone instead of doing reps.</p>

<p>The Zone earbuds also offer multipoint connections, earhooks for stability and an exterior designed for long-term durability. These buds cost $180 and will be available later this month.</p>
<p>The Endurance Peak 4 earbuds don&#39;t integrate with OpenSound, but do offer superior battery life to the Zone. They can get up to 48 hours per charge, when factoring in the included charging case. They cost $130 and will also be purchasable later in January.</p>

<p>The Endurance Pace wraparound earbuds are a fairly budget-friendly way to get access to that OpenSound tech. They cost just $90, but the battery maxes out at 10 hours, as there&#39;s no charging case. Look for these later this month.</p>
<p>The Endurance Run 3 are extremely budget-friendly earbuds, with prices ranging from $25 to $35. These are wired devices, with a USB-C model and a 3.5mm model. They&#39;ll be available in February.</p>
<p>The JBL Sense Pro also includes OpenSound and can play spatial content. The battery and case lasts up to 38 hours and there&#39;s wireless charging. These are designed for hi-fi audio, so they include redesigned drivers and a bass boosting algorithm. There are four integrated microphones for making calls. These earbuds cost $200, with availability in March.</p>

<p>The JBL Sense Lite earbuds, as the name suggests, are extremely light and made to be worn all day. They include OpenSound tech, 32 hours of battery life and touch controls. These buds will also be available in March, with a price of $150.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the Soundgear Clips. As the name suggests, these lightweight earbuds clip to the ears. They also use the company&#39;s OpenSound air-conduction technology. The earbuds are fairly striking, with a metallic tint and translucent finish. The battery life clocks in at 32 hours and can do fast charging. They cost $150 and will also go on sale this March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-just-announced-a-bunch-of-new-earbuds-at-ces-130044239.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For CES this year, JBL has added three new gaming headsets to its JBL Quantum product lineup. JBL Quantum 950X is the latest set of flagship headphones from the brand, with 50mm carbon dynamic drivers and features such as spatial audio, 3D head tracking and active noise cancelation. The set is compatible with PC, consoles and mobile platforms through 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 5.3 or wired connection. The 950X has a pair of hot-swappable and rechargeable batteries that give 50 hours of playtime. It comes with a 6mm cardioid boom microphone that uses AI noise reduction to keep background sounds out of in-game communication. The headset will retail for $400 and will be available starting in April 2026.</p><p>The other two new products are the JBL Quantum 650X and the JBL Quantum 250. The wireless 650X also has 50mm carbon dynamic drivers, spatial sound and the same connectivity options as the 950X. It has an expected battery life of 45 hours. The less expensive 650X will also be available in April and will retail for $200. The JBL Quantum 250 is a wired headset with many of the same drivers and features as the other two products. It has black and white model options, and will cost $80. This third model will be available starting March 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-launches-a-trio-of-gaming-headsets-for-ces-130000929.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s not the first of its kind, but a few key differences set Fraimic apart from other E Ink art displays. Aura, Switchbot and others have something similar. But unlike other versions, this one requires no subscription, lets you swap out the surrounding frame and doesn’t require an app to upload the art. Instead, a built-in mic picks up your idea, sends it to OpenAI and creates an image that pops up in a few moments on the screen. The on-board accelerometer even knows whether the device is in landscape or portrait orientation, and applies the correct format.</p>
<p>A purchase of the Fraimic comes with 100 free AI creations per year, and if that’s not enough, you can buy more. But if, like me, you don’t consider the images a machine’s brain smashes together to actually be art, the Fraimic also allows you to upload your own images via the brand’s website. And should that website ever go away, your device isn’t obsolete, as it can also handle local uploads. </p>

<p>The other qualities that make E Ink displays intriguing are all here. These screens are similar to what you get with a color <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ereader</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">E Ink tablet</a> and, like those devices, only require power when changing what’s displayed. This one has enough juice to last for years — even if you swap out the image once per day. </p>
<p>It uses a 13-inch <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Spectra6" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Spectra 6</a> E Ink display, which has a resolution of about 200 dots per inch. If you’ve seen a color epaper tablet or ereader, you’ll have an idea of what the image looks like. It’s not high-definition and the colors aren’t super vibrant, but the effect is pleasantly subdued and, for the right images, looks properly arty. </p>
<p>Even under the always-too-bright glare of the CES show floor lights, the images managed to look lush and saturated. With the right (human-generated) art, I’d be happy to hang this in my living room. </p>
<p>The standard-sized display will run you $399, which is $100 cheaper than Aura’s similarly sized device and $50 more than SwitchBot’s. Pre-orders for Fraimic are open now and units are expected to ship in spring of this year. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Daily life can get loud, and meditation apps offer a simple way to carve out a little breathing room. You do not need experience to start, and you do not need to commit to long sessions either. Most apps guide you through short practices that help with focus, sleep and stress, making it easy to build a routine even on busy days.<br><br>There are plenty of meditation apps to choose from, each with its own style and approach. Some focus on mindfulness basics, others offer structured programs and a few add community features for accountability. I tested the most popular options to find the best meditation apps for anyone who wants more calm and clarity in their day.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-meditation-apps">How we tested meditation apps</h2> 
<p>Every brain is different, so I did not rate these apps based on if they sync up with my preferred meditation style. First and foremost, I looked for apps that cater to various methods and those that offer guided meditations that go beyond what’s free on YouTube. All of the items on this list are available on both Android and iOS, so you won’t have to worry about something being only for iPhone owners.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Of course, there’s lots of free stuff out there, from podcasts and videos on YouTube to audio tracks on streaming services. You can even find guided breathing sessions on an Apple Watch or Fitbit, as well as meditations in Fitness+, Samsung Health or any number of workout video providers. For this guide, I focused on apps that stood out in some way. I liked apps with huge libraries of guided meditations and those that offer additional mindfulness activities, like yoga routines. I also looked for easy-to-use apps with well-designed layouts. You don’t want to start your meditation journey with a clunky app that actually increases anxiety.</p> 
<p>The most important thing with meditation is to keep doing it, so I awarded points for clever gamification elements, simple social network integration and anything else that encourages repeat visits. Finally, I considered extra features that set an app apart from the glut of competitors out there. For example, some meditation apps offer novel ways to track your progress, access to yoga routines and a whole lot more.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, each of these apps has its strengths. But if installing an app or using a device is not how you prefer to meditate, you can always turn off your phone and find a quiet room or environment. For those of us who need a little help from a digital guru, though, here are our favorite apps for meditation.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-meditation-gear-we-tested">Other meditation gear we tested</h2> 
<p>Brain-tracking wearables have been around for years, but there are some newer devices that have been tailor-made for meditators. These gadgets track the brain during meditations and offer real-time feedback. It’s a real boon for the data-obsessed, but also a real bank account drainer, with some gadgets costing thousands of dollars. I took two of the more-popular options for a spin to see what they’d make of my brain.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sensai-neurofeedback-system">Sens.ai Neurofeedback System</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://sens.ai/">Sens.ai</a> is a weird contraption that not only claims to track brainwaves, but gives real-time feedback to “teach” people how to meditate and enter a flow state. The device involves a giant headset that’s stuffed with brainwave sensors that detect beta, alpha, theta and gamma waves, in addition to heart-rate sensors. It also comes with a truly bizarre companion gadget that uses light stimulation (transcranial photobiomodulation) to keep an eye on focus and attention levels. The whole thing is combined with an app that keeps track of dozens of data metrics and allows access to various guided meditations.</p> 
<p>I’m as surprised as you to say that this thing appears to work, with some caveats. It’s uncanny how well it monitors the brain during meditations. If I got lost in a thought spiral about lasagna at six minutes in, sure enough, there would be a dip in analytics at the six-minute mark. It’s also fairly easy to use, despite a process that involves wetting a number of electrodes. As magical as the accurate brain-tracking seems to be, however, I wasn’t as keen on the actual training portion, which often involves staring at a screen throughout the entirety of the practice. It’s also not for the financial faint of heart, as the Sens.ai device costs $1,500.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-neorhythm-omnipemf">NeoRhythm Omnipemf</h3> 
<p>NeoRhythm’s Omnipemf <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://caputron.com/products/neorhythm">is another wearable</a> to help people get into that ever-elusive flow state. It doesn’t track your brain, but rather floods it with electromagnetic fields at specific frequencies to make it more susceptible to meditation and focus. This is supposed to prime your brain for the meditative state and, in theory, make it easier to capture that zen. However, I didn’t get much from it, other than a placebo-esque buzzing in my head.</p> 
<p>To use it, you simply pop on the wearable and go about your day. You aren’t tied to an app, so you can meditate in whatever way you like. There are multiple modes that go beyond meditation, as this thing is supposed to help with focus, pain relief and sleep. I’d wait for some peer-reviewed studies, however, before buying this.</p>

This time, it has three devices to show off: the “Light Straight + Multi-styler” as well as the helpfully named LED Face Mask and LED Eye Mask.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t let the unassuming names mislead you. These three products actually harbor some unique traits. The Light Straight (and multi-styler, which I’m going to just call the Light Straight from here on), for instance, uses infrared light to help generate the heat required to style your hair. Meanwhile, the LED Face Mask is different from those made by companies like Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/shark-joins-the-high-tech-skincare-mask-war-with-an-impressive-ces-2025-opening-shot-214804543.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Shark</a>. Instead of fairly hard shells that sit rigidly on your face, L&#39;Oréal’s version looks to be pliable and thin.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven’t seen this in person yet, though I do intend to do so as soon as possible, but the pictures of the LED Eye Mask look, and I mean this in the best way, <em>ridonkulous. </em>Not only do they appear supple, but they also seem to be transparent, with bulbs and wires you can see inside. In some of the images that the company provided, the masks are completely awash in red as the lights are on. In others, only parts of it are red. One of them even shows the masks sitting in a little carrying case and they almost look like wireless earbuds. I haven’t seen any photos of the LED Face Mask but I can imagine they’d be fairly similar to these.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-7.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-7.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The L&#39;Or&#xe9;al LED Eye Mask in a carrying case" data-uuid="6c0506c9-5dfd-41cc-954d-a4e23a1e2c2b"/><figcaption>The L&#39;Oréal LED Eye Mask in a carrying case</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">L&#39;Oréal </div></figure><p>According to the press release, this “ultra-thin, flexible silicone mask” is currently “in prototype form” and was developed in collaboration with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ismartdevelopments.com/about/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">LED solutions company iSmart</a>. The company said this mask “delivers light directly to the face” in 10-minute automatically timed sessions. That’s not too different from existing red light masks, but L’Oréal said it believes “the key to the mask’s effectiveness is its advanced, transparent support, which integrates a skin-safe microcircuit to precisely control the emission of two selected wavelengths of light—red light (630 nm) and near-infrared light (830 nm).”</p><p>Since the mask is only launching in 2027, there aren’t details yet on pricing and availability, though the company’s global vice president of tech and open innovation Guive Balooch told Engadget that it would be a premium product that would sit somewhere below the highest priced offerings currently out there.</p><p>One of my problems with full-face LED masks is that my skin always feels too parched under them, because you have to use them on clean, dry skin for 10 minutes at a time. Balooch told me that L&#39;Oréal would have a serum developed to be used with its mask that would help with that, while also improving the effectiveness of the light treatment.</p><p>That certainly is intriguing, and Balooch indicated that creating formulations that are designed to work with devices like the LED masks is a future direction for the company.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Light-Straight_3_16x9.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Light-Straight_3_16x9.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="A pair of hands using the L&#39;Or&#xe9;al Light Straight and multi-styler on a person&#39;s hair.

According to the company’s press release, hair straighteners with “ordinary heating places can reach temperatures of 400°F and higher—above the threshold at which keratin denatures, leading to weakened cuticles, breakage and reduced shine.” For context, I used to turn my flatiron all the way up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit to tame my tresses (though these days I find a more reasonable 330 degrees is good enough).</p><p>L’Oréal says the Light Straight and its “patented infrared light technology” can “help provide exceptional styling results at lower temperatures, to better protect the health of the hair.” The device’s glass plates never exceed 320 degrees, and the company says its testing found that the Light Straight is three times faster and leaves hair twice as smooth as “leading premium hair stylers.” I’m not sure how you would quantify smoothness, but I’m hopeful the results do pan out in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>The Light Straight uses near-infrared light that L’Oréal says “penetrates deeply into hair fibers” to “reshape internal hydrogen bonds.” It also has sensors onboard with “built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning” to adapt to your gestures “to maximize individual experience.” I’m not sure what that means, but I hope to find out more this week at CES. Given the Light Straight doesn’t launch till 2027, it’s not surprising that pricing and other details aren’t yet available. But for now, I’m keen to see companies continue to investigate novel, hopefully healthier ways for us to look and feel beautiful.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/loreals-ces-2026-beauty-devices-include-a-skin-like-flexible-led-mask-070000576.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We kicked off 2026 with the first press conference of the year, and what better company than Samsung, prolific event-haver, to open with. Here <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-big-january-conference-120000956.html">at CES 2026</a>, the tech giant is held a presentation called &quot;The First Look&quot; to showcase its home products and a milieu of AI-infused announcements.</p>
<p>Many of the products announced on stage were not actually new, but instead had been dripped out by Samsung recently. Like its minimalist Music Studio speakers or new Micro RGB TVs. We did get a closer look a previously undisclosed set, a flagship 130-inch Micro RGB TV framed by a giant metal easel with embedded speakers. It&#39;s one of the most striking sets we&#39;ve ever seen, but it&#39;s much more in the realm of concept than reality. (That&#39;s not to say they won&#39;t sell it, just that we&#39;ve heard no plans and if they do it will be hideously expensive.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d" style="height:1847px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV." data-uuid="f84e5a7b-a6c3-35c0-b569-b24d6f0f1015"><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>As for the rest of Samsung&#39;s Micro RGB TV line, that may actually be slightly more affordable. The company released its first set last year for an eye-watering $30,000, but that was a 115-inch proof of concept. This year it&#39;ll be <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">offering TVs in more reasonable sizes</a>, including the ever-popular 55-, 65- and 75-inch sets. We don&#39;t know pricing on those but those smaller models will definitely be cheaper than $30,000. For those that want something bigger, there&#39;ll also be 85-, 100- and 115-inch models. As before, the Micro RGB range will offer a purported 100% coverage of the Rec.2020 color space, which is something that even the highest-end OLEDs can&#39;t match.</p>
<p>While they may have been announced prior to CES, we did get <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html">a few minutes in person with Samsung&#39;s Music Studio speakers</a> in the demo area after the big show. The Music Studio 5 and 7 are wireles speakers supporting both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, while the Studio 7 has a 3.1.1 setup with top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers to give an &quot;immersive 3D audio experience.&quot; For all of that, it&#39;s clear the main draw of these new speakers is the design, which is definitely striking.</p>
<p>Another thing from those heady pre-CES days was the Freestyle+, the latest attempt at a micro projector from Samsung. Like previous Freestyle models, it&#39;s small and unobtrusive, but this one is a little brighter and has &quot;smarter AI capabilities.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Freestyle+ reflects Samsung’s vision to create displays that adapt naturally to how people live and move between spaces,” said Hun Lee, Executive Vice President of the Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “By combining true portability with intelligent AI that optimizes both the viewing environment and the content itself, The Freestyle+ makes it easier to enjoy a consistent, high-quality experience wherever you are.”</p>

<p>There were even products that Samsung didn&#39;t mention on stage that we then found in the demo area. Like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html">Samsung HW-QS90H soundbar</a>, a new skew on its popular HW-QS90 line that targets those of us that would rather not have a subwoofer sitting in our living rooms. It&#39;s an all-in-one 7.1.2 soundbar with 13 drivers, including four (we&#39;re assuming) woofers for its &quot;Quad Bass Woofer system.&quot; Or the&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was really that for the big announcements. The rest of the stage show was focused on how Samsung thinks (or really, at this point, insists) AI is going to make all of its products more useful. Demos included using AI noise cancelling to turn off the commentators in a soccer match, using AI to watch recipes on your fridge door, using AI to wash your clothes better (?) and... to cut a long story short, Samsung would very much appreciate it if you could please use AI.</p>
<p>We&#39;re expecting to see and hear more from Samsung during CES, but for now you can find all of our news stories and more detailed hands-on impressions below, or if you want to relieve the event in extruciating detail there&#39;s the livestream replay too. (Don&#39;t worry, though the video is three hours long the event itself  was a tight hour.)</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung announced its newest portable projector ahead of its First Look showcase at CES 2026, but you might have been a little confused as to what’s changed. The company says the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html"><ins>Freestyle+</ins></a> is nearly twice as bright as the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2023-freestyle-portable-projector-cloud-gaming-edge-blending-031336930.html">2022 Freestyle projector</a>, rated at 230 ISO lumens, which was pretty underwhelming. The new Freestyle+ can output at 430 ISO lumens. If this is the first you’re hearing of ISO Lumens, it’s an internationally standardized rating for projectors, intended to standardize manufacturers&#39; claims of brightness.</p>
<p>It still looks very similar to its predecessors, with 160 degrees of rotation that makes it easy to set up in most homes, Airbnbs or meeting rooms. Samsung added support for Q-Symphony, allowing you to connect it to the company’s soundbars, if you conveniently have one nearby. While the sound quality of its built-in speaker was hard to test in the middle of a post-keynote trade show floor, you’ll probably want to augment the built-in speaker, if only because it’s so small.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vision AI, mentioned several times during Samsung’s CES keynote, is also built into the portable projector. You can summon Bixby to adjust settings and whatever you’re watching. Based on the demos I saw, you’ll need to speak into the remote to access Bixby.</p>
<p>Other improvements bring the projector into 2026, with keystone correction and focus. The Freestyle+’s AI OptiScreen can calibrate projections to different wall surfaces and colors to improve visibility even on your most vivid walls.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6825cde0-e9f6-11f0-bb3b-f9df6ed116f0" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6825cde0-e9f6-11f0-bb3b-f9df6ed116f0" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung Freestyle+ hands-on" data-uuid="4d41f88b-2d61-34b3-8b24-586eb77215ea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The updated 3D Auto Keystone corrects distortion even when projecting onto uneven or non-flat surfaces, such as corners, curtains or angled walls. It’s hard to put into words, but pointing the Freestyle+ to a corner, or at an undulating curtain, and watching the image morph and contort was almost hypnotic. The premise is that you can point this at any area of your home (or even, say, the side of a tent), and the 3D Auto Keystone will flatten the image in seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also Screen Fit, which automatically adjusts the image to match a projector screen size. The Freestyle+ can project up to a 100-inch 1080p image, at maximum. However, Wall Calibration might be the most technically impressive in a device this size. It detects and analyzes the color of the projection surface and recalibrates the image’s color tone to minimize the effect. It can even detect and match a wall pattern to reduce visual interference, which worked well in person. The Samsung spokesperson used the aforementioned Bixby voice commands to calibrate the screen.</p>
<p>If there’s still something to address, it’s that this portable projector must be plugged in to operate. When that can be either a power bank or a wall outlet, it seems a bit cheeky to call it portable.</p>
<p>Samsung typically announces prices and launch dates once the CES dust has settled, but it&#39;s set to arrive in the first half of 2026. Previous iterations cost around $900, but early impressions suggest it’s a versatile, petite projector.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amid endless AI hype and a guest visit from the CEO of Hartford Steam Boiler (?!), Samsung had a big surprise for us tonight at CES 2026: A massive 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It’s so large, it’s suspended by a large metal stand that surrounds the entire screen,  which also lets you tilt the screen just a bit. (For the Samsung diehards, it’s basically a reinvention of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/part%E2%85%A1-a-timeless-gallery-design-that-redefines-the-space-we-live-in" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">“timeless gallery” stand from 2013</a>.)  I imagine bringing this TV home would be like Bart Simpson adopting his beloved elephant Stampy: Your pets would be terrified, and your family would probably be annoyed at this television dominating so much of your home.</p><p>But boy, it sure looks amazing in person. Just like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">LG’s Micro RGB set</a>, it’s using an evolved form of Mini LED technology that allows for far better color accuracy and richness. As I fought through the crowds of Samsung’s CES First Look event to catch a glimpse of it, I couldn’t help but notice how everyone just looked a bit stunned, like the monkeys from <em>2001</em>  seeing the monolith for the first time.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-2.jpg" style="height:1343px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the side." data-uuid="706563cd-8282-402b-a3ce-1f3fe7c35725"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the side.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung representatives were clear that this Micro RGB set was only a concept of what the company could do with the technology, it’s not an actual product it plans to ship. In another demo, Samsung took the 130-inch screen and mounted it directly on a wall (below). Of course, it still looked stunning. I also learned that if you wanted to wall mount the “timeless gallery” stand concept, you actually have to mount the entire stand to the wall, since it’s part of the TV’s speaker system.</p><p>Samsung didn’t have too many details about the technical aspects of the 130-inch Micro RGB TV, but it did shout buzzwords at us during its announcement. it’s powered by the company’s “Micro RGB AI Engine Pro” processor, which includes “Micro RGB Color Booster Pro” and “Micro RGB HDR Pro” technology, using AI to “enhance dull tones and refine contrast, delivering vivid color and subtle detail across bright and dark scenes alike for realism and picture fidelity.”</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-4.jpg" style="height:1297px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV mounted in a wall." data-uuid="f15f1a3b-0d6b-4489-8c32-c468fac6357f"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV mounted in a wall.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Micro RGB set also sports the company’s Glare Free technology to reduce reflections, and it supports HDR 10+ Advanced and the company’s Eclipsa Audio. It can also tap into Samsung’s Vision AI Companion for conversational search, as well as Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity.</p><p>But of course, those details really don’t matter, because you won’t be able to buy the 130-inch Micro RGB TV in its current form. We were impressed by last year’s 115-inch model, but its $30,000 price didn’t make it feasible for anyone but the ultra-rich. And those folks would be better off investing in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-110000-microled-tv-in-this-economy-144340352.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Samsung’s own Micro LED sets</a>, which offer the benefits of OLED that Micro RGB does not. (Sure, those TVs start at $110,000, but for that’s not exactly a huge leap for those with deep pockets.)   </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-3.jpg" style="height:1281px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the rear." data-uuid="10d215f9-9095-4fbc-8e17-f053fdac0178"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV from the rear.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In addition to its annual soundbar updates, Samsung <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">debuted two new home speakers</a> at CES 2026. The Music Studio 5 and 7 are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi units designed to blend in with your home decor thanks to their minimalist look. They certainly don’t look like your typical speakers, and Samsung has packed them with features that it says will ensure optimal sound quality from each one.&nbsp;</p><p>The Music Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and two tweeters, and a sound profile that’s optimized by AI Dynamic Bass Control. The design is an interesting interplay between a circle and a square, but the speaker delivers crisp, clear sound — even in the roar of a CES demo area. The Music Studio 5 will also come in a smattering of colors, which could lend a pop to a bookshelf. Controls line the top edge, including one-touch access to Spotify.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sound-studio-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sound-studio-4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung Music Studio 7" data-uuid="fe0cf0de-0c72-440c-be41-f4034346aa76"/><figcaption>Samsung Music Studio 7</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re looking for something more robust, the Music Studio 7 is a 3.1.1-channel unit that’s capable of four-direction spatial audio and high-resolution listening. Samsung says you can enjoy tunes at up to up to 24-bit/96kHz and the speaker can be used as part of a turntable setup. The sound here is more robust as I heard noticeably more bass from the 7 than on the 5. The various control buttons are up top here as well, positioned near the front of the speaker for easy access. </p><p>You can also use up to four Music Studio speakers as a surround sound setup in your living room. I listened to a brief demo where Samsung was using four Music Studio 7 units in a makeshift home theater. This combo provided great immersion, with lots of detail in the directional sound in the clips being broadcast on the connected TV. Samsung also says you can use up to 10 Music Studio speakers for audio only.</p><p>The company didn’t announce any pricing details yet, but that’s likely to come just before the Music Studio speakers are available for purchase. That date is TBD as well. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re used to Samsung <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-debuts-the-qs700f-soundbar-and-updates-the-q990-at-ces-2025-030042257.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">updating its Q990 soundbar at CES every year</a>, and 2026 is no different. However, the company also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">debuted the HW-QS90H</a>: a new all-in-one option that Samsung says won’t require a standalone subwoofer due to its Quad Bass Woofer system. The QS90H offers 7.1.2-channel audio with 13 total drivers. Before the show properly kicks off, we got to listen to the new soundbar for a quick judge of its merits.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing I noticed about the QS90H is its impressive bass performance. Most of the time when a company claims its soundbar doesn’t need a subwoofer, that proves to be untrue. But even in the chaos of a noisy demo area, I could clearly hear the bassy thump coming from the QS90H’s built-in subwoofers. For once, I think would-be buyers could get by without a sub, especially in smaller living rooms. </p><p>Samsung achieved this with two of those Quad woofers. These drivers push air in two directions rather than just one, which helps with the extra low-end tone. The company didn’t sacrifice clarity either. The nine additional drivers, positioned for front, side, wide and up firing sound, provide the clear detail I’ve come to expect from Samsung.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/qs90h-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/qs90h-1.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung QS90H soundbar" data-uuid="3a472cfd-3a80-4af6-a3d2-b62412cd5a3b"/><figcaption>Samsung QS90H soundbar</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>The QS90H also features Samsung’s Convertible Fit Design technology that debuted on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs700f-soundbar-review-sophisticated-design-automatic-adjustments-180035549.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">QS700F</a> last year. This tool allows you to sit the soundbar flat on a shelf or mantle, or rotate it to mount on the wall. Built-in sensors automatically adjust the driver performance for each orientation, so that sound quality isn’t affected by the selected positioning. During my demo, I didn’t notice any difference in performance when the orientation changed. In fact, the QS90H looks a lot like the QS700F on the outside, with similar grille patters and control designs. </p><p>Samsung didn’t announce pricing or availability tonight, but that’s likely to come just prior to any on-sale date. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG usually announces its CES TV lineup well ahead of the show, but this year the company had a surprise at CES 2026: The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">return of its ultra-thin &quot;Wallpaper&quot; TV</a>. Now it&#39;s toting a gorgeous OLED screen and wireless connectivity, and it&#39;s about as thin as a pencil. We got a chance to check out the Wallpaper TV in action during a CES preview event, as well as the previously announced Gallery and Micro RGB sets. LG still has its typically OLED and LED sets around, but it&#39;s clear that 2026 will be filled with intriguing TVs for a variety of consumers.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" style="height:1396px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV" data-uuid="58f3d374-411f-4f30-ace0-0a163a26875f"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="831aff76-954b-413f-ad53-1c525ef027ff">The Wallpaper TV (LG W6)</h2><p>If money were no object, I&#39;d want a 100-inch LG Wallpaper TV in my family room immediately. It looks shockingly thin in person — almost as if it&#39;s some sort of sci-fi prop — and it delivers the rich colors and dark levels we expect from OLED. Cable management is also a cinch, since it requires just a single power cable. The A/V inputs are handled by LG&#39;s One Connect box, which you can position wirelessly up to 10 meters away from the TV. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" style="height:1333px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear" data-uuid="76d95849-a1b3-4ee2-b3e8-944800c0dba6"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The LG W6 combines the best of LG&#39;s OLED technology, including &quot;Hyper Radiant Color&quot; for improved black levels and color, &quot;Brightness Booster Ultra&quot; to crank up luminance 3.9 times more than conventional OLEDs and a reflection free screen material. LG&#39;s Alpha 9 Gen 3 processor beefs up its performance, and its NPU also helps to improve upscaling and overall image performance. (And yes, you can also access generative AI features via Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.)</p><p>All of that adds up to one of the most remarkable TVs I&#39;ve seen in years. I haven&#39;t been too enamored with other TV gimmicks lately, like everything trying to mimic Samsung&#39;s The Frame, or the usless 8K sets. But a super-thin wireless TV with the best OLED panel available? That&#39;s the stuff dreams are made of. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" style="height:1253px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV" data-uuid="3419e13f-8e77-4dd1-8a33-97994b44a84c"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="c4158606-b48b-431e-b6d6-e9e573054349">The Gallery TV competes with Samsung’s Frame</h2><p>While LG has made Gallery TVs before, in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2026 it&#39;s making a more concerted effort</a> to take on Samsung&#39;s popular Frame TV. LG says the new sets were designed with the help of museum curators, which helps the &quot;Gallery Mode&quot; adjust brightness and contrast to specific works of art. They also ship with magnetic frame-like bezels, and they have anti-reflective screens to help make the art shine. </p><p>In person, the new Gallery TV looks fine, though it&#39;s easy to tell that the colors and contrast levels don&#39;t match LG&#39;s premium OLED TVs.  To avoid burn-in issues, these sets feature Mini LED panels. As I noted above, I&#39;m not the core consumer for one of these TVs, but it&#39;s nice to see more competition against Samsung&#39;s Frame TVs. (Despite pioneering the idea of TVs displaying art, the Frame sets are still fairly mediocre when it comes to actually watching TV shows and movies.) </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" style="height:1316px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="72bf06b4-100f-4522-a0be-2025ac961562"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="0b43ff1a-5c6e-434e-b754-a7d35f025952"><strong>Micro RGB looks like a genuine Mini LED upgrade</strong></h2><p>As if we needed more TV acronyms to worry about, say hello to Micro RGB, a new technology built atop Mini LED to cover vastly more color range. Just don&#39;t confuse it with Micro LED, which is the wildly expensive evolutionary step forward for OLED. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">LG already announced its Micro RGB set</a> a few weeks ago, but that didn&#39;t prepare me for standing in front of the 100-inch demo TV it brought to CES. Throughout a variety of clips, colors looked wonderfully rich, and the overall texture of the images looked surprisingly life-like. </p><p>I&#39;d have to compare it to LG&#39;s Wall TV side-by-side to truly see how Micro RGB competes with OLED, but technically OLED should still offer better contrast and black levels, since each of its pixels are self-emissive. But sure, if I couldn&#39;t get a 100-inch Wall TV in my family room, I certainly wouldn&#39;t turn down an enormous Micro RGB. </p><h2 id="c5a82153-d91f-4549-93d2-6ed9c5eee16d"><strong>What about LG&#39;s other OLED TVs?</strong></h2><p>All of the next-generation OLED technology in the wallpaper TV will also make its way into LG&#39;s G6 OLED models, while the new C6 and other lines will see improvements of their own. All I can say is that the new G6 OLED looked impressive, with a noticeably brighter picture and HDR elements compared to G-series OLEDs from several years ago.  </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-lg-w-series-oled-4k.html">Wallpaper TV</a> that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the &quot;world&#39;s thinnest&quot; OLED that&#39;s truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.</p>
<p>Instead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It&#39;s similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-is-not-selling-the-frame-pro-for-cheap-185607096.html">Frame TV lineup</a>. While you won&#39;t have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor&#39;s hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That&#39;s more than three times the thickness, but it&#39;s still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.</p>

<p>The latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG&#39;s third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There&#39;s even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG  specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.</p>
<p>The updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that&#39;s crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync, AMD&#39;s FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you&#39;re not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html">Gallery+</a> feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.</p>

<p>LG didn&#39;t reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn&#39;t offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-28-lgs-77-inch-wallpaper-tv-is-selling-for-the-low-low-price-of-2.html">Wallpaper TV</a>, which cost up to $20,000.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://takway.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Takway</a>, a startup that wants to be the &quot;Nintendo of the AI robot era,&quot; has unveiled a Tamagotchi-like virtual pet at CES 2026 that&#39;s meant to go with you everywhere and develop a unique personality in the process. Sweekar is an AI companion built into a palm-sized toy, a cutesy egg-shaped device with ears and a screen for its face. As with a Tamagotchi, you&#39;ll have to feed and play with it to keep it happy and healthy, and its mood and facial expressions will reflect your care. But this virtual pet will remember your voice and the activities you&#39;ve done together — and once it&#39;s grown up, it will keep itself entertained, go off on its own virtual excursions (kind of like a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/this-self-care-virtual-pet-is-helping-me-get-my-act-together-160027169.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Finch birb</a>) and bring back tales of its adventures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sweekar_product_01_view.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sweekar_product_01_view.png" style="height:720px;width:1280px;" alt="The Sweekar pocket pet being placed into a large brown checkered purse" data-uuid="4ef77bb1-90a5-4e16-bb7d-63cffa4520e0"/><figcaption>The Sweekar pocket pet being placed into a large brown checkered purse</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Takway</div></figure><p>Sweekar comes in pink, yellow and blue, but there will also be the option to switch up the shells and buy silly little outfits for it, because why not. The pocket pet has four life stages, becoming less needy as it grows. </p><p>It starts out as a closed egg for its two-day incubation period, after which it will &quot;break&quot; its shell to reveal a face. From then on, you have to keep it alive with care tasks and attention in order to raise it through the baby and teen stages. Once it&#39;s an adult though, it will be able to care for itself autonomously. That means you no longer run the risk of killing it through neglect. Sweekar is unkillable from Level 51 on. (At least, in the virtual sense. Hardware can always break, and you&#39;ll have to keep it charged).</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lil_friends.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lil_friends.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfit" data-uuid="3caca9cf-6b86-4f44-8c86-2b2815daf753"/><figcaption>Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfit</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>There&#39;s no set price for it just yet, but Sweekar will likely fall within the $100-$150 range once it becomes available.

But while some companies are chasing humanoids that can help you do stuff, there are also a surprising number of robots whose main job is to be cute and keep you company.</p><p>Japanese startup Ludens AI is showing off two extremely adorable robot companions at CES. Cocomo is an autonomous robot pet that can follow you around the house and respond to voice and touch. It has a fuzzy, egg-shaped body, but the version we saw at CES was wearing an orange suit with ears that made it look a bit like a teddy bear. It was moving around on a wheeled base, but it also has tiny legs if you prefer to carry it around and hold it.&nbsp;</p><p>Cocoo&#39;s exterior is meant to stay close to human body temperature at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and the company says it will rise up to 102 degrees in &quot;high contact&quot; situations like hugging it. And while Cocomo can interact and respond to your actions, it &quot;speaks&quot; with hums and other sounds rather than words.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ludens AI brought some very cute robots to CES 2026.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a slew of keyboards and apps that help people learn how to play the piano, but a small company called PopuMusic is showing off an intriguing set of products at CES to make the process easier.  PartyKeys and PartyStudio are a 36-key MIDI keyboard and MIDI / Bluetooth speaker that pair together in seamless fashion. The PartyStudio is particularly interesting because it has a built-in library of 128 instrument tones and more than 50 different drum machine patterns. Naturally, it works with the PartyKeys, but any MIDI keyboard can connect to it and use those sounds. </p><p>The PartyStudio and PartyKeys both use NFC to connect to each other — you can just tap and hold the keyboard up to the speaker for pairing. You can connect up to three devices using MIDI over Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE MIDI) as well as a fourth using a wired connection. If you have more than one keyboard, meanwhile, you can connect them together with NFC as well — you can pair three keyboards together total, giving you a huge 108-key surface to play.</p><p>Both the PartyStudio and PartyKeys have an understated but appealing look to them (they’re available in black or white) and feel quite substantial and well-made. PopuMusic has been releasing hardware via Kickstarters campaigns for a few years now, so even though they’re a relatively small and new company they have some experience in this department. The speaker seems to hit a nice balance of portability and power; it has two tweeters and two woofers and weighs in at 3.75 pounds. It’s about 13.5 inches wide, 5.2 inches tall and 4 inches deep, so it’s not a tiny speaker you’ll just throw in your bag, but it still feels easy to tote around thanks to its attached handle.</p><p>The other trick that the PartyStudio and PartyKeys have is on the software side. Using a companion app, multiple people can play along with a song. The light-up keyboard can show you what to play, and if you have multiple people playing each keyboard can display complimentary parts. It starts with simple three-key chord voicings, but I also saw a demo that used a familiar Guitar Hero-style interface of different notes flying down the screen, making for a more involved and advanced performance.</p><p>The PartyKeys are up for order on Kickstarter now for $199, while the PartyStudio costs $349. The company says they’re on track to ship both products in Q1 of 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/partystudio-is-a-wireless-midi-speaker-with-128-built-in-instrument-sounds-015511003.html?src=rss]]></description>

Instead, it’s launching the AI MindClip, a wearable microphone which records and transcribes every noise to come from your mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>The company isn’t alone, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">many others</a> turning up to CES this year offering devices to log your thoughts through the day. But SwitchBot does hope to distinguish itself from the crowd with an AI which can both summarize and extract useful data from your chats. The company’s representatives said it will use its initiative and create its own reminders based on what it thinks you’ll need to remember. Sadly, we couldn’t get to see it working in person, and we don’t know when it’ll be available or how much it’ll cost.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>But it’ll probably be a little bit cheaper than a chaise lounge.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/switchbot-turned-up-to-ces-with-an-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say-014959824.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Smart locks have a notable inconvenience: running out of power. Lockin, maker of vein-recognition locks, debuted its newest model on the CES floor. It charges wirelessly via an optical infrared beam with a four-meter range.  A small device, connected to a standard outlet inside the house, shoots a beam at the lock, which has a small receptor panel that turns the light into power, sort of like a plug-in sun beaming at a tiny solar array.  The tech carries certifications from two independent organizations, and won’t harm eyeballs or bodies that get in the way of the beam (though if the beam is interrupted, charging stops). </p><p>The lock itself is a mortise lock that will likely require a pro to install, as it’s not just a standard deadbolt replacer. It’s not a standard lock in other ways too, with video and speaker capabilites, AI recognition as well as touchscreen features and vein recognition. </p><p>The tall black rectangle looked sleek (if huge) in person with a pocket-style grip and a rather sizable display on the interior panel. The outer panel has a touchscreen along with two cameras allowing it to act as a doorbell video camera. You can unlock the door via palm, finger vein or 3D facial recognition. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lockin_V7_Max.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lockin_V7_Max.jpg" style="height:1490px;width:2650px;" alt="Lockin V7 Max smart lock" data-uuid="26f0e007-e375-4979-baf2-0adda50fec1e"/><figcaption>Lockin V7 Max smart lock</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lockin</div></figure><p>It’ll feed the video to any of the major smart home eco systems, including those from Google, Apple, Amazon and Samsung. But for general setup and advanced AI features, such as recognizing a package delivery and speaking a canned request to the driver, you’d use Lockin’s own app. </p><p>I can’t imagine this high-end do-everything lock will be cheap, and indeed the price is currently undisclosed, but units should start shipping in July or August of this year. There’s a cheaper version of the lock, with the same wireless charging capability but without the video features, that’ll sell for $350 and will be available in April. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lockins-everlasting-vein-recognizing-smart-lock-doorbell-cam-combo-is-peak-ces-013431113.html?src=rss]]></description>

While the CES show floor doesn't officially open until Tuesday, January 6, Las Vegas is already abuzz with various pre-show events, including the CES Unveiled mini show and Samsung's First Look press conference, scheduled for late Sunday. Nearly all day Monday will be comprised of more press conferences from the likes of LG, Intel, NVIDIA and Sony. And that doesn't include the product demos, announcements and networking that will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. Engadget is covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.</p><p>More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.</p><h2 id="cbc11c13-20f0-4f78-bd1e-8f9d8de8b7b3">The CES 2026 schedule</h2><p>Press conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES.

However, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ces.tech/media-guides/media-days/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">press conference schedule</a> gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. </p><p>On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with "<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059234.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">The First Look</a>," a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's "vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences."&nbsp;Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details).  Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. </p><p>That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5.

But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. </p><p>Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Hisense</a>, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130005307.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Lego</a>.

Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. </p><p>Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Core Ultra Series 3 processors</a>, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html" data-i13n="slk:a keynote;cpos:11;pos:1">a keynote</a> address that closes out the day.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been on the fence about trying the sort of “AR glasses” that, until recently, were called “personal cinemas,” then check this out. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Xreal</a> has turned up to CES 2026 with an updated version of its entry level <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-new-one-series-ar-glasses-use-usb-c-to-connect-with-nearly-any-device-191221387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xreal One glasses</a>, first launched at the end of 2024. The new model, dubbed the 1S (yes, with a numeral rather than the word) gets marginally better specs and $50 knocked from the asking price.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, One is a wearable spatial display that connects over USB-C to any compatible device including smartphones, tablets, laptops and consoles. It has two teeny-tiny displays in the eyecups that, when worn close to the eyes, trick your brain into thinking you’re looking at a big screen. The average would measure in at around 171 inches, but it’s possible to push the view to a screen closer to 500 inches if your eyes are capable of focusing that far.</p>
<p>As for the changes, they’re all firmly in the welcome nip-and-tuck department, boosting many of the original’s key specs. For instance, the 1080p screens have been swapped out for 1200p full HD, while the field of view has gone from 50 degrees to 52. Brightness has been boosted from 600 nits on the old model to 700 nits here, while the aspect ratio has grown from 16x9 to 16x10. But the change Xreal is arguably most proud of is the drop in price, from $499 down to $449.</p>
<p>Certainly, the bustling trade show floor is not the best place to sample the delights of Xreal’s 1S, but it was able to make a fairly persuasive argument as to its value. I was able to view <em>Avatar: One Of The Avatar Movies</em> and my eyes were almost tricked into thinking it was viewing it in a small multiplex cinema room. The usual Xreal strengths — that they don’t cause me eyestrain and offer a compelling degree of immersion — are fully evident here.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company is launching the Xreal Neo, an external battery-cum-DisplayPort hub for your glasses. Inside you’ll find a 10,000mAh power bank to keep your glasses going for longer and, more importantly, offers better connection for your Switch consoles. After all, before now, if you wanted to play with your Switch or Switch 2, you’d need to hook it up to its own dock. With the Neo, however, you can eliminate that from your bag when you’re playing out and about. That’s available as a standalone purchase for $99 which, like the new 1S, are ready to buy right now.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2023, Withings launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-body-scan-connected-health-station-is-amazing-if-inessential-140001021.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Body Scan, a super-premium scale with the sort of tech found in a high-end gym or low-end clinic</a>. It had a six-lead ECG, offered segmented body composition and could monitor your nerve health, among other things. Now the company has rocked up at CES 2026 in Las Vegas with a second-generation model that adds in tests for hypertension and cellular health. Withings hopes the new model will give you even more data you can use to fight against chronic illnesses brought on by our decadent modern lifestyle.</p>
<p>The first generation Body Scan checked 40 biomarkers, while the new model has 60, and even the press materials need a bulleted list to talk about the new features. Topping the bill is the new Impedance Cardiography (ICG) which monitors your heart’s capacity to pump blood to the organs. Second, Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) uses a low level electrical current to check your body’s total water, letting the scale keep an eye on your cellular age, active cell mass and metabolic efficiency.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of this data will then be extruded through the company’s “clinically validated” AI model to offer more insights, such as your risk of hypertension and glycemic regulation. You’ll also be told, based on your vital statistics, your health trajectory, and given tips on how to improve your “healthspan.” In short, the company wants to further position this as a clinic in a box, steering you toward healthier choices as and when it can.</p>
<p>There’s one major hardware tweak from the first generation, as the retractable handle used for the ECG now contains the scale’s display. That, I’m sure, makes it easier to read if you’re squinting naked onto the scale after your morning shower. But I’m also concerned that it’s a single point of failure for the thin cable attaching the handle to the rest of the scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Withings hopes to get the Body Scan 2 cleared by the FDA in time for its planned launch in the second quarter of 2026. As for the price, expect to pay a pretty penny for the flagship gear, as it will set you back $599.95, €499.95 or £449.95, depending on your territory.</p>

Since Apple ditched the port for USB-C, the audio accessory became obsolete for newer handsets. At CES 2026, the company debuted a revised version of the mic, swapping the Lightning connection for USB-C, which also adds compatibility for Android users and a host of other devices. The best part is the updated MV88 is available now, and it’s priced at $159. </p>
<p>If you missed the 2015 version, the MV88 is a compact stereo condenser microphone that simply snaps onto a phone, tablet or one of your laptop’s ports. It provides a packable boost to any built-in mics on your devices, allowing you to capture better audio for voice and video clips. What’s more, it’s a simple, plug-and-play option that doesn’t require additional setup. And if you choose to employ Shure’s suite of apps, you’ll get access to things like presets, microphone gain control, a five-band EQ, limiter, compression and a high-pass filter. Plus, the company’s apps will give you a microphone level meter to keep tabs on your input. </p>

<p>With Auto Level Mode, the mic automatically adjusts gain in real time so that your clips aren’t too loud or too quiet. There’s also a Real-Time Denoiser that works to reduce background noise. The MV88 USB-C has four selectable polar patterns — stereo, mono cardioid, mono bi-directional and raw mid-side — and you can tilt the microphone so that it either points straight up or towards you. </p>
<p>I’ve been testing the new MV88 for a few days ahead of CES and I can confirm it’s a substantial boost over anything a device’s built-in microphone can offer. It’s also a nice alternative to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/shures-first-wireless-lapel-mic-can-connect-to-your-phone-without-a-receiver-221517242.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">popular lapel mics</a> you’ve likely seen creators and influencers use. Those need to be held close to the speaker’s mouth, so they don’t pic up ambient sound or multiple speakers well without moving them. The MV88 would the better choice for capturing clips of live music, the great outdoors or other places where you want some level of background noise.</p>

<p>Sound quality has been impressive thus far. After barely tweaking any settings, audio capture is warm, but also crisp and clear. That Real-Time Denoiser completely eliminated a noisy hotel room A/C unit during one of my testing sessions. This means the new MV88 will improve my sound if I need to do any voice or video interviews this week from my room. I’m also looking forward to seeing how well it does at some of the evening events and on the CES show floor. </p>
<p>To me, the best part about the MV88 is the quick and easy setup. You literally just snap it on your phone, or another device with a USB-C port, and after a few taps you’re ready to record. Shure also included a small case for the microphone, so it’s less likely to get damaged any time you just need to chuck it in your bag. </p>

The dust bag seals itself so all the bad stuff stays put before you throw it away. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_mattress_vac.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_mattress_vac.jpg" style="height:1485px;width:2640px;" alt="The Narwal mattress vac uses heat and UV light to clean your bed.

Not only will the bot vacuum around any obstacles it sees, it can let you know they’re there. It also has different modes, including the intriguing PetCare Mode, that not only focuses on “pet zones” (places your dog or cat hangs out),  it can also find your pet. Say you’re not home and don’t see Sparky lying on her usual spot on the couch. Just ask your Flow 2 to locate your dog and it goes off on a special mission, beaming video of your girl sleeping in a sun puddle. Then if you decide to talk, the vacuum will oblige, complete with video and a speaker that lets you talk to your fur baby. </p><p>Of course, the vacuum’s real job is cleaning stuff up and this one uses a track-mop design that keeps infusing the mop with (now hotter) water along with downward pressure to clean up messes. The automatic hot-air drying feature makes sure there’s not too much wetness left behind when its done. The auto-empty base now comes with an upgraded reusable dust bag and washable debris filter, so you throw less stuff away. The collection capacity is rated at 120 days, so you only have to empty the machine once every few months at most. </p><p>The vacuums should be available in Spring of this year.   </p><p></p><p></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_flow_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/narwal_flow_2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The new Narwal Flow 2 vac mop" data-uuid="d5ce006f-cada-4cb9-ab15-c57e4ad15720"/><figcaption>The new Narwal Flow 2 vac mop</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Narwal</div></figure><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Belkin just introduced the appropriately-named Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 at CES 2026. This is a high-end charging case specifically designed for Nintendo&#39;s latest console.</p>
<p>The 10,000mAh power bank delivers up to 30W of fast charging, which is a decent enough metric. I&#39;m more excited, however, about the bells and whistles. The Charging Case Pro boasts an LCD screen on the exterior, making it easy to keep track of remaining battery life. It also doubles as a tabletop stand, which is always nice. The built-in Switch 2 stand is better than what we got <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-10-nintendo-switch-adjustable-charging-stand.html">with the first Switch</a>, but it&#39;s still not the sturdiest thing in the world.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/49147660-db80-11f0-bfce-6674b26df60f" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/49147660-db80-11f0-bfce-6674b26df60f" style="height:1270px;width:1266px;" alt="A charging case." data-uuid="bd22bf8f-a092-3736-9d6e-4e4a488690e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Belkin</div></figure>
<p>It also includes a dedicated flap for game card storage and a hidden compartment for smart trackers. Take that, would-be Switch 2 thieves. Belkin promises this case has been made from premium materials and has been designed for &quot;long-term durability.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/23d7c9b0-e9cc-11f0-abee-4d0dd4c9f957" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/23d7c9b0-e9cc-11f0-abee-4d0dd4c9f957" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Belkin Charging Case Pro" data-uuid="c6356af0-bf4b-37f0-aab5-d7a730341473"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>At CES 2026, the company had a sample on display (though, bizarrely, no Switch 2 to protect it), so we saw some clever design choices, such as an oval cutout on the front of the case where the battery indicator (and USB-C port) peeks out. On the original, you had to lift out the battery out in order to charge it. The built-in tabletop stand appears solid and can be used both inside and outside the case. (&quot;I knew had should have brought my own Switch 2 along&quot; — Engadget&#39;s Mat Smith.)</p>
<p>The Charging Case Pro is available in off-white, sage and dark grey color options and is available right now and costs $100 — a bump up from the $70 original.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/00f921e0-e9cd-11f0-97fb-7c77aa9c8f25" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/00f921e0-e9cd-11f0-97fb-7c77aa9c8f25" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Belkin Charging Case Pro at CES 2026" data-uuid="6e20d5f3-77a5-3c57-9d2c-e6216e6ce6bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The company also introduced a number of other charging accessories at CES. The UltraCharge Pro Power Bank juices up two devices at once and also costs $100, with availability in February. The BoostCharge power bank is an extremely slim unit that easily slides into pockets. That one starts at $60, but isn&#39;t coming until later in the year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkin-charging-case-for-the-switch-2-ces-2026-screen-for-checking-battery-life-170029146.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Are you ready for CES 2026? While the show floor doesn&#39;t open until Tuesday, things are effectively kicking off this evening with the first big press event of the show. Samsung is taking the stage to set the agenda for the new year and share an overview of its latest and greatest advances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation. Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping press releases left and right, so we know at least some of what to expect in Vegas this year. Of course, we&#39;re holding out hope that we get to hear an update on the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html">Ballie robot</a> — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html">2025 release date</a>.</p>

<p>The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas tonight — Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET (7PM PT). There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung">Samsung Electronic&#39; official YouTube channel</a> (which we&#39;ve embedded below), <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">Samsung Newsroom</a> or via Samsung TV Plus.&nbsp;</p>

Tune in for real-time updates and commentary.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-samsung-at-ces-2026">What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026</h2>
<p>Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &quot;new AI-driven customer experiences,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look">said in a press release</a>. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &quot;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&quot;</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung has been following its &quot;Advent calendar&quot; approach to early CES announcements, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">new press releases</a> dropping nearly every day in late December and early January. So far, we know that — like competitors <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html">LG</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html">Hisense</a> — the company will be offering details on a line of <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">micro RGB TVs</a> (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-new-ai-connected-living-lineup-at-ces-2026">Bespoke AI</a>. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html">Music Studio 5 and 7</a>, at CES this year. Additionally, it&#39;ll debut its latest <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html">Freestyle+ portable projector</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html">Odyssey gaming monitor</a>. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen <em>and</em> has glasses-free 3D. It&#39;s likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that Samsung will share even more early CES announcements in the hours preceding its presentation. If that happens, we&#39;ll add them here!</p>

Baby FuFu is a portable fan for babies that attaches to strollers.</p><p>Baby FuFu is modeled on the company&#39;s smaller (but otherwise identical-looking) drink-cooling gadget, Nekojita FuFu. &quot;Baby FuFu grew out of Nekojita FuFu fans&#39; feedback that their children love not only cooling their food with it but also playing with it, pretending to fan their faces and blow-dry their hair,&quot; Yukai Engineering CEO Shunsuke Aoki said.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/unveiled5.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/unveiled5.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Baby FuFu, positioned on the stroller handle." data-uuid="88abd5a8-160a-4f54-8852-ba7e8255a721"/><figcaption>Baby FuFu, positioned on the stroller handle.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure><p>The company says the fan blades are concealed behind a slit plate that blocks even the tiniest fingers from entering. The cat-like fan’s &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;feet&quot; are designed to latch onto stroller handles. Parents can angle Baby FuFu to aim airflow at the child&#39;s face (or anywhere else). It has three airflow settings, adjustable with a single button.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s a good chance you spend more time talking to your phone&#39;s virtual assistant, or dictating text with your voice, instead of actually calling people these days. But, as convenient as voice input can be, you don&#39;t want to be the obnoxious person shouting commands to Siri or ChatGPT in a quiet library. And you probably won&#39;t have much luck dictating an email in a room with toddlers screaming and Peppa Pig blaring on the TV. (Ask me how I know.) </p><p> At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-big-january-conference-120000956.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the startup <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.subtle.co/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Subtle</a> is unveiling its solution to those issues: Voicebuds. While they look like a typical pair of wireless earbuds, they feature a custom AI model that lets you dictate text below the sound of a whisper. Additionally, they can also filter out noisy environments so that you don&#39;t have to shout for dictation and voice commands. The Voicebuds seem similar to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/this-ring-lets-you-whisper-to-your-phone-because-sometimes-we-need-to-use-our-inside-voices-002529204.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">WHSP ring we saw at CES 2024</a>, which let whisper to your phone, and they also compete with other AI earbuds like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ausounds.com/products/notebuds-one" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Notebuds One</a>.     </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VoicebudsInkBlack2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VoicebudsInkBlack2.jpg" style="height:1334px;width:2000px;" alt="Subtle Voicebuds." data-uuid="ce81d331-1ef5-4b89-8f28-56ebf1bcf769"/><figcaption>Subtle Voicebuds.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Subtle</div></figure><p>Subtle claims its Voicebuds deliver five times fewer transcription errors than the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">AirPods Pro 3</a> with OpenAI transcription. At $199, they&#39;re also priced competitively with Apple&#39;s best buds. As with many new hardware products, though, there&#39;s also an additional subscription for premium features on Subtle&#39;s app, including instant dictation and the ability to transcribe notes without looking at your phone. You&#39;ll get a year&#39;s worth of access to the Subtle iOS app (there&#39;s no Android support so far) when you buy the Voicebuds, but after that it&#39;s a $17 a month fee. Without the subscription, the Voicebuds still offer better overall transcription accuracy with its on-device machine learning model. </p><p>When I tried the Voicebuds at the absolutely raucous CES Unveiled show floor, it was able accurately dictate several sentences at my normal speaking voice. Subtle CEO Tyler Chen was able to replicate that experience across several demos. In a separate remote demonstration, he was also able to dictate several sentences while barely whispering in a quiet room.  (He was so quiet, I couldn&#39;t even hear what he was saying over video chat). </p><p>As you’d expect, you can use Voicebuds to take calls and listen to audio just like any other pair of headphones.  They also offer other modern features, like active noise cancellation and a multi-mic array. Still, I can&#39;t imagine a fledgling startup will be able to match the refined audio quality we&#39;ve seen from the AirPods Pro 3 and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Sony&#39;s latest buds</a>, or their well-honed ANC capabilities.</p><p>As someone who&#39;s practically attached to my AirPods Pros, primarily because they handle Siri voice commands so well, it would have to take a truly transformative product to replace them. Voicebuds won&#39;t support Apple&#39;s &quot;Hey, Siri&quot; command, since that involves having one of Apple&#39;s proprietary chips, though Chen says the company is integrating its own AI assistant. But if the Voicebud&#39;s transcription is as great as the company claims, they may eventually earn a coveted place in my pocket alongside Apple&#39;s buds. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-subtle-voicebuds-use-ai-to-transcribe-your-words-below-a-whisper-or-in-very-loud-spaces-like-the-ces-show-floor-000000019.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company will outline the full scope of its vision for AI implementations across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise applications. The presentation — which is the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/dr-lisa-su-chair-and-ceo-of-amd-to-keynote-ces-2026-on-how-ai-is-changing-the-world-302550208.html">lead keynote</a> for CES 2026 — will be led by CEO Dr. Lisa Su.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll tell you how to tune in to the livestream and what else you can expect to see.</p>

<p>Dr. Su will deliver a keynote speech from the Palazzo Ballroom at the Venetian on Monday, January 5 at 9:30PM ET (6:30PM PT). You can watch the event live on the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvBNWbFK2lY">CES YouTube channel</a> (we&#39;ve embedded the livestream below).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>While AMD says it&#39;s keeping its product details <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html">under wraps</a>, we can expect &quot;updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the &quot;advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.&quot; That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever">better single-threaded performance</a>. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding AI, AMD could further discuss its new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-will-preview-its-redstone-upscaling-tech-on-december-10-174507324.html">FSR Redstone</a> technology, which it previously previewed on December 10. AMD&#39;s upscaling tech aims to close the gap on NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS 4, which was announced during CES 2025.</p>
<p>Su&#39;s presentation caps off CES&#39;s press day, so she&#39;ll be taking the stage in the hours after rivals <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130028668.html">NVIDIA</a> and Intel present their chipmaking and AI plans to the world.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG has unveiled its humanoid robot that can handle household chores. After <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">teasing</a> the CLOiD last week, the company has offered its first look at the AI-powered robot it claims can fold laundry, unload the dishwasher, serve food and help out with other tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>The CLOiD has a surprisingly cute &quot;head unit&quot; that&#39;s equipped with a display, speakers, cameras and other sensors. &quot;Collectively, these elements allow the robot to communicate with humans through spoken language and &#39;facial expressions,&#39; learn the living environments and lifestyle patterns of its users and control connected home appliances based on its learnings,&quot; LG says in its <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4290a65d-014e-45bc-8214-f56182cc455e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;linkText=press+release&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYXzxCQ5c7xl0Oymtb0L6a_3C7pMaGWmp-IzJ0DwqpAI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fhome-appliance-and-air-solution%2Flg-electronics-presents-lg-cloid-home-robot-to-demonstrate-zero-labor-home-at-ces-2026%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LG Electronics;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lg.com/global/newsroom/news/home-appliance-and-air-solution/lg-electronics-presents-lg-cloid-home-robot-to-demonstrate-zero-labor-home-at-ces-2026/">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The robot also has two robotic arms — complete with shoulder, elbow and wrist joints — and hands with fingers that can move independently. The company didn&#39;t share images of the CLOiD&#39;s base, but it uses wheels and technology similar to what the appliance maker has used for robot vacuums. The company notes that its arms are able to pick up objects that are &quot;knee level&quot; and higher, so it won&#39;t be able to pick up things from the floor.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/%5B5%5D_LG_CLOiD.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/%5B5%5D_LG_CLOiD.jpg" style="height:1380px;width:2451px;" alt="The CLOiD robot unloading a dishwasher." data-uuid="d2989f88-d499-457d-9f30-74aaf331005b"><figcaption>The CLOiD robot unloading a dishwasher.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>LG says it will show off the robot completing common chores in a variety of scenarios, like starting laundry cycles and folding freshly washed clothes. The company also shared images of it taking a croissant out of the oven, unloading plates from a dishwasher and serving a plate of food. Another image shows it standing alongside a woman in the middle of a home workout, though it&#39;s not clear how the CLOiD is aiding with that task.</p><p>We&#39;ll get a closer look at the CLOiD and its laundry-folding abilities once the CES show floor opens later this week, so we should get a better idea of just how capable it is. It sounds like for now LG intends this to be more of a concept rather than a product it plans to actually sell. The company says that it will &quot;continue developing home robots with practical functions and forms for housework&quot; and also bring its robotics technology to more of its home appliances, like refrigerators with doors that can automatically open.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-reveals-its-laundry-folding-robot-at-ces-2026-215121021.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Sony&#39;s CES 2026 press conference is just a few days away, and this year comes with a twist: Rather than an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Sound odd? That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. But this year, we&#39;ll get to see an all-new concept model at the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@shmafeela">Afeela official YouTube channel</a>, which we&#39;ve embedded below.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-sony-afeela-at-ces">What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES</h2>
<p>The Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html">since CES 2020</a>, where it was originally announced as  the Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said a year ago that the EV &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html">feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era</a>,&quot; and that &quot;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&quot; Ouch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/">said in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>The company recently announced that the Afeela will be the first vehicle ever to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/">offer PlayStation Remote Play</a>, which lets players stream their PS4 or PS5 games from their consoles remotely while inside the car. That&#39;s no doubt built on the same <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-playstation-portal-is-still-flawed-but-ive-learned-to-love-it-as-a-new-dad-120000850.html">streaming improvements</a> that have been incorporated into the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-portal-in-2025-from-home-streaming-dud-to-cloud-streaming-star-130000144.html">PlayStation Portal</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what else is new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.</p>

<p>During CES 2025, NVIDIA spent much of its keynote touting its leading position in artificial intelligence. Still, the company managed to squeeze in a few notable hardware announcements, including <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-announced-at-its-ces-2025-keynote-174947827.html">its RTX 5000-series GPUs</a> and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidias-spark-desktop-ai-supercomputer-arrives-this-summer-200351998.html">Spark</a>).

<p>But if you won&#39;t be in Vegas for the action, don&#39;t worry. Here&#39;s how you can watch the livestream of the company&#39;s January 5 press conference, and what NVIDIA is expected to unveil at CES this year.</p>

<p>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on Monday, January 5 at 4PM ET via <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NVIDIA;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4a8ad1a0-9035-4f52-a4e0-783ee7c9700b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;linkText=NVIDIA%27s+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2V2ZW50cy9jZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YThhZDFhMC05MDM1LTRmNTItYTRlMC03ODNlZTdjOTcwMGIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm52aWRpYS5jb20vZW4tdXMvZXZlbnRzL2Nlcy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR26TWBottpAVLkSWGEW61EoLzbnApNs7qzQl5JGh6Ef&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fevents%2Fces%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/">NVIDIA&#39;s website</a> (and likely on YouTube as well). We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>NVIDIA&#39;s game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including  &quot;cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.&quot; It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we&#39;re unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.</p>
<p>NVIDIA arrives at CES as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world (a stunning $4.6 trillion at the time of this writing, albeit down from an <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-worth-much-german-economy-133045033.html">even higher valuation</a> earlier in 2025). And given that the health of the US and global economy seems <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html">increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers</a> — largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang&#39;s remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company&#39;s Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA&#39;s partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang&#39;s presentation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-with-jensen-huang-live-130028602.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years, LG has pushed its ultra-light Gram laptops as a way to stand out from the PC crowd, for better or worse. I was&#39;t a big fan of the flex-prone case in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-17-lg-gram-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">2017 Gram</a>, and we had similar concerns with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-lg-gram-17-review-price-specs-big-screen-thin-light.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">first 17-inch Gram in 2019</a>. But in fairness, it&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve reviewed one, and we found a lot to like in our preview of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-gram-pro-2-in-1-2025-hands-on-of-course-a-thin-and-light-laptop-gets-ai-at-ces-2025-023252332.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">last year&#39;s AI-equipped model</a>. Now LG is back with a major <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Gram Pro redesign at CES 2026</a>, which features a new aluminum/magnesium alloy it&#39;s dubbed &quot;Aerominum.&quot; And finally, it seems LG has found a balance between building a super-light notebook (the 16-inch Gram Pro weighs just 2.6 pounds), and crafting something that actually feels durable. </p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/cOPiUWxC" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Admittedly, the Gram Pro doesn&#39;t look particularly impressive at first glance. It has a large 16-inch 2.8K OLED screen, which certainly looks nice, but doesn&#39;t really stand out from the glut of other OLED laptops on market. It&#39;s also powered by Intel&#39;s new Panther Lake chips, and it supports dual NVMe SSDs. The magic happens when you pick it up: My brain had a hard time computing how such a large computer felt so light in my hands. And best of all, it didn&#39;t flex much when I tried to squeeze the case. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_Gram_Pro-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_Gram_Pro-3.jpg" style="height:1250px;width:2000px;" alt="LG Gram Pro 16 side ports." data-uuid="6c7d4486-0851-4c46-be33-eede0ad518f7"/><figcaption>LG Gram Pro 16 side ports.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>There&#39;s still a bit of give, to be clear, but it didn&#39;t feel as precariously bendy as earlier models. I wouldn&#39;t stress too much about throwing it into a messenger bag without additional protection. The more I handled the Gram Pro, the more I wished other PC makers strived for similar weight reduction. The Gram Pro weighs about as much as the 13-inch MacBook Air! That&#39;s certainly an impressive feat.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_Gram_Pro-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_Gram_Pro-2.jpg" style="height:1147px;width:2000px;" alt="The LG Gram Pro 16&#39;s disappointing keyboard." data-uuid="3cfea952-1a0e-45a8-b126-24bb15dfc818"/><figcaption>The LG Gram Pro 16&#39;s disappointing keyboard.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>I just wish LG spent as much time refining the Gram Pro&#39;s keyboard as its case design. There&#39;s barely any key travel, which made for an unresponsive and unsatisfying typing experience. I get it, LG probably doesn&#39;t have the available vertical height for much key movement, but there are other ways to make typing feel more dynamic. The Gram Pro&#39;s trackpad, meanwhile, is serviceable, but it also didn&#39;t feel as smooth and responsive as what we see from Apple&#39;s notebooks or Microsoft&#39;s Surface Laptop.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/KV2_1__gram_Pro_B_S_02.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/KV2_1__gram_Pro_B_S_02.jpg" style="height:566px;width:800px;" alt="LG Gram Pro 17" data-uuid="f671a945-688f-4a15-b7ee-f1794d3b77bf"/><figcaption>LG Gram Pro 17</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>In addition to the 16-inch Gram Pro, LG also debuted a 17-inch model with an Aerominum case, which is notable for being the lightest notebook at that size with an NVIDIA RTX GPU. Specifically, it&#39;s toting the RTX 5050, which should be enough to play most games at the laptop&#39;s native 2,880 by 1,800 resolution (or 1440p blown up a bit). Given the more powerful hardware, the Gram Pro 17 is heavier than the 16-inch model, but it still comes at a relatively light 3.8 pounds. I didn&#39;t get a chance to play any games on the laptop, unfortunately, but overall it looks like a decent option for someone who wants a large screen with a bit of horsepower.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lgs-aerominum-gram-pro-laptops-feel-impossibly-light-and-strong-200317743.html?src=rss]]></description>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense&#39;s presentation and how you can watch it live.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch">How to watch Hisense&#39;s presentation</h2>
<p>Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/ces-2026">its website</a>. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-names-sarah-larsen-as-cmo-to-guide-the-brand-s-continued-growth-and-innovation-leadershi">Larsen</a>, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/exclusive-hisense-is-betting-on-rgb-tvs-to-shake-up-the-industry-and-make-rivals-nervous">Tom&#39;s Guide</a>, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.</p>
<p>As for actual announcements, expect Hisense to split the difference between large appliances and consumer electronics. In an early <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-appliance-innovations-and-ai-powered-home-assistance-coming-to-ces-2026">press release</a>, the company is touting (what else) the enhanced AI smarts of its ConnectLife platform, stretching across everything from HVAC systems to kitchen gear to washer/dryers (&quot;... with the enhanced AI Laundry Agent, fabric types and soil levels are automatically identified...&quot;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">Samsung</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">LG</a> have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.</p>

<p>Lenovo is using the high-profile Sphere venue to share some of its tie-ins to the sports world, offering an exclusive look at how the company&#39;s technology has &quot;revolutionized F1,&quot; Yang <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7fedcbad-9aca-41b8-93db-45c9330ce965&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=said+in+a+press+release&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MubGVub3ZvLmNvbS9wcmVzc3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbGVub3ZvLWFubm91bmNlcy10ZWNod29ybGQtY2VzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2ZlZGNiYWQtOWFjYS00MWI4LTkzZGItNDVjOTMzMGNlOTY1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MubGVub3ZvLmNvbS9wcmVzc3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbGVub3ZvLWFubm91bmNlcy10ZWNod29ybGQtY2VzLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASIedKCznynpWoYW1Yom7rDfg7f8-uyByDlDjqmuzpi7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.lenovo.com%2Fpressroom%2Fpress-releases%2Flenovo-announces-techworld-ces%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-announces-techworld-ces/">said in a press release</a>. He&#39;ll also preview the plans for leveraging AI at this summer&#39;s FIFA World Cup, which takes place in the US.</p>
<p>After the event has wrapped up, pop singer Gwen Stefani will take the stage to perform.</p>
<p>As for real products, look for Lenovo to build on some of its successful launches from CES 2025. A year ago, we saw the portable <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ces-2025-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld-160001642.html">Lenovo Legion Go S –</a> the first third-party SteamOS handheld gaming device – as well as its &quot;stretchy&quot; laptop, the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable</a> that extends 2.7 inches taller with a touch of a button. To Lenovo&#39;s credit, both products were actually released and available for sale within months, unlike the vaporware that seems to comprise the bulk of many companies&#39; CES announcements.</p>
<p>Lastly, don&#39;t be surprised if we see some new Motorola smartphones, given that Lenovo is the parent company of the phone manufacturer. Maybe a new <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-is-blowing-out-the-razr-line-with-three-new-models-starting-at-just-700-160053171.html">Razr foldable</a>?

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Plaud is back with another conversation-recording AI wearable. This one, the NotePin S, is only a minor iteration on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/watch-out-theres-a-new-ai-pin-in-town-that-can-transcribe-all-your-conversations-153131281.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the original NotePin</a>. This model adds… a button.</p><p>The recessed recording button replaces the squeeze-to-record mechanism on the 2024 original. A single long press starts recording. It also adds a new &quot;press to highlight&quot; feature. The idea is to flag what&#39;s most important in a conversation, helping the AI learn what to emphasize in its summary.</p><p>Otherwise, you&#39;re getting the same package as in the first NotePin. The capsule-sized &quot;S&quot; model still has two microphones, weighs 0.6 ounces and has an advertised reliable recording range of 9.8 feet. (Students may want to keep that last point in mind before considering one for classes in lecture halls.) It includes hardware to set it up as a pin / lapel, lanyard, wristband or clip.</p><p>The NotePin S is available today for $179. You can order it from Plaud&#39;s website and Amazon. Just be sure to look out for your fellow humans and get their consent before recording them, okay?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>We&#39;re just hours away from the start of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html">CES 2026</a>, and with that comes <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html">Intel&#39;s launch event</a>. The chip giant is expected to provide more details on its AI PC initiative and the new processors powering it: The Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs (aka Panther Lake) are made using an 18A process — that&#39;s 18 <em>angstroms</em>, or just under 2nm — and designed for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-its-panther-lake-core-ultra-chips-130010879.html">high-end laptops and gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>For Intel, the stakes at CES are higher than ever. In the past 12 months, both <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/nvidia-throws-intel-a-5-billion-lifeline-to-build-pc-and-data-center-cpus-122030186.html">NVIDIA</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-government-is-taking-an-89-billion-stake-in-intel-205047795.html">US government</a> acquired ownership stakes in the company, helping nearly double the stock price by the end of the year. But that&#39;s still down over more than 20 percent since 2021, as rivals like TSMC, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA have taken the leadership mantle in chip fabrication and AI hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-intels-launch-event">How to watch Intel&#39;s launch event</h2>
<p>Senior VP of Intel&#39;s Client Computing Group Jim Johnson will kick off the launch event on Monday, January 5 at 6PM ET. A livestream will be available on the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@IntelNewsroom/featured">Intel Newsroom YouTube channel</a>, which we&#39;ll post here when it&#39;s live.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect from Intel at CES 2026</h2>
<p>As we noted above, Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be highlighting &quot;the next generation of Intel-powered PCs, edge solution, and the AI experiences enabled by the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors.&quot; We&#39;ll be keen to hear if the company can address the profitability concerns that have surrounded those next-gen chips since at least last summer, when <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intel-struggles-with-key-manufacturing-process-next-pc-chip-sources-say-2025-08-05/">published reports</a> indicated that yields were still under 50 percent. (In response, Intel <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intels-next-gen-manufacturing-process-is-reportedly-still-struggling-184146350.html">told Engadget</a> that it felt &quot;very good&quot; about its trajectory on Panther Lake, though it didn&#39;t hit the late 2025 release date it had envisioned at the time.)</p>
<p>Will we get any updates on that NVIDIA partnership? It&#39;s possible. But don&#39;t expect to hear anything about <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-could-return-to-using-intel-chips-in-2027">Intel possibly fabricating the chips</a> for that rumored new entry-level MacBook Air. If that comes to pass, the announcement will definitely be at a time and place of Apple&#39;s choosing.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-intel-ces-2026-launch-event-130040089.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Govee, which makes some of the more unique and interesting <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">smart lighting</a> products, has a new batch at CES 2026. That includes two ceiling lights (one of which simulates a skylight) and a floor lamp that supports trillions of colors.</p><p>Govee describes the new Ceiling Light Ultra as &quot;the industry&#39;s first ceiling light designed as a true creative canvas.&quot; It uses 616 individually controlled LEDs (the highest in its class, according to Govee) to provide that level of detail. Using the Govee app, you can design visuals for it &quot;with up to eight distinct layers of motion, color and shapes.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Celling_Light_Ultra_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Celling_Light_Ultra_2.jpg" style="height:2250px;width:4000px;" alt="Product marketing photo.

The new version of the scene creation chatbot lets other compatible lights (including the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/govees-new-desktop-display-is-reserved-for-pixel-art-230003228.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Gaming Pixel Light</a>) &quot;generate dynamic GIF animations.&quot;</p><p>If your ceiling lamp needs are as simple as “look like a skylight, please,” there&#39;s the Govee Ceiling Light with Blue Sky Effect. The company says it emulates natural skylights &quot;with high accuracy.&quot; (However, it&#39;s also less flexible than the Ultra, with far fewer individually controlled LEDs.) You can also use it as a more traditional white-light fixture, and Govee says it&#39;s good for spaces are large as 300 square feet.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/govee.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/govee.jpg" style="height:858px;width:1525px;" alt="Product lifestyle marketing image.

The sleek light&#39;s 16-bit RGBIC array allows it to reproduce over 281 trillion colors. Its white lighting capabilities range from 1000K to 10000K. It also supports a new DaySync system that can adjust lighting effects to match the time of day.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don&#39;t yet know precisely when any of the new lights will be available — or how much they&#39;ll cost.
