                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has introduced an app directory that&#39;s now available right inside ChatGPT, the company announced. &quot;Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take action like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck or search for an apartment,&quot; the company wrote in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/">blog post</a>. OpenAI also noted in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-apps-in-chatgpt">help document</a> that &quot;connector&quot; apps like Google Drive are now simply called &quot;apps.&quot;</p>
<p>The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) is divided into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and sites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox. To use an app, simply click on it, hit &quot;Connect&quot; then authorize the app to access ChatGPT. With that done, you can then start a chat related to that app. In the case of Dropbox, for instance, you&#39;ll be able to &quot;gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,&quot; according to the description. Once connected, any app can be accessed by doing an @ mention of it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A new addition that came along with the store is an Apple Music app that, like Spotify, helps users find music, create playlists and manage their libraries through a chat interface. Another is DoorDash, which lets you transform recipes, meal planning and staples into &quot;an actionable shopping cart.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with the app directory, OpenAI is now allowing developers to submit apps for review and publication in ChatGPT according to the company&#39;s app submission <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-developer-guidelines">guidelines.</a> It also published resources to help developers build such apps, including <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://developers.openai.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-chatgpt-app">best practices</a>, open-source example apps, an open-sourced UI library for chat-native interfaces and a step-by-step <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/quickstart/">quickstart guide</a>. That&#39;s on top of the software developer kit (SDK) that OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canva-and-other-apps-can-now-connect-to-chatgpt-194830116.html">introduced in October</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI noted that for now, developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to the native app or website — but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well. Privacy was also emphasized, with companies required to provide &quot;clear&quot; policies.</p>
<p>The new feature is a big part of Sam Altman&#39;s promises to make ChatGPT more versatile with the addition of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gpts-are-the-single-application-mini-chatgpt-models-that-anyone-can-create-203311858.html">custom &quot;GPT&quot; bots</a>. &quot;Over time, we want apps in ChatGPT to feel like a natural extension of the conversation, helping people move from ideas to action, while building a thriving ecosystem for developers,&quot; the company wrote.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-white-elephant-faqs">White elephant FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-white-elephant">What is white elephant?</h3> 
<p>A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-does-white-elephant-work">How does white elephant work?</h3> 
<p>A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-it-called-white-elephant">Why is it called white elephant?</h3> 
<p>The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.</p>

That&#39;s an all-time-low price and better than the price it was during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation.</p>

<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">the best AirPods</a> available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">Engadget&#39;s review</a> this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &quot;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&quot; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Ultrahuman Ring Air now has the capacity to track snoring and general respiratory health. This is thanks to proprietary technology called Respiratory Health PowerPlug, which is basically a suite of audio analysis tools along with some &quot;advanced biomarker tracking&quot; and AI tomfoolery.</p>
<p>All of this results in &quot;one of the most comprehensive consumer tools ever built for understanding nighttime respiratory stability.&quot; It details snoring sessions, of course, but also delivers a holistic and &quot;actionable sleep picture.&quot; The company says this &quot;reveals patterns, trends and changes in respiratory health over time.&quot;</p>

<p>To that end, it can also detect coughing and respiratory disturbances. This data is cross-referenced with movement patterns, sleep fragmentation patterns and resting heart rate to &quot;show exactly how breathing issues shape sleep quality.&quot; The company says this can be a good resource when experimenting with interventions, like switching to a new pillow or taping up the nose.</p>
<p>More health data is never a bad thing, but this information isn&#39;t free. Ultrahuman is charging $4 per month for access to the tool, though folks can pick up an annual subscription for $40.</p>

This comes after a recently published <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-shows-that-instacart-was-charging-different-amounts-for-the-same-items-165108224.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">pricing experiment study</a> showed that the online grocery delivery app gave different users different prices for the same items from the same store location at the exact same time. Some of the testers saw prices up to 23 percent higher than what the other testers saw, though the average difference for the same list of items was around 7 percent. Those higher prices could cost customers over $1,000 more in expenses for the year. </p><p>“The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,” the FTC told Reuters in a statement. “But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart’s alleged pricing practices.”</p><p>When the study came out, Instacart told Engadget that the pricing variances were caused by some of its retail partners doing “limited, short-term and randomized tests” to better understand consumers. Those randomized pricing tests were enabled by Instacart’s AI pricing tool called Eversight developed by a company it purchased in 2022.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year Sony <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html">sued Tencent</a> for copyright infringement over its <em>Light of Motiram</em> game, calling it a &quot;slavish clone&quot; of Horizon Zero Dawn. Then, earlier this month, Tencent agreed to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html">stop promoting</a> and publicly testing the game. Now, the two companies have reached a &quot;confidential settlement&quot; and the case has been dismissed, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court documents</a> seen by <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a>. <em>Light of Motiram</em> has also disappeared from Steam and Epic&#39;s game stores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,&quot; Tencent&#39;s spokesperson told <em>The Verge.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Sony first filed its lawsuit in July 2025, it said that Tencent&#39;s game appeared to copy aspects of not just <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, but other franchise games including <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-horizon-adventures-might-be-sonys-most-important-game-of-the-year-160026354.html"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a>. That included the post-apocalyptic setting with humans and machines coexisting, the visual appearance of characters and even the marketing materials — something Engadget certainly noticed when Tencent first announced the game.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s AirPods have become the default choice for many people, whether you want simple wireless earbuds that work without fuss or premium options with features like noise cancellation and spatial audio. The lineup has grown over the years, so there is now a model for almost every type of listener. Some pairs are built for all-day comfort, others focus on isolation and richer sound, and Apple’s over-ear option offers a more immersive experience for movies and music.<br><br>If you spend most of your time on an iPhone or iPad, all AirPods share one big advantage: they connect instantly and switch between Apple devices seamlessly. With new models always on the horizon and longtime favorites still holding up well, we rounded up the best AirPods to help you decide which ones match your listening style.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-you-need-to-know-about-airpods">What you need to know about AirPods</h2> 
<p>When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation.</p> 
<p>If you don’t think any of the AirPods options are right for you, consult our recommendations on the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html">best wireless headphones</a> for some alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-4-with-anc">AirPods 4 with ANC</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> represent the first time active noise cancellation has been available on the open-wear, “regular” AirPods. Design-wise, they’re the same as the non-ANC model, so the difference is entirely in the features list. This more expensive version adds Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness and a wireless charging case. The ANC isn’t as powerful as the AirPods Pro 2, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 doesn’t completely seal off your ears. The noise-canceling performance is definitely useful though, working best with constant, low-frequency annoyances like fans and white noise machines. Lastly, you won’t get access to Apple’s hearing test and hearing aid features, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 with ANC doesn’t seal off your ears, which would affect accuracy and effectiveness.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0">who Pepe Silvia is</a> when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney's streaming prices chart</a>, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-do-wireless-charging-pads-work-with-any-phone-or-device">Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?</h2> 
<p>The short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that’s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>When it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you’re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you’re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you’ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up.</p> 
<p>Those with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don’t support Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B09BZ17JM7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=92afccad-7a6d-4b3e-b701-91c6301fd52f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=magnetic+adapter+for+pretty+cheap&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdEX_d0-vXtE7h5w9QtUo9s6V3nZnhWggLO4XCvtu56x&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FESR-HaloLock-Universal-Conversion-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09BZ17JM7%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-Universal-Conversion-Compatible/dp/B09BZ17JM7/">magnetic adapter for pretty cheap</a> that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers.

<p>Even without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.</p> 
<p>If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones.</p> 
<p>A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.</p> 
<p>For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-charging-speed-and-performance">Wireless charging speed and performance</h2> 
<p>It’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.</p> 
<p>Today, most wireless chargers come in at 15W for phones. The latest Qi2 standard can get you up to 25W of power with a compatible smartphone. These speeds are improving bit by bit, but they&#39;re still not quite as fast as wired charging. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough.</p> 
<p>If you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is teaming up with Dolby for a new collection of speakers that the companies are unveiling ahead of CES 2026. The LG Sound Suite features a modular lineup the H7 soundbar, M7 and M5 wireless surround speakers and the W7 subwoofer. The speakers can be combined in more than two dozen different configurations, from a pair to a full 13.1.7 channel surround sound home theater setup.</p><p>The main pitch of the LG Sound Suite is its application of Dolby Atmos FlexConnect. This is the audio brand&#39;s tech for optimizing sound from wherever wireless speakers are placed. It&#39;s meant to deliver optimal sound even from unusual locations, even when you&#39;re limited by outlet locations, furniture placement or other quirks of a room&#39;s layout. The collaboration with LG brings FlexConnect to a soundbar for the first time. When the H7 soundbar is used as the lead device, the suite will bring Dolby Atmos FlexConnect audio to any television. In a future software update, LG will also bring support for Dolby Atmos FlexConnect directly to some of its premium TVs, including select 2025 models.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A report from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-china-built-its-manhattan-project-rival-west-ai-chips-2025-12-17/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Reuters</em></a> claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. <em>Reuters</em> states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.&nbsp;</p><p>EUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIiqVrKDtLc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>If confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. &quot;The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,&quot; a source told <em>Reuters</em>. &quot;China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-reportedly-has-a-prototype-euv-machine-built-by-ex-asml-employees-235833756.html?src=rss]]></description>

Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.</p><p>Under the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mattnavarra/post/DSXCACNirEt?xmt=AQF0RFIeIUKauwYgaXm8z0zs0jD3qmZqDZnvscsBxLvu0g" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">shared by</a> social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that &quot;certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/587306041_17932047504117490_7939502344875913795_n_%281%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/587306041_17932047504117490_7939502344875913795_n_%281%29.jpg" style="height:1372px;width:1170px;" alt="Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test." data-uuid="360a7da6-7fb6-4f06-a787-bb206515c17e"><figcaption>Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using &quot;professional mode&quot; on Facebook. Publishers aren&#39;t affected for now. &quot;This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>While Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it&#39;s a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/meta-verified-creators" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">starts at</a> $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular. </p><p><strong><em>Have a tip for Karissa?

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Space is full of unsolved mysteries, and a team using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have recently turned up a doozy. &quot;I remember after we got the data down, our collective reaction was &#39;What the heck is this?&#39; It&#39;s extremely different from what we expected,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-observes-exoplanet-whose-composition-defies-explanation/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">said</a> Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington, a co-author on the study. </p><p>The researchers found an exoplanet dubbed PSR J2322-2650b that orbits a small, dense star emitting electromagnetic radiation known as a pulsar. They are an example of a black widow system, where a rapidly spinning pulsar is paired with a smaller astronomical body. A black widow duo isn’t unusual, but this pair has sparked questions about how the exoplanet originally formed. </p><p>The exoplanet&#39;s proximity to the pulsar and its intense gravitational pull have distorted it into an oblong lemon shape. More unusually, PSR J2322-2650b also has a unique atmosphere comprised mostly of helium and carbon. &quot;Instead of finding the normal molecules we expect to see on an exoplanet — like water, methane, and carbon dioxide — we saw molecular carbon,&quot; principal investigator Michael Zhang of University of Chicago said.&nbsp;Given its strange atmosphere, the team isn&#39;t certain how the exoplanet formed. &quot;It&#39;s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism,&quot; Zhang said. For now, we’ll chalk this up as another mystery of the universe.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-find-mysterious-lemon-shaped-exoplanet-with-nasas-webb-telescope-223722244.html?src=rss]]></description>

He was nominated to the post earlier this year. But days before he was scheduled for a confirmation vote, President Donald Trump <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trump-makes-a-last-minute-backtrack-on-his-pick-to-lead-nasa-153253836.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">withdrew his nomination</a>.</p><p>The reversal reportedly came after the president was told that Isaacman had donated to prominent Democrats. (Trump’s description of his decision, as based on a &quot;thorough review of prior associations,&quot; seemed to lend weight to that.) However, that was also around the time the Trump-Musk feud was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-leaves-doge-amid-tanking-tesla-sales-153859407.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">about to boil over</a>.

(That makes him something of an aberration among <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5274744/rfk-confirmation-vaccines-health-secretary" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Trump appointees in scientific fields</a>.) &quot;I am optimistic that Mr. Isaacman will bring a steady hand and clear vision to NASA,&quot; Sen. Marie Cantwell (D-WA) told <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>The new administrator has traveled to space twice on private missions. In a document published in May, Isaacman shared his three objectives for NASA. These included human missions to the Moon, Mars and deep space; helping the organization do more with a constrained budget; and cost-cutting through industry and academic partnerships.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html?src=rss]]></description>

The issue lies, per YouTube, with how Billboard weighs on-demand streams in its rankings: The publication weighs streams from paid music streaming services over ad-supported streams, and YouTube just so happens to run an ad-supported streaming service.</p><p>Much like getting a book on <em>The New York Times</em> Bestseller list, landing a spot on the Billboard charts doesn&#39;t carry quite the same importance that it once did. When the majority of the media people consume is digital and on-demand, sales numbers aren&#39;t a guaranteed indicator of success or popularity. That&#39;s part of the reason why Billboard started <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/billboard-hot-100-to-include-digital-streams-1050326/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">including digital streams</a> in its calculations way back in 2007, and why it announced plans to adjust how it weighs on-demand streaming just yesterday.</p><p>On Tuesday, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Billboard announced</a> that it would add more weight to streaming to &quot;better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.&quot; Billboard currently counts an &quot;album consumption unit&quot; as an album sale, which either breaks down to &quot;3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams.&quot; In the new ranking scheme that will go into effect in January 2026, &quot;each album consumption unit will now equal 2,500 ad-supported or 1,000 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The change means that it will take 33.3 percent fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20 percent fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit,&quot; Billboard says. Put another way, things are moving in YouTube’s favor, just apparently not as quickly as the company wants.</p><p>YouTube characterizes pulling its data from Billboard as fighting for fairness and equality, but it&#39;s equally connected to the platform’s demonstration of its own power. It already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/youtube-paid-out-8b-to-the-music-industry-in-12-months/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">funnels billions of dollars</a> to artists and labels from the money it makes on ads and subscriptions, but it clearly also wants the power to mint new chart-topping stars. “We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube says in its announcement. “Until then, if you&#39;re curious about what music is making waves on YouTube, you can visit our charts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://charts.youtube.com/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">here</a>.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/billboards-charts-are-increasingly-weighted-towards-on-demand-streaming-but-not-enough-for-youtube-220238291.html?src=rss]]></description>

Although we strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.</p>
<p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. For the holiday season, plenty of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have end-of-year deals live that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.</p>

This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

This &quot;reimagined FIFA football simulation game&quot; will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, and be available to Netflix subscribers next year, right in time for FIFA World Cup 2026.</p><p>EA and FIFA maintained a nearly 30 year partnership creating soccer games before they parted ways in 2022. EA continued its soccer series afterward as EA FC, but despite being in talks with &quot;leading game publishers, media companies and investors&quot; about &quot;a major new FIFA simulation football game title for 2024,&quot; a FIFA-backed competitor has yet to materialize. Instead, FIFA has mostly supported arcade soccer games in the last few years, like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://inside.fifa.com/organisation/media-releases/mythical-games-and-fifa-team-up-to-bring-new-football-arcade-game-fifa-rivals" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>FIFA Rivals</em></a> from Mythical Games and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKWU52Et1ww" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>FIFA Heroes</em></a> from ENVER.</p><p>While the game Delphi Interactive is working on is pitched as a &quot;simulation game,&quot; based on what little detail appears in Netflix&#39;s announcement, it doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s targeting hardcore soccer fans in the same way EA&#39;s games do. Instead, this new FIFA title is designed to be &quot;a game that anyone, anywhere, can pick up and instantly feel the magic of football,&quot; according to Delphi Interactive CEO Caspar Daugaard. The game will also be designed to use a smartphone as a controller, possibly limiting how demanding or complicated gameplay can actually be.</p><p>This new FIFA game will be Delphi Interactive&#39;s second project as a studio after working on IO Interactive&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>007 First Light</em></a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to convenience, it’s hard to beat Amazon. And that rationale isn’t limited to consumers: Many local districts shopping for supplies with public funds apply the same logic. But the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ILSR-AmazonProcurementReport.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">published a study</a> earlier this month (via <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://prospect.org/2025/12/17/amazon-conning-school-districts-out-of-millions/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>The American Prospect</em></a>) that illustrates the cost of that bargain. It suggests that Amazon’s “dynamic pricing” has led many schools and other localities to overpay for supplies.</p><p>Public schools and local governments have historically bought supplies by soliciting competitive bids from local suppliers. Those vendors then respond with fixed price lists, delivery timelines and other terms. This competition — all out in the open, part of the public record — encourages low prices and transparency.</p><p>On the surface, ordering from Amazon <em>appears</em> to offer competition, too. After all, the platform includes third-party vendors fighting for your dollars. But turning taxpayer funds over to Amazon’s algorithms isn’t quite that simple. That’s because the platform’s “dynamic pricing” (algorithmically driven real-time changes) is inherently opaque.</p><p>According to the report, Amazon’s contracts with public entities don’t include fixed price lists. Instead, they include language built around swings. “This contract has a dynamic pricing structure in which the price for items listed on the online digital marketplace is driven by the market,” Amazon’s contract with Utah reads. “This contract will not need to be amended when prices fluctuate.”</p><p>Below are some examples of wild price discrepancies for these districts. All of ILSR’s examples are from localities buying supplies from Amazon Business with public funds in 2023.</p><ul><li><p>A City of Boulder, CO employee ordered a 12-pack of Sharpie markers from Amazon Business for $8.99. On the same day, a Denver Public Schools worker ordered the same markers for $28.63.</p></li><li><p>Amazon charged Clark County, WA, $146,000 for 610 computer monitors. On another day, that same order would have cost $24,000 less.</p></li><li><p>Pittsburgh Schools bought two cases of Kleenex for $57.99 each. On the same day, Denver Schools paid $36.91 for a single case.</p></li><li><p>On a single August day, Denver Schools placed two separate orders for bulk cases of dry-erase markers. One cost $114.52. The other was $149.07.</p></li><li><p>In March 2023, Denver Schools paid $15.39 for a Swingline stapler (sold by Amazon). A few days later, the same school system paid $61.87 for the same product (sold by a third-party seller).</p></li></ul><p>Even in that last example, ILSR says Amazon’s algorithms are the culprit. “It might be tempting to blame the seller for putting a $62 price tag on a stapler or the employee for not noticing the cost,” the nonprofit argues. “But that overlooks Amazon’s pivotal role in the transaction — and the profit it makes. Amazon’s algorithms steer shoppers’ attention, selecting featured products and organizing search results. The platform routinely prompts users to ‘buy it again,’ even when the price has jumped. For busy public school employees, it’s all too easy to simply click the buy button, under the assumption that Amazon is surfacing the best option.”</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/d51f6860-e4df-11ef-9fbd-65a89c2ab524" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/d51f6860-e4df-11ef-9fbd-65a89c2ab524" style="height:3885px;width:5827px;" alt="LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In total, the jurisdictions in the study spent $3 million on those items. But based on the lowest prices Amazon charged during that period, they would have paid only $2.5 million. Across those same items, one school district could have saved 17 percent (about $1 million) if it consistently received Amazon’s lowest prices.</p><p>What would fair market value have been for those items? Well, it’s hard to say because the algorithms are steering pricing silently in the background. A more thorough study that included the same items, bought exclusively through the traditional procurement method, would tell us much more. And recent history has taught us that trusting Big Tech’s algorithms to serve the public good (rather than its own bottom line) is a fool’s errand.</p><p>In at least some cases, the practice routes public funds away from local vendors and toward overseas ones — and, of course, Amazon itself. In Berkeley County, WV, the school district spent $1.3 million on Amazon Business in 2023. What portion went to sellers in the state? A measly $142.</p><p>On top of all of that, the practice has snuffed out many of the smaller vendors that traditionally competed for these contracts. “The disappearance of these small and mid-sized businesses weakens local economies and tax bases,” the report concludes. “And it leaves governments increasingly dependent on Amazon, paving the way for the kind of monopoly control that ensures higher prices, poorer service, and less innovation.”</p><p>In a statement sent to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/us-schools-amazon-algorithmic-pricing" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Amazon disputed the study’s conclusions. “Pricing research is notoriously difficult to conduct accurately and typically lacks reliable methodology, including cherry-picked product selections, mismatched product comparisons and comparing in-stock items with products out-of-stock at competitors,”</p><p>ILSR’s report drew in spending data from 128 local governments (including cities, counties and school districts) and 122 state agencies. It also gathered contract documents and interviewed public officials, procurement experts and vendors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-links-amazons-algorithmic-pricing-with-erratic-inflated-costs-for-school-districts-202047988.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Meta announced that it was opening up its VR operating system to other headset makers, starting with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-opens-quest-os-to-third-parties-including-asus-and-lenovo-163127396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ASUS and Lenovo</a>. Now, it seems that Meta is pumping the brakes on the effort and those third-party Horizon OS headsets might never actually launch.</p><p>The company has &quot;paused&quot; the program,  <em>Road to VR  </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reported</a>. Meta confirmed the move in a statement to Engadget, saying that it&#39;s instead focusing on &quot;building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market.&quot; ASUS and Lenovo didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment. Both companies have said little about the headsets since they were first announced in 2024. ASUS&#39; was going to be a &quot;performance gaming&quot; headset under its Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand, while Lenovo&#39;s was intended to be  a mixed reality device focused on &quot;productivity, learning and entertainment&quot; experiences&nbsp;</p><p>The shift isn&#39;t entirely surprising. Meta Connect was very light on virtual reality news this year as smart glasses have become a central focus for the company. Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/meta-s-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-for-metaverse-efforts" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reported</a> that Meta was planning significant cuts to the teams working on virtual reality and Horizon Worlds. The company said at the time it was &quot;shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.&quot;</p><p>Still, Meta is seemingly leaving the door open for third-party VR headsets in the future. &quot;We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for 3rd-party device partnerships as the category evolves,&quot; the company said.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, this latest release may just take the budget-friendly cake. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.behringer.com/behringer/product?modelCode=0722-ABS">just introduced the UB-1 Micro</a>, previously called the Spirit, a portable analog synth inspired by the Oberheim Matrix line that costs just $49.</p>
<p>Despite the price tag, this thing still manages to sound extremely beefy. It features a pair of digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) based on the Oberheim Matrix 6 analog chip. The monophonic/duophonic synth boasts two LFOs to control filters and tuning and an arpeggiator with three patterns and a hold function.</p>

To that end, it can do USB/MIDI.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The entertainment industry’s most well-known awards show is heading to streaming.

The new deal means the awards show is abandoning its long-time partnership with ABC (owned by frequent Oscars heavyweight, The Walt Disney Company), though the Oscars will continue to air on the network through its 100th anniversary in 2028.</p><p>The Academy Awards will be joined by other Academy events and programming on the Oscars YouTube channel, including “the Governors Awards,&nbsp;the Oscars Nominations Announcement, the Oscars Nominees Luncheon, the Student Academy Awards, the Scientific and Technical Awards, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, film education programs, podcasts, and more,” AMPAS says.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The creators of the Hitman series have honed their style of- open-ended and spectacle-driven sandboxes across several games, and now they&#39;re taking their signature immersive gameplay to the world of James Bond. With 0<em>07 First Light</em>, developer IO Interactive is crafting an origin story for the globetrotting British spy, showing how he undertook daring missions at the start of his career to eventually become the world&#39;s most infamous agent.</p><p>Before the reveal at The Game Awards of <em>007 First Light</em>&#39;s newest villain, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igTh9ud5Liw" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">played by Lenny Kravitz</a>, we had an early look at the latest bits of plot for James Bond&#39;s origin story as a superspy. We also spoke with cinematic and narrative director Martin Emborg about the main inspirations for the game, how Bond&#39;s origin taps into decades of lore, and why a good spy story is timeless.</p><p>&quot;What I think is kind of baked into doing an origin story for a character like James Bond, is that everyone knows the character and who he&#39;s going to become,&quot; Emborg said. &quot;But how does he become this character? I think that&#39;s an exciting challenge from a storytelling perspective.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt=" " data-uuid="9bb349b3-88eb-4dd4-9d47-b47218aef3b6"><figcaption>IO Interactive&#39;s James Bond is young and inexperienced.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>While some Bond films and novels have touched upon the early years of the iconic character, <em>007 First Light</em> will be the first attempt at an actual, modernized origin story. As a twenty-something new MI6 recruit, this James Bond, portrayed by Patrick Gibson, is inexperienced and brash, which can result in some operations going off the rails. He still possesses a certain cunning, and near-supernatural levels of charisma and resourcefulness. This presents a solid archetype for the game’s open-ended missions where players will explore tightly designed worlds with a multitude of tasks and objectives to handle – however the players see fit.</p><p>While IO Interactive&#39;s Hitman series taps into the spy experience, what really separates James Bond from Agent 47 is that he&#39;s a far more social character. The social element will play a big part in how players can find ways to distract, or even outright bluff through charisma to sneak into areas.. Emborg explained that James Bond&#39;s resourcefulness also makes him a compelling character for a video game, especially one that is all about player agency.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt=" " data-uuid="3ddfd955-d150-4ea8-88b4-e1bcb6486995"><figcaption>007 First Light will take players to several locations, including Slovakia and what appears to be Vietnam.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>&quot;Bond is a competent character,” Emborg said. “We want to give the player the opportunities to have that agency to say, &#39;Oh, I&#39;m gonna talk to that guy,&#39; or, &#39;I&#39;m gonna go and punch that guy,’ or, ‘I can probably crawl up into a tight space to sneak in.&#39; Having that sense of agency is pivotal if you want to deliver a full Bond experience. Obviously, the social aspect of that is important; to embed yourself and infiltrate socially is a big part of that Bond experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Emborg said the rhythm of a James Bond game is different from a Hitman title, even though espionage, infiltration and subterfuge are at the core of both.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We have a lot of experience with that from obviously making Hitman, but there are just many more gears to Bond,” he said. “Of course, the shape of this game is different. We have sandbox locations where you make the open-ended decisions, but we also have other levels where it is a chase or a set-piece encounter, and then it opens up again. So we kind of coined the term, <em>having a game that breathes</em>. It&#39;s a very different way of playing this type of game that we usually do, so we&#39;ve definitely bolstered our toolbox for this game.&quot;</p><p>In many ways, <em>007 First Light</em> is a story that can only be told in an interactive format. The new game will pull from numerous novels and films for its plot, and it also features a large cast of familiar characters seen throughout the franchise – such as MI6 assistant Moneypenny (performed by Kiera Lester), gadget guru and quartermaster Q (played by Alastair Mackenzie), and team leader M (Priyanga Burford).&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jom-jxUEqJg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>But like any singular Bond story, <em>First Light</em> features its own set of original characters. In addition to James Bond&#39;s MI6 mentor John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a new core villain, black-market smuggler and warlord Bawma, will be played by Lenny Kravitz. It&#39;s a familiar setup for a Bond experience for sure, but within the context of a video game – one made by IO Interactive – it really taps looks to tap into the Bond fantasy more than other games have.&nbsp;</p><p>From the gameplay demos and trailers we&#39;ve seen, IO Interactive looks to be channeling the style and lore from decades of Bond with its modernized reboot of the character. From deep cuts to <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> – one of the great and underrated Bond movies – and <em>You Only Live Twice</em>, <em>007 First Light</em> is keeping a keen eye on paying tribute to what came before.</p><p>&quot;At the very beginning, it was very much like a maelstrom of [ideas], then suddenly something emerges, and you build up a story around it,&quot; Emborg said. He continued, “I love doing this stuff and with great reverence for the material. It&#39;s a privilege to work in this universe. James Bond is one of the few IPs that still hasn&#39;t been overdone, in my view. We have a space to come in with a fresh take, and he&#39;s a character who&#39;s seen a lot of versions over the years.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_1.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt=" " data-uuid="64cfa0ee-db10-4b22-b01d-f6a58c0466d9"><figcaption>Confirmed MI6 gadgets include the &quot;Q-Watch.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>So far, <em>007 First Light</em> has the makings of not only the biggest Bond game but also the most true-to-life simulation of being a superspy. While previous Bond games like <em>Goldeneye </em>and <em>Everything or Nothing</em> are well-loved classics, they embody traditional video game shooting spectacle. <em>007 First Light</em> is looking to lean into the immersive element of the Hitman games in its adaptation of James Bond, finally giving players the opportunities to explore the social aspects of spy work on a grand scale.&nbsp;</p><p><em>007 First Light</em> will arrive on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Monarch Money was the runner-up in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">guide</a> to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way.</p> 
<p>All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi.

It&#39;s extremely easy to ignore an app notification while in a food coma on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;Removing the tipping option is to keep workers in poverty and make them depend on taking more orders,&quot; said Ligia Guallpa, co-founder of Workers Justice Project.</p>
<p>Food delivery in the city is still booming. New Yorkers spent more than $265 million on restaurant deliveries in the first half of 2025, which is up from $183 million during the same period in 2022. Current estimates suggest that there are around 80,000 delivery workers in NYC.</p>
<p>This particular law became a small part of the city&#39;s recent mayoral campaign. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oe1vnlkzkygCRnW_31ft2fjnEITEWXvN/view"><ins>said during the campaign</ins></a> that he supported giving customers the option to tip at checkout. DoorDash donated $1 million to his rival, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-and-doordash-challenge-nyc-law-that-encourages-tipping-163315375.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a month after the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">debut of Gemini 3 Pro</a> in November, Google has begun rolling out the more efficient Flash version of its latest AI model. According to the company, the new system offers similar &quot;pro-grade&quot; reasoning performance as its flagship model at a fraction of the cost, making it ideal for everyday use.&nbsp;</p><p>In benchmarks, the new system performed significantly better than Google&#39;s previous generation models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro. More notably, in Google’s testing it managed to trade blows with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">GPT-5.2</a>, the model OpenAI rushed out to counter Gemini 3 Pro.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/gemini-3-flash_final_benchmark-table_light_25-12-17_%282%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/gemini-3-flash_final_benchmark-table_light_25-12-17_%282%29.gif" style="height:1408px;width:1210px;" alt="A table comparing Gemini 3 Flash&#39;s performance across a variety of AI benchmarks.

In a handful of other benchmarks, Google&#39;s more efficient system even managed to outperform OpenAI&#39;s latest. For instance, in MMMU-Pro, a benchmark designed to test a model&#39;s multimodal understanding and reasoning, it edged out GPT-5.2 with a result of 81.2 percent compared to 79.5 percent. Of course, benchmarks only tell a partial story; we&#39;ll have to see what people think once both systems are broadly available. Still, the fact Gemini 3 Flash is even close to GPT-5.2, and the &quot;Extra High&quot; reasoning mode at that, is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-house-of-cards-seems-primed-to-collapse-170000900.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">worrying sign for OpenAI</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with Gemini 3 Pro, Google is rolling out the new model to both the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash-gemini-app/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Gemini App</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-ai-mode-update-gemini-3-flash" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI Mode in Search</a> where it will be the default model for both services. &quot;That means all of our Gemini users globally will get access to the Gemini 3 experience at no cost, giving their everyday tasks a major upgrade,&quot; Google explains. While on the subject of AI Mode, it&#39;s now possible to access <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Nano Banana Pro</a>, Google&#39;s latest image generator, directly from the chatbot. Provided you live in the US, select &quot;Thinking with 3 Pro,&quot; followed by &quot;Create Images Pro&quot; from the model picker. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-gemini-3-flash-model-outperforms-gpt-52-in-some-benchmarks-160000000.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know what you're thinking, didn't OnePlus release a new phone just last month? It did. A little over five weeks after the announcement of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">OP15</a>, the company is back with the OnePlus 15R, a more affordable version of its new flagship that starts at $700 (or $200 less than its sibling). Off the top, this will be a shorter review because most of what I said about the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OnePlus 15</a> also applies to the OP15R. It's a great phone that asks you to make one pretty significant compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the OnePlus 15, the 15R looks like the OnePlus 13s and 13T, a pair of smaller, 6.32-inch phones the company released in India and China this past spring. I said the design of the OP15 was boring and derivative of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The 15R has done nothing to change that opinion. With one fewer camera, the OP15R doesn't look much different from the iPhone 12 I've been hanging on to since 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I'm more fond of the 15R's mint breeze color (the phone is also available in charcoal black) than the sand storm shade of my OP15. We're big fans of minty phones here at Engadget, and OnePlus has gone with a particularly pleasing hue of the color with its new phone. With the redesign, OnePlus has also improved the phone's waterproofing, bringing it in line with the OP15. The new handset is IP69K-certified against moisture and dust, meaning it can withstand heated water shot at it at pressure. Like the OP15, the 15R trades OnePlus' old Alert Slider for a new Plus Key. It functions like the iPhone's Action button, allowing you to add a shortcut for a favorite feature. For example, you can configure it to open the camera app or act as a do not disturb toggle, among a few other options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One departure from the OP15 is that the 15R has a larger 6.83-inch display, making it slightly taller than its sibling. OnePlus is marketing this as one reason buyers might pick the 15R over the OP15, but holding the phones side by side, there's not much difference between the two. They're both big, and you'll either like that or won't.</p>
<p>On top of being big, the 15R's screen can refresh at a fast 165Hz in games. The two displays are also comparable in terms of resolution and brightness; both can push 1,800 nits of brightness. One difference I noticed is the OnePlus 15 has a warmer panel, even when the two phones are set to the same colorspace. I've reached out to OnePlus to find what might be causing the disparity, but for now it may be due to a quality control issue or oversight in the company's software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing, OnePlus has upgraded the 15R to add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor beneath the screen. This is placed in a nice spot toward the bottom third of the display, and it's fast and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OnePlus 15R is the first phone in North America to arrive with Qualcomm's latest <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-snapdragon-8-gen-5-is-a-cut-down-version-of-qualcomms-flagship-elite-chipset-063050786.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset</a>. Not to be confused with the Snapdragon Gen 5 Elite in the OP15, this new chipset is similar to Qualcomm's flagship system-on-a-chip but has a weaker CPU and GPU. This is reflected in benchmarks like Geekbench 6 where the OP15 handily outperforms the OP15R. It's not even close, either, with the OP15 delivering standout single- and multi-core scores of 3,773 and 11,293, while the 15R put up more modest results of 2,857 and 9,512.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that perspective, you're losing a fair amount of performance, but real-world use tells a different story. Outside of the handful of games such as <em>Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG</em> that support the OP15 and 15R's 165Hz displays, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 offers more than enough muscle for the majority of applications.&nbsp;Even for most games (like the ones I like to play, including <em>Diablo Immortal</em> and <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>), the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is a great match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OnePlus also hasn't skimped on the 15R's other internal components. You're still getting 12GB of LPDDR5X Ultra RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage. That's the same configuration as the base model of the OP15. This translates to a phone that doesn't miss a beat when switching between apps and loading files like images and videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15R has a slightly bigger battery, coming in at 7,400mAh, up from 7,300mAh on the OP15. In practice, the two phones offer the same amount of battery life. Putting them through both Engadget's video rundown test, they both ran for 38 hours before their batteries died (which makes sense given the OP15R has a bigger screen). Like the OP15, the 15R comes with the OnePlus 55W SUPERVOOC charger in the box. The adapter can get the 15R from dead to 100 percent in less than an hour. If you hate charging your phone, the 15R makes that process as painless as possible, with a battery that both lasts long and won't be at the outlet for hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By this point you're probably wondering what OnePlus cut from the OP15 to make the 15R more affordable. The answer — quite literally — is an entire camera. The new phone is missing a telephoto camera, something you could find on its predecessor, the OnePlus 13R. And as far as I can tell, the two remaining cameras use the same 50-megapixel and 8MP sensors OnePlus shipped on last year's model. The company also hasn't upgraded the glass on either camera. That leaves the selfie camera as the only area to see some change in the form of a sharper 32MP sensor and the addition of autofocus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b702c679-611b-45da-9084-c515bc9fd649" />
<p>Unfortunately, none of the 15R's cameras stand out. As a whole, they suffer from the same set of problems that plague the OnePlus 15's cameras. They're fine out on a sunny day, but as soon as the light becomes a bit challenging, the 15R struggles with shadow details, resulting in muddy pictures. The more I've used both the OP15 and 15R, the more I've come to the conclusion that OnePlus needs to go back to the drawing board with its new Detail Max Engine. It feels like it's holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware.</p>

<p>There's not much to say here other than the 15R ships with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/oxygenos-16-has-new-lock-screen-customization-options-and-a-novel-gemini-integration-184958404.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">OxygenOS 16</a>, just like the OP15. OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That's a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It's hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R's processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company's newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don't care about photos and videos. That's the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you're a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company's devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn't too impressed with the OP15's camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you're getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">other phones in its price range</a>, such as the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Pixel 10</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, the 15R is not as well-rounded, and can't compete with those devices in camera quality, but you're getting much better performance, battery life and a display they can't match. &nbsp; </p>

While keeping your IP address invisible, you can use your VPN to explore streaming content from all over the world or (virtually) sneak into a sports event that&#39;s not available in your area.</p><p>However, while VPNs are widely available, there&#39;s a strange dearth of information on what they actually do behind the scenes. You may know that a VPN masks your device with a proxy server to make it look like you&#39;re somewhere else, and maybe even that encryption is involved. But finding any more details can mean running a gauntlet of misinformation.</p><p>That&#39;s a shame, because the inner workings of a VPN aren&#39;t all that difficult to understand. You may not be able to build one yourself without a degree in computer science, but with a little work, you can understand exactly what it&#39;s doing on your computer. That&#39;s information you can use to select the right VPN for you, and make the most of it once you&#39;ve got it.</p><h2 id="70cde443-d9f2-456a-93b4-59c0b8e7b82a"><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></h2><p>To make sure nobody gets left behind, I&#39;ll start from the beginning. A VPN (virtual private network) is a method of securely accessing a network, either a closed network (like you might have at the office) or the internet as a whole. Initially, organizations set up VPNs so remote workers can work with secure files. While this still happens, the last 15 years have seen VPNs increasingly marketed to individuals, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="slk:Proton VPN;cpos:3;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="slk:ExpressVPN;cpos:4;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> and others seeing massive user growth.</p><p>Broadly, a VPN consists of two parts: the server, which forwards requests to your chosen destination, and the client, a piece of software that lets you interact with the server. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="slk:You can find a longer explanation here;cpos:5;pos:1">You can find a longer explanation here</a>, but I&#39;ll use the two sections below to tell you what you need to know right now.</p><p>One more note before that — there are multiple kinds of VPNs, including the remote-access VPNs and site-to-site VPNs commonly used by workplaces. However, for this article, I&#39;ll be talking mainly about the commercial VPN services sold to individuals for general security needs. Instead of a specific network, these VPNs are designed to handle all of a user&#39;s traffic to any point on the internet.</p><h2 id="5cc696a3-0830-4398-b2ce-ff2c298dab84"><strong>What happens when you use a VPN?</strong></h2><p>First, you use the client to connect to a server — either the fastest one available or a particular location you need. Once you&#39;ve connected, every request you send to the internet goes through the VPN server first. This communication between your device and the web is encrypted so it can&#39;t be traced back to you.</p><p>The VPN server decrypts your requests and sends them on. The destination then communicates with the VPN server, which relays the information back to you — after re-encrypting it so nobody follows it home.</p><p>Since the VPN does everything on your behalf, it&#39;s your &quot;mask&quot; online. Your internet service provider (ISP) and third parties can see what&#39;s being done, but — so long as you’re not otherwise logged in or identifying yourself — nobody knows that it&#39;s you doing it. It&#39;s like having a friend order pizza for you so the pizzeria doesn&#39;t hear you calling for the third time this week (not that I speak from experience).</p><h2 id="3fc61835-654b-42ae-b891-e1a638f125af"><strong>What&#39;s the point of using a VPN?</strong></h2><p>Why add an extra step to the already complex process of getting online? The two biggest reasons are maintaining anonymity and changing your virtual location. I&#39;ve already explained how a VPN keeps you anonymous. Among other things, this prevents your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers and protects activists who face government repercussions for what they do online.</p><p>Changing your virtual location is part of masking, but it can also be used to see the internet as it&#39;s visible in other countries. Streaming services are frequently limited to certain places, and almost all of them change the available content based on their licenses in each nation. You can also use a VPN in a country with a nationwide firewall, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-05-fan-bingxi-great-firewall-of-china.html" data-i13n="slk:like China;cpos:6;pos:1">like China</a>, to see forbidden outside information sources.</p><h2 id="6e0d3680-d238-4f09-9c70-12192098a2bf"><strong>How does a VPN work? The full technical explanation</strong></h2><p>Most online explanations stop after defining a VPN as an anonymous agent between you and the internet — but I wrote this article to go a little bit deeper. To understand what a VPN is doing on a technical level, we&#39;ll need to cover how the internet works, how the VPN knows where to send encrypted information and just what &quot;encryption&quot; actually is.</p><h3 id="02caaf09-a724-4593-b963-d8b790c505c1"><strong>How the internet transmits data</strong></h3><p>When you&#39;re not using a VPN, internet traffic goes directly from your modem to your ISP, then on to your chosen destination. The key technologies here are IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, and TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. They&#39;re usually combined as TCP/IP.</p><p>You may have heard that every online device has an IP address that identifies it to every other device. TCP/IP governs not just those names but how data moves between them. Here&#39;s how it works, step-by-step.</p><ol><li><p>You click a link or enter a URL into your web browser.</p></li><li><p>Your computer sends a request to your modem, asking to see the page associated with the URL. Your modem forwards the request to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>Your ISP finds a domain name server (DNS) that tells it which IP address is connected to the URL you asked to see. It then sends the request to that IP address along the fastest available route, which will involve being relayed between several nodes.</p></li><li><p>That IP address is connected with a server that holds the content you&#39;re looking for. Once it receives the request, it breaks the data down into small packets of about 1 to 1.5 kilobytes.</p></li><li><p>These packets separate to find their own fastest routes back to your ISP, your modem and finally your web browser, which reassembles them.</p></li><li><p>You see a web page, likely no more than a second after you asked for it.</p></li></ol><p>The outgoing requests and inbound packets are key to understanding VPN function. A VPN intervenes during step 2 (when your modem contacts your ISP) and step 5 (when your ISP sends the packets back to you). In the next section, I&#39;ll explain exactly what it does during those steps.</p><h3 id="4bfdc75a-e03c-4367-9846-9aa3f1bf8c98"><strong>How VPN tunneling protects data</strong></h3><p>You might have heard a VPN&#39;s activities described as &quot;tunneling.&quot; That term refers to a figurative tunnel being created between your device and the VPN. Data enters the tunnel when it&#39;s encrypted by the VPN client and exits when it&#39;s decrypted by the VPN server. Between those two points, encryption means nobody can see the true data. It&#39;s as though it&#39;s traveling through an opaque tunnel.</p><p>While the tunnel is a useful metaphor, it may be better to think of VPN encryption as an encapsulation. Each packet of data sent via VPN is &quot;wrapped&quot; in a second packet, which both encrypts the original packet and contains information for reaching the VPN server. However, none of these outer layers have the complete path — each just knows enough to reach the next relay. In this way, the origin point (that&#39;s you) remains invisible.</p><p>The same thing happens when the internet returns content to show you. Your ISP sends the data to the VPN server, because, as far as it knows, that&#39;s where the request came from. The VPN then encrypts each packet and sends them back to you for decryption and reassembly. It takes a little longer with the extra steps; that&#39;s why VPNs always slightly slow down your browsing speed, though the best ones don&#39;t do that by much (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="slk:Surfshark;cpos:7;pos:1">Surfshark</a> is currently the fastest).</p><p>You learned in that last section that two protocols, IP and TCP (usually combined as TCP/IP), are responsible for letting online devices talk to each other, even if they&#39;ve never connected before. In the same way, a VPN protocol is like a shared language that lets VPNs encrypt, move and decrypt information. See the next section to learn how a VPN protocol works in detail.</p><h3 id="795a93d9-5500-4c8a-b5a1-fcfde25c4ccd"><strong>How VPN protocols encrypt data</strong></h3><p>VPN protocols are the technology behind VPNs; every other feature of your VPN is just a method of interacting with them. All protocols are designed to encrypt data packets and wrap them in a second layer that includes information on where to send them. The main differences are the shape of that second layer, the types of encryption used and how the client establishes its initial secure connection with the server.</p><p>It&#39;s extremely common for VPNs to advertise protocols with &quot;bank-grade&quot; or &quot;military-grade&quot; encryption. This is talking about the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is used by financial institutions and the US government and military. AES-256 is indeed some of the strongest available encryption, but it&#39;s only part of the story. As a symmetric algorithm, it&#39;s not fully secure on its own, because the same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt it — and those keys can be stolen.</p><p>For that reason, most VPN protocols use AES-256 (or a similarly strong cipher like ChaCha20) to encrypt the data packets themselves, then combine it with a larger suite of multiple encryption algorithms. One of the most reliable and popular protocols, OpenVPN, uses the asymmetric TLS protocol to establish a secure relationship between client and server, then transmits packets encrypted with AES-256 across that channel, knowing the keys will be safe.</p><p>Explaining this could easily reach the length of a book, but the basic principle isn&#39;t complicated. In asymmetric encryption, a sender encodes data with a unique key, then a recipient decodes it with a different paired key. The keys are provided by a trusted third party. In a maneuver called a TLS handshake, the server and client send each other encrypted data. If each can decode the other&#39;s test data, they know they have a matched pair of keys, which proves that both are the same client and server that got the keys from the trusted authority.</p><p>Why not just use asymmetric encryption for the data itself, if it&#39;s more secure? Mainly, protocols don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s a lot slower. Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of resource-heavy math that makes connections drag. That&#39;s why OpenVPN and others use the asymmetric-to-symmetric two-step instead.</p><p>To summarize, a VPN protocol is a complex set of instructions and tools that control encryption and routing via VPN servers. Protocols still in use include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, SSTP and L2TP. PPTP, one of the oldest protocols, is no longer considered secure. On top of these, VPNs often build their own proprietary protocols, such as ExpressVPN&#39;s Lightway.</p><h2 id="194fe0d7-96f6-4022-bc10-fa63aa7f4be1"><strong>Putting it all together</strong></h2><p>Now that we&#39;ve hit all the relevant information, let&#39;s revisit that step-by-step from earlier, this time with a VPN in the mix. Here are the steps, starting with establishing the VPN connection and ending with anonymously viewing a website.</p><ol><li><p>You open your VPN client, choose a server location and connect. The VPN client and server authenticate each other with a TLS handshake.</p></li><li><p>The client and server exchange the symmetric keys they&#39;ll use to encrypt and decrypt packets for the duration of this session (i.e. until you disconnect). Your VPN client tells you that it&#39;s established a secure tunnel.</p></li><li><p>You open your web browser and enter a URL. Your browser sends a request to view the content at that address.</p></li><li><p>The request goes to your VPN client, which encrypts it and adds an outer layer of information with directions to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The encrypted request reaches the VPN server, which decrypts it and forwards it to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>As normal, your ISP finds the IP address associated with the URL you entered and forwards your request along.</p></li><li><p>The destination server receives the request and sends all the necessary packets of information back to your ISP, which forwards it to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The VPN server encrypts each packet and adds a header directing it to the VPN client.</p></li><li><p>The client decrypts the packets and forwards them to your web browser.</p></li><li><p>You see the web page you opened.</p></li></ol><p>Because of the encrypted tunnel, the request arrives at the VPN server without any information on where it came from. Thus, the VPN doesn&#39;t actually encrypt your activity on the websites themselves — for the most part, the HTTPS protocol does that. Instead, a VPN gives you a false name to put in the register, with no information that could be traced back to your real identity.</p><h2 id="6588ec1f-d408-4bde-bda5-ba8ecd56620e"><strong>How to use this information</strong></h2><p>Now that you know how a VPN works on a technical level, you&#39;re better equipped to choose one for yourself. You can cut through marketing hype statements like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Military-grade encryption!&quot; (It&#39;s the same algorithm everybody uses)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Stay completely anonymous online!&quot; (Plaintext you post on social media is not encrypted)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Dodge ISP throttling!&quot; (If your ISP is throttling you based on your IP address, this works — but if you&#39;re being slowed down because of your moment-to-moment activity, your identity doesn&#39;t matter)</p></li></ul><p>A VPN is just one important part of a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html" data-i13n="slk:complete cybersecurity breakfast;cpos:8;pos:1">complete cybersecurity breakfast</a>. While hiding your IP address, make sure to also use strong passwords, download updates immediately and remain alert for social engineering tactics.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year at CES, Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html">debuted</a> its first mainstream Micro RGB TV, a 115-inch model that surprised us with its rich, vivid colors and $30,000 price tag. Now, the company has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-premium-micro-rgb-lineup-for-2026-with-new-sizes-and-advanced-features">announced</a> that it will be showing off an entire lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES 2026 ranging from 55- to 115-inch models, promising to set &quot;a new standard for premium home viewing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a reminder, Micro RGB is a unique new technology similar to Mini LED displays. Unlike the white backlights used on Mini LEDs, though, it uses tiny red, green and blue LEDs that produce more accurate colors and offer smaller and more controllable dimming zones. However, because pixels can&#39;t be turned on and off individually like Micro LED or OLED, Micro RGB contrast ratios aren&#39;t as high. They promise to be brighter and more color accurate than other technologies, though, hence the high prices and &quot;premium&quot; branding.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung&#39;s upcoming Micro RGB lineup will be available in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models and use the next evolution of the company&#39;s technology. The main claim to fame is near broadcast monitor-like color accuracy, covering 100 percent of the demanding BT.2020 HDR standard. That new standard now has a name and VDE certification: Micro RGB Precision Color 100.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other key features include Samsung&#39;s &quot;Micro RGB AI Engine Pro&quot; for more precise frame-by-frame clarity and realism, new color enhancement functions, Samsung&#39;s glare free tech and enhanced audio features including Dolby Atmos and Adaptive Sound Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, LG <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">announced</a> that it would also show off new televisions using Micro RGB technology, with 75-, 86- and 100-inch models coming next year. What remains to be seen, however, is pricing. Given the $30,000 cost of the 115-inch model, you can likely expect the first Micro RGB televisions to be among the most expensive in the lineups of both LG and Samsung.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html?src=rss]]></description>

There weren&#39;t a ton of microSD Express cards on the market with the Switch 2 first came out, and while they are still not ubiquitous today, you have more options than you did earlier this year. One of the latest to come out is Samsung&#39;s P9 Express card, and it&#39;s on sale right now.</p>

<p>Samsung&#39;s new microSD also comes with the company&#39;s Dynamic Thermal Guard, which should keep things from heating up too much during gameplay. It also works with devices other than the Switch 2, including other gaming consoles, computers, Steam Deck, cameras and more.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s board has formally rejected the $108 billion takeover bid from Paramount Skydance, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-board-of-directors-unanimously-recommends-shareholders-reject-paramount-tender-offer-302644592.html">announced</a>. WBD said it remains committed to its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html">$82.7 billion deal</a> with Netflix, which would close some time next year, pending regulatory approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;[The board] has unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance on December 8, 2025 is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a &quot;Superior Proposal&quot; under the terms of WBD&#39;s merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025,&quot; the studio said in the press release.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Paramount&#39;s offer was funded in part by sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, so it could have triggered a national security review by the US government. However, Paramount said that even if those entities dropped out, the company&#39;s owners (the Ellisons) would &quot;backstop the full amount of the bid.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the board said that Paramount &quot;has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a &#39;full backstop&#39; from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has,&quot; adding that &quot;the terms of the Netflix merger are superior.&quot; WBD explained that Paramount is relying on an &quot;opaque revocable trust&quot; for said backstop which is &quot;no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.&quot; WBD&#39;s board also noted that Paramount expects to achieve $9 billion in cost synergies from the merger, and that &quot;would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2025/Netflix-Welcomes-Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-Recommendation/default.aspx">statement</a>, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that &quot;the Warner Bros. Discovery board reinforced that Netflix&#39;s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders. This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders and the broader entertainment industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Paramount has yet to comment, but the company has previously said that its $30 per share offer is a better deal, due to the all-cash nature (compared to 84 percent cash for Netflix) and fact that it would have a clearer path to regulatory approval due to the Ellison&#39;s supposedly tight relationship with President Trump.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-131055882.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-gaming-subscriptions">Gaming subscriptions</h2> 
<p>Game consoles are certainly among the most popular gift ideas this time of year. If you know someone who’s been so good that they’re getting a new Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, one of these subscriptions will make their shiny toy immediately playable out of the box.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="78e039b67e7a485a9be7a300b64c74e3" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>There’s no doubt that Microsoft has changed the value proposition for its Game Pass subscription service service. It recently <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">raised the price</a> for its most comprehensive Ultimate tier by 50 percent, to $30 a month. That’s a bitter pill to swallow —&nbsp;but devoted players who have an Xbox as their main (or only) console will still get a ton of value out of Game Pass.</p> 
<p>The aforementioned Ultimate tier provides access to more than 500 games that’ll work on Xbox, PC and other supported devices. It’s also the only way to get “day one” release games like <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <em>Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer World 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em>; in recent years other high-profile day one releases have included <em>Doom: The Dark Ages, Starfield, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Forza Motorsport</em> and numerous others. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also have access to the highest quality and fastest game streaming Xbox offers. For a slightly less hardcore Xbox fan, though, the $15-per-month Premium tier is also worth considering.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="7bd823db7e494a4691dfe0cdab58f4c4" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Online-Gift-19-99/dp/B07WP82643"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Nintendo’s Switch Online subscription has gotten some nice upgrades in 2025, the year of the Switch 2. As it has for years, Nintendo offers two different Switch Online plans. The basic $20-per-year plan unlocks online play and enables Switch 2 owners to use the system&#39;s GameChat capabilities. It also includes more than 100 Game Boy, NES and Super NES games, cloud backups of your saved games as well as the occasional special offers. It also includes access to the rather silly but enjoyable Nintendo Music app, so you can listen to your favorite Zelda or Mario tracks at any time.</p> 
<p>The $50 “expansion pack” adds a collection of N64, Game Boy Advance and Sega Genesis games as well as some DLC for games like <em>Mario Kart 8, Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>and <em>Splatoon 2.</em> But most interesting are the new additions for Switch 2 owners: there’s a small but growing library of GameCube games, including classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX.</em> Switch 2 owners who have the expansion pack subscription can also upgrade to the Switch 2 versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> for free.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="0b7f0c8d836d42aea64d419d136146c3" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>A PlayStation Plus subscription is a must-have for any PS5 owners. That’s partially because you need one to play multiplayer games online, but there are plenty of other significant benefits. PS Plus comes in three tiers, but the middle “Extra” plan ($15/month or $135/year) is probably best for most gamers. In addition to cloud storage for saves, online multiplayer support and a couple of free games for your library every month, you get access to the PlayStation Plus catalog, which includes more than 400 PS4 and PS5 games.</p> 
<p>There are a number of heavy hitters here, including <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and <em>II</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima, God of War Ragnarok, Death Stranding, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered </em>and <em>Returnal</em> alongside lower-profile hits and indie games such as <em>Citizen Sleeper, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Dave the Diver </em>and<em> Humanity</em>. If you know someone who loves older games though, the “Premium” tier ($18/month or $160/year) adds a bunch of titles from the PS1 through the PS4 as well as perks like game trials and PS5 game streaming from the cloud.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Amazon’s latest Echo speakers arrived in October, a feature the company spent time hyping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/everything-announced-at-amazons-fall-hardware-event-143557140.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">during its fall devices event</a> was missing. Alexa Home Theater <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-surround-sound-for-echo-speakers-is-rolling-out-now-204557932.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">arrived in late November</a>, allowing owners of a recent Fire TV device and either of the new Echo speakers the ability to use up to five units and an Echo Sub as a surround sound setup. The main selling point is that the underlying tech allows you to put the speakers wherever you want and Alexa Home Theater will handle the rest. A robust array of speakers is a considerable investment, though, and there are limitations to Amazon’s latest play for your living room.</p><h2 id="6ba76f50-c630-458b-aad1-e48fdaab1636">What is Alexa Home Theater?</h2><p>At the most basic level, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-will-let-you-use-amazons-echo-speakers-for-surround-sound-153325469.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Alexa Home Theater</a> is an automatic room calibration tool that’s akin to Trueplay from Sonos, SpaceFit Sound from Samsung or Sound Field Optimization from Sony. The feature, no matter which company builds it, is designed to automatically tune the acoustics of a soundbar or other speakers to the acoustics of the room. These tools allow companies to account for things like high ceilings and weird angles, adjusting audio performance so things sound their best no matter how your home is designed.&nbsp;</p><p>Like similar technologies from other companies, Alexa Home Theater and the latest Echo speakers also support spatial awareness. This allows you to position the speakers however they best fit in your living room and the underlying tech will balance the sound based on their proximity to each other. Gone are the days when you have to put rear speakers in a specific spot in order for them to work.&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest Echo speakers, Amazon overhauled Alexa Home Theater to accommodate more devices in a single setup. Now you can use up to five <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-dot-max-review-disappointing-sound-but-alexa-is-a-star-190000721.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Echo Dot Max</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">second-generation Echo Studio</a> units and a subwoofer at the same time. Of course, this means you can put the compact speakers around the perimeter of your home theater space, providing more immersive surround sound than a single speaker or two can muster. Alexa Home Theater recognizes each Echo speaker and adjusts the system accordingly.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="6748d315-b980-4569-9ffb-dcd3c13b1180">What hardware do I need to use it?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7661.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7661.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max." data-uuid="751570be-4bdd-425d-ae5e-1b1d66c443d9"><figcaption>My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you want to use more than two Echo speakers and a subwoofer in your Alexa Home Theater setup, you’ll need the latest Amazon devices to make that happen. That list includes the Echo Dot Max and second-gen Echo Studio, along with the Echo Sub if you crave more bass. You’ll also need a Fire TV streaming gadget for the multi-speaker option, but it has to be one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Fire TV Cube (3rd gen)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd gen) </p></li><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K (2nd gen)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K Plus</p></li></ul><p>You might be wondering why Alexa Home Theater isn’t supported on other (older) Amazon streaming and audio models. Well, it is… but you’ll only be allowed to pair just two Echo speakers of the same model with an optional subwoofer for a total of three devices.

This two-speaker method is also supported on more Fire TV devices, including some standalone TVs with Amazon’s streaming platform built in.&nbsp;</p><p>In that scenario, it means you could pair two Echo speakers with a subwoofer, for example, and have them play the same audio content with Alexa Home Theater.</p><p>Currently, Amazon says these are Fire TV devices that <em>don’t</em> support Alexa Home Theater:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K Select</p></li><li><p>Amazon Fire TV 2-Series</p></li><li><p>Fire TV 4-Series (2025 Release, newest model)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Omni QLED Series (2025 Release, newest model)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series (2024 Release, newest model)</p></li></ul><h2 id="62306705-8cb6-47fd-82b2-fb10ff00dd09">How to set up Alexa Home Theater</h2><p>Like nearly all home theater speakers and soundbars these days, setting up Alexa Home Theater is easy once you have the required hardware in place. Unlike a lot of the competition, this initial configuration isn’t done in a mobile app — it’s handled by the Settings menu on a compatible Fire TV device. Before you initiate the setup process, you’ll want to make sure your Echo speakers and Fire TV device are up to date. You can ask Alexa to check for updates to the speakers, while you’ll need to check the Device &amp; Software section of the Fire TV Settings menu for those gadgets. Once everything is current, here are the steps to follow to get started with Alexa Home Theater:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your Fire TV.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Display &amp; Sounds.</strong>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Alexa Home Theater</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Create Alexa Home Theater</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select the compatible Echo speakers. You can also add an Echo Sub during this step.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the system. After you select either the second-gen Echo Studio or the Echo Dot Max, hit <strong>Next</strong> and the system will calibrate automatically. If you select other Echo speakers, hit <strong>Next</strong> and then confirm the placement of the speakers before calibration.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When the setup is complete, the Alexa Home Theater system is ready to use. To do so, select either <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>Watch Preview</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h2 id="72c3e5ae-efb1-4322-9f77-da86691a989b">Using Alexa Home Theater with four Echo Studio speakers</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7655.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7655.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue." data-uuid="a4174255-df69-4ded-a0ab-3e4fa059e386"><figcaption>The two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Like most home theater gear, the Fire TV will play short audio clips through each Echo speaker and your TV speakers to determine their location and to calibrate the group to the room. From start to finish, the setup process takes about five minutes — so long as your Fire TV and all speakers are running up-to-date firmware. It’s a quick and straightforward process, which meant I was watching <em>Fallout </em>soon after putting all of the speakers in place.&nbsp;</p><p>While streaming that video game-inspired original series, the Echo Studios provided an immersive audio experience with directional sound and crisp, clear dialogue. The front two speakers handle speech, but there’s some nuance in what direction it’s coming from on screen. Rear speakers are tasked with the bulk of the environmental noise, whether that’s nearby water, passing cars, rain or gunfire — just to name a few. I was also pleasantly surprised by how much bassy rumble these speakers produced during movies and shows. I didn’t think a single unit was particularly adept at low-end tone during my review, but I think it would be just fine to use a collection of Echo Studios without having to add the Echo Sub.&nbsp;</p><p>The overall audio performance here is certainly a boost over any TV’s built-in speakers, but the sense of immersion isn’t as complete as what a soundbar and a pair of rear satellite speakers can provide. Specifically, I felt like the foursome of Echo Studio speakers in my test setup stumbled with the height channels. Despite the angled design of the devices and their multi-driver configurations, the effect of overhead and aerial sounds was quite subdued.&nbsp;</p><p>And the worst part about this is that there’s no way to try to fix it with settings. That’s because there are minimal settings to adjust once Alexa Home Theater is set up. There are two features — dialogue boost and volume leveler — but those are both Fire TV settings rather than items meant for any connected speakers. In the Alexa Home Theater menu, there’s a lip sync tool to address any audio lag, which is a standard item for any soundbar. I would’ve loved to see some kind of channel adjustment at the very least, so that I could dial in the mix a bit rather than relying on Amazon’s preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>If you turn to Alexa for help, the assistant can only change bass, treble and midrange, and it can only do so when prompted by voice commands. When I asked for it to turn up the dialogue, it seemed to just increase the volume. If I asked it to adjust the height channels, Alexa responded affirmatively, but it didn’t sound like any tweaks were applied.&nbsp;Amazon later confirmed that those basic EQ changes are Alexa and actually do here. </p><p>Another gripe I have with Alexa Home Theater is the inability to connect my phone or another device to the entire group for music. You can still sync with individual Echo Studio speakers for music via Bluetooth, but if you want to use the whole shebang, you’ll have to play your tunes from the Fire TV or ask Alexa to help.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire TV platform has plenty of audio streaming apps, but Apple Music isn’t there and that’s where my monthly subscription resides. You have to add the Apple Music skill to the Alexa app on your phone first, then you can stream content from the service by asking Amazon’s assistant. For other services with Fire TV apps, you’re using your TV to play music, and most of the time I want the TV off and to just pick up my phone to blast some Spiritbox. I also like to control the queue from my phone, but alas that’s not an option here.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="7d812f3c-8d33-4c3f-ab25-051c43c35408">Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7344.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7344.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Amazon&#39;s new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model." data-uuid="1c0f434b-4431-483f-8bfe-ace7b313c20b"><figcaption>Amazon&#39;s new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>The main issue with using four Echo Studios and a Fire TV is the cost. For the speakers alone, you’re looking at nearly $900 for the setup I tested. When the new Echo speakers were announced in September, Amazon said it would offer Alexa Home Theater bundles with multiple speakers, but I couldn’t find those on the company’s website. </p><p>For comparison, Sonos currently offers multiple configurations of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">the Beam soundbar</a> and either <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Era 100 speakers</a> or a sub for less than $800. For the same price as four Echo Studio speakers, you can get <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-adds-the-bravia-theater-bar-6-to-its-dolby-atmos-soundbar-lineup-160012544.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Sony’s Bravia Theater System 6</a>, which comes with a soundbar, rear speakers and a subwoofer. There are other options from other companies as well in the $800 range, and most people will likely be happier with a dedicated soundbar-based setup than four Echo units and a subwoofer. Hello, AirPlay and Google Cast.</p><p>From an aesthetic perspective, I can see why someone might opt for multiple Echo speakers instead of a mid-sized (or larger) soundbar. Two Echo Studios on either side of my TV with the two rear units tucked away on a shelf certainly creates a clean look. And in terms of sound, using two Echo Studio speakers, let alone four like I tested, will provide a noticeable boost over a TV’s built-in speakers. However, the lack of customization and the inability to control music from my phone for an Alexa Home Theater group makes it hard to recommend Amazon’s latest for shoppers looking for more immersive audio in the living room. Hopefully the company will continue to refine this feature so that it’s more capable in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-newest-echo-feature-130000328.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is in discussions with OpenAI to invest $10 billion in the company while supplying more of its AI chips and cloud computing services, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/4217107e-2c98-4b78-9961-67d75237fac4"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>. The deal would push OpenAI&#39;s valuation over $500 billion but is likely to raise more questions about the company&#39;s circular investment agreements involving chips and data centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two companies are also in talks about the possibility of OpenAI helping Amazon with its online marketplace, similar to deals it has made with Etsy, Shopify and Instacart. However, any agreement still wouldn&#39;t allow Amazon to market OpenAI&#39;s most advanced models on its developer cloud platform, as Microsoft holds the exclusive rights to those until the 2030s.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal">recently restructured</a> its agreement with Microsoft to allow it to use data center capacity from other suppliers. Around the same time, it made a string of deals with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal">NVIDIA</a>, Oracle, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-agrees-to-buy-tens-of-billions-worth-of-amd-chips-134816630.html">AMD</a> and others to build out data center capacity and acquire or rent AI chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new deal would require OpenAI to use Amazon&#39;s Trainium AI chips and rent more data center capacity from Amazon Web Services (AWS). That&#39;s on top of the $38 billion that OpenAI has already committed to renting servers from AWS over the next seven years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These deals have sounded alarms among investors considering their circular nature. In many of those, including this latest Amazon deal, OpenAI is taking investment money and then sending that cash back to the same company for infrastructure or chips. And the amounts are staggering, with just two companies, Softbank and Oracle, spending a combined $400 billion on new data centers for OpenAI&#39;s compute needs. And so far, OpenAI has lost more money than it makes.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-10-billion-in-openai-and-supply-its-trainium-chips-103653151.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-chromebooks-faqs">Best Chromebooks FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-chrome-os-and-why-would-i-use-it-over-windows">What is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?</h3> 
<p>This is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome&#39;s operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Of course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.</p> 
<p>Google and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.</p> 
<p>Chromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-do-chromebooks-do-well">What do Chromebooks do well?</h3>

<p>Put simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data.</p> 
<p>Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.</p> 
<p>If you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/">Google’s AI Pro plan</a> — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.</p> 
<p>As for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.</p> 
<p>Finally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-most-important-specs-for-a-chromebook">What are the most important specs for a Chromebook?</h3> 
<figure>
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/802219e0-e781-11ee-9dfb-c69cf3b4e4c4" data-uuid="f74f05fd-0f4c-38a8-a8a3-ddef51260719">

<p>Chrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day.</p> 
<p>Chromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.</p> 
<p>Of course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.</p> 
<p>Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-should-i-spend-on-a-chromebook">How much should I spend on a Chromebook?</h3> 
<p>Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.</p> 
<p>There are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.</p>

It’s a few years older than our current top pick, so its processor isn’t fresh and it only has 128GB of storage. It also won’t get updates from Google as long as newer models. But it still combines a nice screen and keyboard with solid performance. This laptop typically costs $500, which feels high given its a few years old and Acer’s Chromebook Plus 514 is only $350, but if you can find it on sale and can’t find the Acer it’s worth a look.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-cx15">ASUS CX15</h3>

That price and its large 15.6-inch screen is mainly what it has going for it, as the Intel Celeron N4500 chip and 4GB of RAM powering it does not provide good performance if you’re doing anything more than browsing with a few tabs open. If you’re shopping for someone with extremely basic needs and have a small budget, the CX15 might fit the bill. But just be aware that you get what you pay for.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</h3> 
<p>Samsung’s <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-quirky-in-ways-both-good-and-bad-140036965.html">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss]]></description>

Back in 2022, the California DMV <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/california-dmv-accuses-tesla-false-advertising-130350292.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">accused the automaker</a> of using deceptive language to advertise those products and making  it seem like its vehicles are capable of level 5 autonomous driving. Tesla has since added the word “Supervised” to the name of its Full Self-Driving assistance technology.  </p><p>As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/tesla-s-sales-in-california-set-to-be-suspended-dmv-says?srnd=homepage-americas" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, the DMV asked the administrative law judge if a suspension is warranted based on the evidence it presented. Even though the judge has agreed that it is, the agency will give Tesla 90 days to explain its side and remove any untrue or misleading language in the marketing materials for the products. Tesla’s sales and manufacturing in California will only be suspended if it doesn’t comply within that timeframe.</p><p>“We’re really asking Tesla to do their job, as they’ve done in other markets, to properly brand these vehicles,” said California DMV director, Steve Gordon, in a statement.</p><p>A suspension in California could be devastating for the automaker. While new Tesla registrations in the state plummeted earlier this year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-first-quarter-registrations-california-fell-15-industry-data-shows-2025-04-16/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Reuters</a> says California accounts for nearly a third of the company’s sales in the country. In addition, Tesla only manufactures its Model S and X vehicles in its Fremont plant, where it also produces Model 3 and Model Y units. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-used-deceptive-language-to-market-autopilot-california-judge-rules-035826786.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite changing its name and using decidedly bird-free branding, X is trying to hold on to its original Twitter trademarks, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>TechCrunch </em>reports</a>. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">xAI-owned social media platform</a> has updated its terms of service to include references to Twitter after previously only mentioning X, and seemingly attempted to counter a startup&#39;s petition to cancel the company&#39;s Twitter trademarks with a petition of its own.</p><p>The startup X appears to be responding to is Operation Bluebird, a company cofounded by former Twitter general counsel Stephen Coates that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/can-twitter-fly-again-startup-wants-to-pry-iconic-trademark-from-musks-x/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">went public last week </a>with plans to capture what remains of Twitter for its own use. The first step in that process was filing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26364751-ttabvue-92090266-can-1/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a petition</a> with the US Patents and Trademark Office to cancel X&#39;s control of Twitter’s trademarks.</p><p>&quot;The TWITTER and TWEET brands have been eradicated from X Corp.’s products, services and marketing, effectively abandoning the storied brand, with no intention to resume use of the mark,&quot; Operation Bluebird explained in the petition. “Petitioner seeks to use and register the TWITTER and TWEET brands for new products and services, including a social media platform that will be located at the website <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://twitter.new" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">twitter.new</a></a>.&quot;</p><p>In fairness to Operation Bluebird, Elon Musk was very open about his plan to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-is-rebranding-twitter-to-x-and-killing-the-bird-logo-165944573.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">abandon the Twitter name and bird logo</a> after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">he acquired the company</a> in 2022. &quot;And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Musk posted</a> in July 2022, not long before Twitter was rebranded to X. Even after the platform rebranded, though, at least one remnant of the original Twitter brand has stuck around: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Twitter.com" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Twitter.com</a></a> still redirects to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://X.com" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">X.com</a></a>.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The updated <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/en/tos" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">terms of service</a> <em>TechCrunch</em> spotted now say that as of January 16, 2025, &quot;nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.&quot; The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gerbenlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DDE-1-25-cv-01510-1.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">counterpetition</a> also reiterates that the Twitter trademarks are X&#39;s &quot;exclusive property.&quot;</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Coates said that Operation Bluebird’s cancellation petition was “based on well-established trademark law” and that he believes the upstart will prevail. “X legally abandoned the TWITTER mark, publicly declared the Twitter brand ‘dead,’ and spent substantial resources establishing a new brand identity. Our cancellation petition is based on well-established trademark law and we believe we will be successful. They said goodbye. We say hello.”</p><p>At the time of writing, Operation Bluebird has convinced over 145,200 people to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.twitter.new/" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">claim a handle</a> on the company&#39;s new social platform. Maybe X sees that early interest as a threat, but it&#39;s just as possible Operation Bluebird&#39;s public comments were enough to tip the company off so it could try to hold on to trademarks it clearly believes still hold some value.</p><p><strong>Update, December 16, 2025, 4:13PM PT:</strong> This story was updated to add a statement from Stephen Coates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-was-spooked-enough-by-new-twitter-to-change-its-terms-of-service-231138305.html?src=rss]]></description>

For example, I played 28 games this year; the Steam median is only four. My longest play streak was 15 days; the median is six.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its last <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/16/xbox-december-2025-update-mobile-app-updates-audio-support/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Xbox-focused software update</a> of the year, Microsoft is improving the Bluetooth performance of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-xbox-wireless-headset-receives-microphone-and-battery-life-upgrades-151455182.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xbox Wireless Headset</a> to make it work even better with Windows 11. Microsoft released the latest Wireless Headset as an accessory for Xbox Series X/S and PC, but as of this update, Xbox Wireless Headset owners on Windows will now have a leg up on their console counterparts thanks to support for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio.</p><p>Microsoft says that supporting Bluetooth LE Audio will let the headset offer lower latency audio, better battery life, richer stereo sound and the ability to share audio across multiple compatible Bluetooth accessories at the same time. Not revolutionary updates, but still nice to have if you bought a $110 Xbox Wireless Headset back in 2024. Provided you&#39;re running the latest version of Windows 11 and your device supports Bluetooth LE, Microsoft says you can take advantage of the improvements by updating your headset in the Xbox Accessories app.</p><p>If you&#39;re a regular user of the Xbox mobile app, Microsoft is also making some changes there. After adding the ability <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/xbox-april-update-buy-games-xbx-app-stream-your-own-game-console/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to purchase Xbox games directly from the app</a> in April — a feature made possible after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-has-to-open-up-the-play-store-in-epic-games-antitrust-ruling-195239228.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Google</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-allow-external-payment-options-123039994.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Apple</a> were forced to change the rules of their app stores — Microsoft is now adding a dedicated Store tab to the app. You&#39;ll also be able to add games to your wishlist and search for add-ons and DLC directly in the app.</p><p>Microsoft ending the year with Windows and mobile app updates reflects the ways the company&#39;s gaming strategy has changed in 2025. After spending decades positioning itself as a console maker, Microsoft is seemingly making Xbox software its main focus going forward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-last-xbox-update-of-2025-includes-a-handy-wireless-headset-upgrade-204500386.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s at it again, once more insisting that AI is something people need or want more of in their lives. The latest move comes from YouTube Gaming, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeGaming/status/2000989303086649637" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> an open beta for a project called Playables Builder. This allows select YouTube Creators to use a &quot;prototype web app built using Gemini 3&quot; to make bite-sized games, no coding required.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTube is launching a closed Beta test for Playables Builder, a prototype web app built using Gemini 3 where users create games with short text, video or image prompts. we’ve partnered with YouTube Creators like <a href="https://twitter.com/sambucha?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sambucha</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AyChristene?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AyChristene</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/goharsguide?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@goharsguide</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Mogswamp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Mogswamp</a> to start making… <a href="https://t.co/1Gx0v4oZFA">pic.twitter.com/1Gx0v4oZFA</a></p>— YouTube Gaming (@YouTubeGaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeGaming/status/2000989303086649637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>YouTube was testing the addition of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-testing-bitesize-games-on-desktop-and-mobile-163742756.html?guccounter=1" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">small-scale games</a> to its desktop and mobile platforms back in 2023, then added <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/youtube-introduces-multiplayer-mini-games-on-playables-133056235.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">multiplayer capability</a> to Playables last year. Since AI is appearing all over Google-owned services, today&#39;s news probably shouldn&#39;t be a surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The premise sounds similar to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-disco-is-an-experimental-web-browser-that-builds-ai-widgets-based-on-your-tabs-180000701.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Disco and GenTabs</a> projects that Google Labs recently announced. They offer an AI layer to web browsing: provide a natural language input, get an interactive widget that does what you asked for. Despite my skeptical attitude toward AI, I can see those tools having some practical applications for search, where the goal is to aggregate whatever data you&#39;re looking for into a manageable, easy-to-read interface.&nbsp;</p><p>But a game is not simple. A good game takes what might be a simple idea and, with finesse and iteration and skill, transforms it into a genuinely fun experience. It&#39;s a cute parlor trick that AI assistants can help people to make stuff without technical knowledge, but there&#39;s a reason professional game devs work hard to amass all their know-how. Playables Builder is a peak example of misunderstanding what artificial intelligence is best at. Just because a chatbot can make a game doesn&#39;t mean anyone will enjoy playing it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-is-letting-creators-make-playable-games-with-a-gemini-3-tool-195500318.html?src=rss]]></description>

Holiday discounts running through December 29 bring the anime streaming service&#39;s year-long Fan subscription from $80 down to $67 and its Mega Fan subscription from $120 down to $100. That&#39;s either $13 or $20 off access to one of the largest libraries of anime series and movies out there.</p> 
<p>While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll&#39;s library, new episodes &quot;shortly after they air in Japan&quot; and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Notably missing from either subscription is access to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/a-new-crunchyroll-manga-mobile-app-arrives-later-this-year-155234860.html"><ins>Crunchyroll&#39;s new Manga service</ins></a>, but unless you&#39;re specifically looking for reading material, you&#39;ll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll&#39;s video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You&#39;ll find long-running series like <em>One Piece</em> and newer hits like <em>Spy X Family</em>, alongside hundreds of more niche series.</p> 
<p>Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-220920170.html"><ins>acquired by Sony</ins></a>, it&#39;s been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/crunchyroll-blames-third-party-vendor-for-ai-subtitle-mess-145621606.html"><ins>produced poor results</ins></a>. It&#39;s hard to beat Crunchyroll&#39;s library, though, and for as little as $65, you&#39;ll get more than your money&#39;s worth.</p>

The partnership covers new episodes from more than 15 popular podcasts, including <em>The Breakfast Club</em>, <em>Dear Chelsea</em>,<em> My Favorite Murder</em> and others. Customers will have access to video podcast episodes in early 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to new footage, the partnership includes a select library of archival episodes from each show. It&#39;s worth noting that YouTube already platforms video versions of many popular podcasts, including stuff like <em>The Breakfast Club</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This follows a similar deal from earlier this year in which Netflix announced plans to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/some-spotify-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-180000074.html">stream video podcast episodes from Spotify</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in September during Meta Connect, the company previewed a new ability for its smart glasses lineup called Conversation Focus. The feature, which is able to amplify the voices of people around you, is now starting <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ai-glasses-v21-software-update-conversation-focus-soundtrack-your-world-spotify/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">to roll out</a> in the company&#39;s latest batch of software updates.</p><p>When enabled, the feature is meant to make it easier to hear the people you&#39;re speaking with in a crowded or otherwise noisy environment. &quot;You’ll hear the amplified voice sound slightly brighter, which will help you distinguish the conversation from ambient background noise,” Meta <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ai-glasses-v21-software-update-conversation-focus-soundtrack-your-world-spotify/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">explains</a>. It can be enabled either via voice commands (&quot;hey Meta, start Conversation Focus&quot;) or by adding it as a dedicated &quot;tap-and-hold&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-smart-glasses-have-a-new-shortcut-to-call-and-text-without-saying-hey-meta-213303178.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">shortcut</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta is also adding a new multimodal AI feature for Spotify. With the update, users can ask their glasses to play music on Spotify that corresponds with what they&#39;re looking at by saying “hey Meta, play a song to match this view.” Spotify will then start a playlist &quot;based on your unique taste, customized for that specific moment.&quot; For example, looking at holiday decor might trigger a similarly-themed playlist, though it&#39;s not clear how Meta and Spotify may translate more abstract concepts into themed playlists.&nbsp;</p><p>Both updates are starting to roll out now to Meta Ray-Ban glasses (both Gen 1 and Gen 2 models), as well as the Oakley Meta HSTN frames. The update will arrive first to those enrolled in Meta&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/early-access-program/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1">early access</a> program, and will be available &quot;gradually&quot; to everyone else.</p><p>Meta&#39;s newest mode of smart glasses, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> shades, are also getting some new features in the latest software update. Meta is adding the option to trigger specific commands with a single word, rather than having to say &quot;hey Meta.&quot; For example, saying &quot;photo&quot; will be enough to snap a picture and saying &quot;video&quot; will start a new recording. The company says the optional feature is meant to help athletes &quot;save some breath&quot; while on a run or bike ride.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-rolling-out-conversation-focus-and-ai-powered-spotify-features-to-its-smart-glasses-192133928.html?src=rss]]></description>
