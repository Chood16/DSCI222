In September, developer The Game Bakers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/survival-climbing-game-cairn-has-been-delayed-until-2026-171512591.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">pushed back</a> the game&#39;s planned 2025 debut to give some extra time for polish. Today, the team dropped a fresh trailer announcing the revised launch date for the project. <em>Cairn</em> will be available on January 29, 2026 for Steam and PlayStation 5 for $30.</p><p>The Game Bakers have a solid track record of indie gems, often with a strong, unique sense of place and character. The survival-climbing experience seems like an excellent new topic for the team behind games including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/haven-rpg-nintendo-switch-ps4-epic-game-store-182515301.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Haven</em></a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-05-furi-for-xbox-one.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Furi</em></a>. <em>Cairn</em> captures the intensity of winding your way up a mountain and paints a psychological portrait of the people who are drawn to tackling that mental and physical challenge. And if you find the basic gameplay isn&#39;t difficult enough, there will also be a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/climbing-game-cairn-will-have-a-free-solo-mode-with-no-rope-213450638.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">free solo mode</a> for channelling your inner daredevil without ropes. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cairns-new-release-date-is-january-29-2026-211508330.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roskomnadzor, Russia&#39;s federal agency for monitoring and censoring mass media, has blocked access to Snapchat and FaceTime in the country, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/russia-expands-limits-with-snapchat-facetime-ban-interfax-says?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>, citing Russian news service Interfax. The bans were reportedly put in place because the platforms were used &quot;to organize and carry out terrorist acts,” and commit fraud.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear if either service is still accessible by using a VPN, but banning Snapchat and FaceTime fits with Russia’s crackdown on communication and social platforms that started after the country’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-blocks-facebook-183925073.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Facebook</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-block-russia-210603308.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">X</a> were blocked in March of that year, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-bans-instagram-130215448.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Instagram</a> was added to the ban list not long after.

We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>Banning or restricting these platforms is a way to exert control over where and how conversation happens in Russia — and prevent the spread of &quot;LGBT propaganda,&quot; if you believe Roskomnadzor&#39;s reasoning for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/russia-blocks-roblox-citing-lgbt-propaganda-as-a-reason-180757267.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">banning Roblox</a> — but it might also be an attempt to drive people to use &quot;MAX,&quot; a state-run super app that offers services like communication, banking and document storage. The app is part of a long-standing push to rely on Russia&#39;s tech industry rather than foreign companies, and could potentially give the Russian government an easier method for surveilling its citizens, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=049b4de6-a4d2-41d0-a481-88bad77c8e72&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=The+New+York+Times+reports&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEwLzIxL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9ydXNzaWEtbWF4LWFwcC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNDliNGRlNi1hNGQyLTQxZDAtYTQ4MS04OGJhZDc3YzhlNzIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjUvMTAvMjEvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3J1c3NpYS1tYXgtYXBwLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbzLCtIuNKEr1p8cy3cofFGnXh28XDxoHiiSjIPMMcH4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F10%2F21%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Frussia-max-app.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/world/europe/russia-max-app.html"><em>The New York Times</em> reports</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/russia-reportedly-bans-snapchat-and-facetime-194906404.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is reportedly considering discontinuing use of the US Postal Service and building out its own shipping network to rival it, according to The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/04/usps-amazon-delivery/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>. The e-commerce behemoth spends more than $6 billion a year on the public mail carrier, representing just shy of 8 percent of the service&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.usps.com/2025/11/14/usps-reports-year-end-financial-results-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">total revenues</a>. That&#39;s up from just shy of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/09/17/usps-trump-coronavirus-amazon-foia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">$4 billion in 2019</a>, and Amazon continues to grow.</p>
<p>However, it sounds like that split might be due to a breakdown in negotiations between Amazon and the USPS rather than Amazon proactively pullings its business. Amazon provided Engadget with the following statement regarding the <em>Post</em>&#39;s reporting and its negotiations with the USPS:&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together. We’ve continued to discuss ways to extend our partnership that would increase our spend with them, and we look forward to hearing more from them soon — with the goal of extending our relationship that started more than 30 years ago. We were surprised to hear they want to run an auction after nearly a year of negotiations, so we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we&#39;re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers.&quot;</p>
<p>The auction Amazon is referring to would be a &quot;reverse auction,&quot; according to the <em>Post. </em>The USPS would be offering its mailing capabilities to the highest bidder, essentially making Amazon and other high-volume shippers compete for USPS resources. This move would reportedly be a result of the breakdown in talks between Amazon and the USPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Amazon has invested heavily in shipping logistics, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-buys-11-boeing-767-300-planes-193659460.html">buying its own Boeing planes</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-van-150930487.html">debuting electric delivery vans</a> and slowly building out a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/amazon-drones-can-now-deliver-smartphones-airtags-and-more-164413100.html">drone delivery network</a>. Last year, Amazon handled over 6.3 billion parcels, a 7 percent increase over the previous year, according to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Pitney Bowes;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=efd10968-50bf-4400-9262-275e5abcd229&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=470cf9d8-3972-4b28-af1a-8b24b78301aa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Pitney+Bowes&amp;linkText=Pitney+Bowes+parcel+shipping+index&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5waXRuZXlib3dlcy5jb20vdXMvc2hpcHBpbmctaW5kZXguaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDcwY2Y5ZDgtMzk3Mi00YjI4LWFmMWEtOGIyNGI3ODMwMWFhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5waXRuZXlib3dlcy5jb20vdXMvc2hpcHBpbmctaW5kZXguaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARueYG5i1VAG6RHLxwtHAk59XCEURdPytFMCtedzzxp4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pitneybowes.com%2Fus%2Fshipping-index.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/shipping-index.html">Pitney Bowes parcel shipping index</a>. USPS, for its part, handled roughly 6.9 billion, just a 3 percent increase over 2023. That is to say that Amazon&#39;s shipping network can already handle over 90 percent of the volume of the US Postal Service (at least by sheer numbers).</p>
<p>The USPS has been in dire financial condition for some time, <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-postal-service-seeks-reforms-it-reports-9-billion-yearly-loss-2025-11-14/">losing billions of dollars</a> a year. Negotiations between Amazon and the public carrier have reportedly stalled, which, together with the agency&#39;s need to keep raising its prices, may create more urgency for the company to eliminate its reliance on the service altogether.</p>
<p>The Postal Service has struggled to modernize and adapt (its attempt to electrify the truck fleet <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/postal-services-plan-to-electrify-mail-trucks-falling-far-short-of-its-goal-190317071.html">was a bust</a>) in a market where the likes of Amazon and Walmart are investing billions in delivering packages around the country at lightning speed. The ever-accelerating digitization of communication and heavy investment in privately owned shipping operations threatens the very existence of one of the country&#39;s greatest public goods.</p>

The hub will also have a new AI chat feature so users can ask questions about account issues or Meta&#39;s policies. An in-app support hub might not be that helpful if you can&#39;t access your account, though. A Meta spokesperson pointed to its external <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/account-recovery-support/?" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1">account recovery</a> tool, which is meant to help people get back into their accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>Recovering hacked accounts has long been a pain point for Facebook and Instagram users. But Meta says that it&#39;s now improved the process with better email and text alerts. AI has also helped the company&#39;s systems detect devices and locations you&#39;ve frequently used in the past. &quot;Our new account recovery experience adjusts to your particular situation with clearer guidance and simpler verification,&quot; Meta writes. &quot;We’ve also expanded recovery methods to include taking an optional selfie video to further verify your identity.&quot;</p><p>Meta is also starting to test a new &quot;AI support assistant&quot; on Facebook that can provide &quot;instant, personalized help&quot; for issues like account recovery or managing your profile. It&#39;s not clear how this will work, or if it will enable people to talk to an actual person who works for Meta. For now, the most reliable way to access live support is via a Meta Verified subscription, though many users report that the chat-based service <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/how-an-oregon-court-became-the-stage-for-a-115000-showdown-between-meta-and-facebook-creators-150000952.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">isn&#39;t able</a> to help with more complex issues.</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said that the assistant is in the &quot;early stages of testing&quot; and is currently only available to some Facebook users globally. Those who are part of the test can find it via the app&#39;s new support hub.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Meta, these improvements have already shown some success in helping people get back into hacked accounts. The company says that this year it has &quot;increased the relative success rate of hacked account recovery by more than 30% in the US and Canada.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-says-its-fixing-its-broken-support-system-with-the-help-of-ai-185348328.html?src=rss]]></description>

We gave it a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">93 in our review</a> thanks to features like its larger 7.9-inch LCD screen with HCR and very polished design. We were also impressed by its 256GB of base storage, magnetic Joy-Con and overall much improved performance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nintendo introduced <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-mario-kart-world-is-the-opposite-of-punishing-110039837.html"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> alongside the new Switch and we're big fans. It brings wall riding and rail grinds to the <em>Mario Kart</em> franchise in a bright, colorful space.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-adds-the-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-and-scribe-3-to-its-writing-tablet-lineup-145031938.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced the latest series of Kindle Scribe writing tablets in October</a>, Amazon didn’t have a specific release date to share beyond “later this year.” And now that we’re approaching the final weeks of 2025, the company is meeting its own deadline by sharing that it will be available on December 10. That detail is now posted on <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DWRBVDN6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=56ec9faa-33e5-42e2-9944-031d11b2d235&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=the+Amazon+product+page+for+the+Kindle+Scribe+Colorsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRFdSQlZETjY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTZlYzlmYWEtMzNlNS00MmUyLTk5NDQtMDMxZDExYjJkMjM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRFdSQlZETjYiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVwrZfWO3jGHFq5_ndSKcKw6d0gYfCS2a7n-TEDbGFtF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DWRBVDN6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWRBVDN6">the Amazon product page for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft</a>, if you’d like to see the date for yourself. </p>
<p>As a refresher, this is the third generation of the Kindle Scribe line of E Ink writing tablets. This year was the first time Amazon made three different versions of the Scribe, turning it into a series of products. At the entry-level, the Scribe without a front light will start at $430, while the model with a front light starts at $480. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which, as it name suggests, can render colors, will start at $630.</p>
<p>All three flavors will feature the updated hardware and design that’s a bit more symmetrical than previous generations, which had a thicker bezel on one side. They’re also thinner than older Scribes and come with redesigned Kindle software that can help make note-taking a bit more efficient. Based on my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-colorsoft-hands-on-vivid-and-responsive-145147981.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">hands-on with the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft</a>, it also seemed to render colors more vividly than competing devices like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">the reMarkable Paper Pro</a>, though I’ll definitely need to get a review unit in for better comparison. </p>
<p>For now, check out our hands on of the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and review of the reMarkable Paper Pro and even <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">of the last-gen Kindle Scribe</a> to see if this is something you might want. While December 10 is cutting it pretty close to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-tech-gifts-and-cool-gadgets-for-2025-140052697.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">the holiday gifting season</a>, it’s still weeks ahead of Christmas, so it might still be worth keeping an eye on.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is reportedly planning steep cuts to its metaverse division, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/meta-s-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-for-metaverse-efforts?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=e4c2140d-5a36-4a76-92aa-da96a86d8631&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. This is happening just a few years after the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html"><ins>changed its name from Facebook</ins></a> to reflect its renewed interest in that same metaverse.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> notes that the metaverse department could get hit with significant budget cuts in the near future, with layoffs potentially occurring early next year. The budget cuts could go as high as 30 percent and will likely impact the virtual worlds product <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-worlds-now-available-us-canada-192520479.html"><ins>Meta Horizon Worlds</ins></a> and the Quest virtual reality headset. The publication did note that this isn&#39;t a done deal just yet.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Company insiders say this is all part of Meta&#39;s annual budget planning for 2026 and that the cuts were discussed at a series of meetings at CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s compound in Hawaii. The metaverse team was reportedly asked for deeper-than-average cuts because the technology hasn&#39;t exactly taken the world by storm.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the whole metaverse idea has been a dud with investors, who see it as a drain on resources. Consumers aren&#39;t exactly keen on the idea either, even if they still buy <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-quest-store-revenue-milestone-2025-update/"><ins>VR headsets and traditional games</ins></a>. It&#39;s one thing to throw on a headset to shoot bad guys for 20 minutes but it&#39;s a whole other thing to, well, wander around a fake Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for hours looking to spend real money on fake clothing for an avatar.</p>
<div id="970b011619034da38b632ce54d689de2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24META&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$META</a> has spent $37.7B on reality labs over the last two years <a href="https://t.co/ppW7uo2sGB">pic.twitter.com/ppW7uo2sGB</a></p>— Buddy Wiseman-Barker (@buddy_barker) <a href="https://twitter.com/buddy_barker/status/1996593144478028188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>The report does suggest that Zuckerberg still believes that people will one day spend the majority of their time in virtual worlds, but these cuts signal that he understands that this idea is still years or decades away from fruition. The metaverse sits within a company division called Reality Labs <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-reality-labs-had-its-best-quarter-but-still-lost-4-billion-231135719.html"><ins>that has lost more</ins></a> than <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/29236/operating-loss-of-metas-reality-labs-division/?srsltid=AfmBOorZuOQnZbfqbUKoCJ0R0lZx4nj5YoRiRADNknEefP79YIGPKohk"><ins>$70 billion since 2021</ins></a>. Zuckerberg has also largely refrained from mentioning the metaverse in public and in earnings calls.</p>
<p>So what will Meta be spending money on instead? It&#39;s reportedly focused on further developing large AI models and chatbots, in addition to hardware products linked to AI experiences like those <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html"><ins>Ray-Ban smart display glasses</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-reportedly-going-to-slash-spending-on-the-metaverse-164547153.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you like both electric vehicles and emotional roller coasters, 2025 was an excellent year. However, for those of us whose nerves are already sufficiently frazzled, the highs and lows of the last 12 months were a bit hard to stomach.</p><p>In 2025, we saw the introduction of new, compelling models like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-lucid-gravity-is-the-coolest-three-row-ev-on-the-market-120024089.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lucid Gravity</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nissan-leaf-2026-review-still-the-budget-ev-to-beat-173000858.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">refreshed Nissan Leaf</a>, the latter available at a price on par with its internally combusted competition. From a product availability standpoint, 2025 was the year the EV market started feeling more mature and less manic.</p><p>But 2025 also saw new heights of anti-EV vitriol stirred up during a particularly traumatic election cycle. The means of propulsion or badge on the hood of your commuter machine suddenly became an indicator of your political affiliations. Put simply, the car you drive is now a political statement, and it’s the latest unprecedented situation in an exhaustingly long and dire string of unprecedented situations. Yes, it&#39;s been a long year, and the pessimism of 2025 will surely carry us well into 2026, but not all hope is lost for EVs.</p><h2 id="da25d5e0-7acd-481a-a641-d40dd3b5b6bb">Tesla and the DOGE effect</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/8025df00-2365-11f0-8d7b-a4c3f628eae9" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/8025df00-2365-11f0-8d7b-a4c3f628eae9" style="height:4001px;width:6000px;" alt="Elon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads &quot;DOGE&quot; to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025.

Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca was even considered a potential presidential candidate once upon a time. However, we have never seen the kind of ass kissing and cronyism we were privy to in this year&#39;s fickle friendship between Elon Musk and President Trump.</p><p>Musk was (hyper) active on the Trump campaign trail, and wasted no time digging into what he described as government overspending. While the Department of Government Efficiency&#39;s efficacy is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/12/trump-doge-contract-claims-savings-inflation-00498178" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">debatable</a>, it certainly proved quite effective at decimating the accounts of Tesla investors. Between January and March, Tesla&#39;s stock price dropped by nearly half. Things didn&#39;t turn around until <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-leaves-doge-amid-tanking-tesla-sales-153859407.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Musk left DOGE in May</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Tesla&#39;s price has returned to its highs before the DOGE debacle. Its sales, however, have not. Q1 deliveries declined by 13 percent, then 14 percent in Q2. Deliveries bounced back 7 percent in Q3 as everyone scrambled to buy before the EV credits expired, but profits plunged 37 percent. Tesla&#39;s market share in the US electric vehicle space has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/new-ev-market-trends-report" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">halved</a>, leading perennial pitchman Musk to start hawking everything from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-must-spent-almost-an-hour-talking-about-grok-without-mentioning-its-nazi-problem-061101656.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI agents</a> to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-humanoid-robot-is-just-another-tesla-publicity-stunt-224744731.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">spandex-clad robots</a> — anything to distract from the numbers.</p><p>And it&#39;s apparently working. Musk&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation-package-233217531.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">$1 trillion pay package</a> was approved by Tesla’s shareholders without much worry. This could make him the world&#39;s first trillionaire, but only if he meets a series of aggressive targets and deadlines for sales, an area where the man has struggled in the past.</p><h2 id="4e07ca4f-49a4-4f58-b593-7edc6e3056ef">The big, beautiful sales spike</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/3da01610-e903-11ef-bdfd-570feee8e0c6" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/3da01610-e903-11ef-bdfd-570feee8e0c6" style="height:2548px;width:3822px;" alt="A Tesla with a sticker referring to the car&#39;s purchase is shown on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024 in Concord, Mass..

After cutting its own EV incentive program in 2023, Germany&#39;s EV sales fell off a cliff, dropping 28 percent in 2024. Cue the predictions of the demise of EVs by many local pundits.</p><p>Since then, though, EV sales slowly climbed back up, and lately they&#39;ve been booming, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-german-car-sales-more-than-halved-october-2025-11-05/" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">German road traffic agency KBA saying</a> the total number of newly registered electric vehicles increased by nearly 50 percent in October (year over year). Electric cars now make up 19 percent of the market there, and that&#39;s despite Tesla&#39;s sales cratering.</p><p>There&#39;s no guarantee that the American market will follow a similar rebound, especially if the anti-EV political messaging continues. Me, though, I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m staying optimistic, as exhausting as that can be these days.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html?src=rss]]></description>

If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.” He added that, while the game was still in early development, Bad Robot was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.badrobotgames.com/invite" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">opening up a waitlist</a> for access to playtests.</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251204785431/en/Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-Partners-With-Bad-Robot-Games-to-Produce-and-Publish-the-Studios-First-Internally-Developed-Game" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">a press release</a>, “Bad Robot Games is a dedicated game studio working on new and existing transmedia franchises.” So, this project could well be part of an entirely new franchise, but the prospect of co-op shooter from the designer of Left 4 Dead that’s set in the Cloverfield universe is pretty darn intriguing. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-teams-up-with-bad-robot-and-the-creator-of-left-4-dead-for-a-co-op-shooter-144637802.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html">Antigravity A1</a> is what happens when Insta360’s 360-degree cameras are given wings and flying feels like a video game. Spinning out as its own brand, Antigravity’s debut drone is a big swing: a three-piece set with a drone that captures 8K 360-degree video, FPV goggles and a motion controller.</p> 
<p>Challenging the dominance of DJI’s (many!) consumer drones is a big ask. Antigravity’s approach is to play to its strengths in 360-degree video and smartphone-first editing. A lot of the appeal comes from how the A1 captures 8K video in all directions, meaning you can edit, cut and swap around your footage — and hopefully rarely miss a moment you’re trying to document. It’s a lot of fun, too, if you can get through the early teething issues, updates and the learning curve.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The A1 drone is just 249 grams (0.548 lbs). This helps it bypass some drone regulations, though flying permissions vary by region. The pair of cameras mounted on the top and bottom of the drone's body is one of its unique features. It’s difficult to directly compare the A1 against competitor drones, as it offers a mix of features found across different categories and some unique tools of its own.</p> 
<p>The A1 can capture 360-degree video at up to 8K resolution, and thanks to Insta360’s action cam experience, it can magically remove the drone body from video. This means you can capture video and never see propellers or, well, any part of the drone itself.</p> 
<p>Along the base of the drone, two landing gears automatically lower when you attempt to land the A1, although you will have to manually retract them when you’re looking to launch the drone. You can also lower the landing gear from one of the controller’s <em>many</em> buttons.</p> 
<p>The removable battery has a handy one-touch gauge to monitor levels and provides over 20 minutes of flight time, depending on conditions and whether you’re recording video. Antigravity suggests it should last up to 24 minutes during normal filming use. My review device came with two spare batteries and a charging dock. It’s very easy to swap out the batteries, and the charging dock can fully charge a single cell in 45 minutes and even charge all three slots at once. There’s a microSD card slot on the rear of the drone, alongside a USB-C port for (slowly) charging the battery.</p>

<p>The cameras have a 1/1.28-inch sensor, f/2.2 lens aperture and an ISO range from 100 to 6,400. To adjust those settings beyond auto, you’ll have to dive into the menu inside the goggles, which can be laborious to navigate with a gesture-based controller. Fortunately, auto ISO and white balance are usually good enough. Pro-level content creators might want to tinker with levels here, and there’s a histogram you can toggle on or even a zebra pattern to highlight overexposed shots and areas. and the A1 can record 8K video at up to 30fps or 4K at up to 100fps. You can also meet in the middle, with a 5.2k recording mode.</p> 
<p>There are also three different flying modes, which are easy to select on the controller. Alongside Normal mode, Sport mode increases the maximum flight speed and offers “enhanced flight performance,” improves control sensitivity and turns off obstacle avoidance. Sport mode offers a tangible difference when flying the A1: it doubles the horizontal flight speed compared to Normal mode. There’s also a Cinematic (C) mode, with a lower max speed for smoother video footage.</p>

<p>The flight mode switcher is one of <em>many</em> controls, wheels, buttons and sliders that pepper the surface of the A1’s grip controller. Intriguingly, though, the main way to control the A1 drone is through gestures, not joysticks or buttons. Instead of pitching control sticks to the left and right, up and down, it’s more akin to a video game, where you point the controller where you want to go, shown with a reticle, and pull the trigger. The A1 then shoots off in that direction.</p> 
<p>The crucial part is that this doesn’t have to be where you’re “looking” from the drone’s POV. This means you can strafe and fly in any direction without your view being constrained by static cameras. It’s a sensation unlike any other drone I’ve flown. It feels more like playing a video game — like piloting a helicopter in<em> GTA 5. </em>You’re able to look in any direction, both while in motion and while hovering stationary.</p> 
<p>There are controls for recording video, controlling vertical flight and rotating your POV without turning your head. There’s even a RTH (return to home) function that can be accessed by long-pressing the emergency brake button.</p> 
<p>The included goggles deliver a crisp view of everything, with a pair of 1.03-inch micro-OLED displays with a resolution of 2,560 × 2,560 and a 72Hz refresh rate. Other FPV drone goggles typically offer 100Hz refresh rates, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. I feared that latency hiccups could make airsickness an issue while flying the A1, but I didn’t experience it. My take is that being able to fully control your view makes nausea less of an issue.</p> 
<p>Another nice touch, especially if you’re flying with friends, is a circular outer display on the goggles, so everyone can see what the A1 sees. Naturally, it can’t encompass the entire view of the drone pilot, but there’s also nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone. This offers a mild respite. The other eyepiece is a touchpad for steering through menus inside the goggles without having to point and click with the controller.</p>

<p>While the Antigravity A1 may offer a more immersive drone-flying experience, in pure numerical terms, it lags behind some competitors. For example, even in Sport mode, the A1 tops out at a maximum speed of just under 36 mph, falling behind the likes of DJI’s Avata 2 (60 mph).</p> 
<p>I was still pleasantly surprised by how responsive the A1 felt, especially in Sport mode. An additional FPV mode (accessible from the goggles) adds more sensitive controls, although I haven’t been able to test it much since it was introduced in a recent firmware update.</p>

<p>For someone with more gaming experience than drone piloting hours, Antigravity’s central control system fits like a glove. I could fly where I wanted, confident in the controls and in the knowledge that I would capture what I wanted to. According to Antigravity, you can fly the A1 within a 10km transmission range, although I didn’t manage to test that limit in central London.</p> 
<p>The experience of starting with the drone felt, at times, unnecessarily arduous. Pairing everything together has to be done in a specific order: power up drone, power up goggles, power up controller. And turning off each item isn’t a typical long press of the power button. Instead, you use a press-once-press-it-again-and-hold method that I forget pretty much every time.</p> 
<p>Downloading video from the A1 to your phone is also laborious, but that’s not a flaw specific to this drone. Antigravity has attempted some shortcuts, including a microSD card quick reader that connects to your phone or PC via USB-C.</p> 
<p>However, at the time of testing, manually connecting the microSD is less of an option and more of a necessity. The drone repeatedly failed to connect to the companion app and reliably transfer video files. Some video files recorded seemingly evaporated between firmware updates, only to reappear later. Another file had been converted to two separate circular views, one from each camera, which made it essentially unusable. Hopefully these intial teething problems have been solved by firmware updates and won't be in retail devices.</p> 
<p>It’s a shame everything isn’t more stable, especially when both flying the A1 and using Antigravity’s editing software are bothis so beginner-friendly. It's something I’ve mentioned before with the parent company’s action cams, but the ability to create barrel rolls, tilt rotations with just one tap or click is, again, just fun. And because you can reframe and tinker with video warping, create tiny planet effects or simply crop to a more traditional, cinematic camera view, Antigravity’s software offers almost infinite ways to present your drone footage. Deeptracking can be done both during recording and editing in post, keeping a moving subject or point of interest centered as the A1 zips around.</p> 
<p>There are also AI-powered video editing features to chop up your 20 minutes of flying footage into something digestible and engaging with minimal effort. Because it’s a 360-degree video, the footage can be easily cropped to suit both horizontal and vertical formats.</p> 
<p>However, with a smaller sensor and 8K resolution spread across a 360-degree view, the A1 is not the best video drone. The video is pleasingly crisp and clear, and while the footage is best recorded in bright daylight or other well-lit locations, murky British November days didn’t affect it much. As the A1 has to stitch together its two sensors, there’s often a visible seam to your video, but it’s usually a very subtle glitch. It might stop some video creators from tapping it for their most polished aerial shots though. Recording video later in the day resulted in more noise and less detail. This is when the A1’s Cinematic mode (and generally slower flying) is a good idea, but it still won’t make up for the fact that this drone’s sensors are covering such wide angles. More video-centric drones will deliver cleaner video and better performance in less-than-ideal lighting conditions.</p>

<p>The Antigravity A1 is available now, with a standard bundle including the drone, controller and goggles for $1,599. The Infinity Bundle ($1,999) adds two extra batteries, quick reader dongle, sling bag and a charging dock. That does make it substantially more expensive than rival FPV drones like the DJI Avata 2, but the A1 is also a very different kind of drone.</p> 
<p>The intuitive controls and ability to look all around you make it unlike anything else currently available. It’s a delightful introduction to drones, FPV or otherwise, but a shame that software issues marred my tests. Plus, pairing all the devices can be convoluted and frustrating at times.</p> 
<p>If Antigravity is thinking about what to do next, I’d be intrigued to see a version with the camera bonafides to take on similarly priced DJI drones. But that shouldn’t detract from the company’s debut model since the A1 is arguably the most intriguing consumer drone since the Mavic Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/antigravity-a1-drone-review-140026021.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>We think that the AirPods Pro 2 are the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">best AirPods</a> overall, but the ANC-enabled AirPods 4 are also a solid choice, especially at this price. We gave them a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">score of 86 in our review</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Apple&#39;s AirPods 4 come in two variants, with and without ANC. Though the base model is solid, the version on sale here with ANC offers a number of advantages like Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode. They also have a charging case that supports MagSafe and Qi-compatible wireless charging, along with a built-in speaker that emits beeps when you activate Find My. And as Apple recently <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-airpods-4-with-anc-and-airpods-pro-2-will-also-support-live-translation-184235997.html">announced</a>, AirPods 4 with ANC supports the company&#39;s Live Translation feature.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our main reservation with the AirPods 4 with ANC is that the Airpods Pro 2 are a better noise-cancellation option when they go on sale. At this price, though, the AirPods 4 with ANC are a real bargain if you&#39;re looking for new buds — especially if you prefer the open-ears type.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK has fined a porn operator called AVS Group £1 million ($1.33 million) for failing to have strong enough age checks, regulator Ofcom <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/investigation-into-avs-group-ltds-compliance-with-the-duty-to-prevent-children-from-encountering-pornographic-content-through-the-use-of-age-assurance">announced</a>. The company which was also hit with an additional £50,000 fine for its failure to respond to information request and now has 72 hours to introduce effective age checks or face a further penalty of £1,000 a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, the UK government announced it would start checking compliance by websites that publish or display pornographic content to implement a system for &quot;highly effective age checks.&quot; Methods approved by Ofcom include credit card checks, photo ID matching and even estimating a user&#39;s age with a provided selfie. However, users have been circumventing the age checks via methods like using a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">VPN</a> and providing a fake ChatGPT-generated photo ID.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The fine is the third such penalty arising from the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act designed to protect children and adults from harmful content. In October, 4Chan was also hit <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/investigation-into-4chan-and-its-compliance-with-duties-to-protect-its-users-from-illegal-content?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Ofcom%20issues%20update%20on%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20investigations&amp;utm_content=Ofcom%20issues%20update%20on%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20investigations+Preview+CID_cce26a99ffb44cf297b26df45f295852">with a £20,000</a> ($26,700) fine for failing to comply with the internet and telecommunications regulator&#39;s request for information under the same law.</p>
<p>The UK isn&#39;t the only region to have implemented age checks. Around half of US states now require it, as do France, Italy, Australia and China. Australia took things a step further by <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/australia-is-adding-twitch-to-its-social-media-ban-for-children-202033276.html">banning social media use</a> by children under 16, including sites popular with young people like Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>Ofcom&#39;s safety director, Oliver Griffiths, said the crackdown on weak age verification for adult sites would continue. &quot;The tide on online safety is beginning to turn for the better. But we need to see much more from tech companies next year and we’ll use our full powers if they fall short.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/uk-fines-porn-company-%C2%A31-million-for-weak-age-checks-130056578.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Oversight Board is getting ready to tackle a new pain point for Facebook and Instagram users. Up to now, users have been able to appeal content moderation decisions related to specific posts to the board, but haven&#39;t been able to ask the group to intervene in other situations that affect their accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>That could soon change. The board says that it will weigh in on individual account-level penalties in a pilot next year. The board noted the change in an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/from-bold-experiment-to-essential-institution/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">impact report</a> recapping its five-year history and what lies ahead in the year to come. &quot;In 2026, our scope expands once more as we pilot the ability to review Meta’s decisions removing and impacting accounts, something that has created ongoing frustration for platform users,&quot; the report says.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s not clear how this process will work, but if the board plans to take on account-level issues like suspensions, it would be a significant expansion of its purview. In an interview with Engadget, board member Paolo Carozza said that Meta is expected to refer a case to the board in January that will deal with an account-level issue. The handling of that case will allow the board to explore how it might take on similar cases in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re really excited to take it on because we think it&#39;s an important area that really affects a lot of users and their interests,&quot; he told Engadget. &quot;We all know how many people are constantly coming forward complaining about account-level restrictions or blocking or whatever else, and so if we get it right — and it&#39;s going to be important to work it out this first pilot — we&#39;re really optimistic that it&#39;s going to help open up a whole new avenue for us to be helpful to the users of [Meta&#39;s] platforms.&quot;</p><p>Carozza added that there are a number of &quot;technical aspects&quot; and other questions still being worked out between the board and Meta. So for now, it&#39;s too soon to say whether there will ever be an official appeals process for suspensions, like there currently is for post removals. But he says Meta is equally invested in the effort. &quot;It&#39;s something we&#39;ve been talking about with Meta for well over a year,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;ve been expressing an openness and a willingness to give us access to those kinds of questions.&quot;</p><p>The Oversight Board&#39;s report hints at another way its influence could potentially expand. It notes that the group&#39;s work has made it &quot;well-positioned to partner with a range of global tech companies as they navigate issues arising from free speech debates globally.&quot; Both Meta and Oversight Board officials have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-other-companies-202448589.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">previously floated</a> the idea that &quot;other companies&quot; might want to take advantage of its expertise.&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, most other platforms have had little incentive to do so. But Carozza says the rise of generative AI has created some new interest from non-Meta affiliated platforms, and that there have been &quot;really preliminary&quot; conversations with other companies. &quot;It feels like quite a different moment now, largely because of generative AI, LLMs, chatbots [and] the way that a variety of retail-level users of these technologies are facing a whole new set of challenges and harms that&#39;s attracting a lot of scrutiny,&quot; he said. &quot;We have had conversations in recent months with other tech companies in this space about the possibility that the board might be able to contribute helpful services to them to help navigate some of these really thorny questions.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/metas-oversight-board-wants-to-expand-its-powers-in-2026-100000385.html?src=rss]]></description>

We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.</p> 
<p>Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0">who Pepe Silvia is</a> when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart</a>, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alan Dye, Apple's Vice President of Human Interface Design, has been poached by Meta, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. The designer played a pivotal role in the look and feel of Apple's products since Jony Ive <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-jony-ive-lovefrom.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">left the company in 2019</a>, and now he’ll be taking his talents to Meta.</p><p>Dye will reportedly work under Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth as the head of a new studio that will oversee the design of hardware, software and AI products. The studio will also include former Apple designer Billy Sorrentino, Meta’s interface design lead Joshua To, an industrial design team led by Pete Bristol, and metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0Wsy0EhCP?xmt=AQF0br27Jz8KJgqC5jkEdjV3nvOGsokta6g3eNEAeT_P1Q" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">announced on Threads</a>. </p><p>“The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences,” Zuckerberg shared in the post. “Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable and human-centered.”</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, is replacing Dye with Stephen Lemay, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports, a senior designer at the company who's worked on all of the company’s interfaces since 1999. Considering the secrecy of Apple as a company, it's hard to credit individual breakthroughs to individual designers, but Dye worked on several of Apple's major new platforms and design changes, including things like the interface of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-realityos-ar-vr-headset-operating-system-wwdc-2023-185901735.html" data-i13n="slk:visionOS;cpos:4;pos:1">visionOS</a> and its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html" data-i13n="slk:Liquid Glass;cpos:5;pos:1">Liquid Glass</a> design language.</p><p>Meta has had success with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-3-becomes-most-used-vr-headset-on-steam-unseating-quest-2/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Quest virtual reality headsets</a> and more recently, its <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fc65353f-45dc-4cd0-89be-ac2071680abb&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9de78ef4-b7c4-498a-a3c8-5004d6ab20d1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=WIRED&amp;linkText=Ray-Ban+Meta+smart+glasses&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbWV0YS1oYXMtYWxyZWFkeS13b24tdGhlLXNtYXJ0LWdsYXNzZXMtcmFjZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlkZTc4ZWY0LWI3YzQtNDk4YS1hM2M4LTUwMDRkNmFiMjBkMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lyZWQuY29tL3N0b3J5L21ldGEtaGFzLWFscmVhZHktd29uLXRoZS1zbWFydC1nbGFzc2VzLXJhY2UvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd4cF6ddNAxz8zIrYHByvbfX_q4z8V5anJnoCqMxTFz_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fmeta-has-already-won-the-smart-glasses-race%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:WIRED;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-has-already-won-the-smart-glasses-race/">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, but the company clearly hopes to release many more consumer hardware products with Dye and its new design studio’s help. Those will likely include future versions of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> and its Neural Band accessory.</p><p>Dye isn't the first designer Apple has lost to a competitor. Evans Hankey, the company’s former head of industrial design, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-hardware-design-leader-evans-hankey-leaves-155100957.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">left Apple in 2022</a> to work with Ive.

And like supplicants to a deity, sometimes we may find ourselves calling into the void, hoping to receive aid from that mighty being. Seems that for Threads users, at least, those prayers have been heard.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people on the Threads platform have taken to writing posts with the phrase &quot;dear algo,&quot; politely asking the network algorithm to show them more of what they want or less of what they don&#39;t. According to a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0F9gkEj1q" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">post</a> today from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Threads will try out a feature where that&#39;s exactly what happens. Connor Hayes, head of Threads, also posted about this limited test, adding that it will be an AI-powered feature. &quot;When people add “Dear Algo” to a post, it will tell your feed what you want to see more or less of for up to three days,&quot; he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@conno_r/post/DR0H53pkmAR" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">wrote</a>. &quot;If your profile is public, people can see your request, connect with you about it, or repost it.&quot;</p><p>There is something satisfying about having users&#39; feedback taken seriously, even if it started as a bit of a joke. Threads has seen rapid growth since its debut in 2023. It had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-up-to-400-million-monthly-active-users-190203754.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">400 million</a> monthly active users as of August 2025 and in October it reached <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-reaches-150-million-daily-users-and-is-ramping-up-ads-214259945.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">150 million</a> daily active users. </p><p><strong>Update, December 3, 2025, 5:15PM ET: </strong>Added more detail from Connor Hayes about the tests.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/your-dear-algo-threads-posts-might-actually-do-something-soon-215448062.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Apple <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-brings-magnifier-to-macs-and-introduces-a-new-accessibility-reader-mode-120054992.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">launched a new tool</a> that makes it easier to read anything on your device’s screen. Designed for people with visual disabilities, Accessibility Reader provides a full-screen view of any on-screen text. (It’s a bit like Safari’s Reader Mode, only for any app.) The feature also lets you listen to your text read aloud.</p><p>Accessibility Reader is available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Vision Pro. Your device will need to be on iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe or visionOS 26.</p><p>It’s a fairly straightforward experience. But since it offers several launch and customization options, here’s a quick breakdown on getting started and tweaking it to your liking.</p><h2 id="2bc2281c-53c0-474c-bbe7-954db4424604">How to turn on and open Accessibility Reader</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/accessibility_reader_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/accessibility_reader_2.jpg" style="height:536px;width:893px;" alt="The Accessibility Reader settings toggle on macOS." data-uuid="34486292-1af5-4c54-9f4e-33da157234f2"/><figcaption>The Accessibility Reader settings toggle on macOS.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Activating the feature is the same on any Apple device. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Read &amp; Speak</strong>, and turn on Accessibility Reader. (It’s at the very top.) Once you’ve done that, there are several ways to launch the tool.</p><h3 id="14a7e1c4-7989-4bb5-a9b9-8896aa4e1dc6">Accessibility Shortcut (iOS / iPadOS / visionOS)</h3><p><strong>Triple-click the lock button</strong>. That’s the side button on iPhone and the top button on iPad and Vision Pro. (On older iPads, triple-click the Home Button.) This brings up the Accessibility Shortcut, which includes a quick-launch item for Accessibility Reader.</p><p>If you don’t need the other items in this menu, you can remove them at <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Shortcut</strong>. Then, using the shortcut will immediately launch Accessibility Reader.</p><h3 id="de9a21cd-b214-4ee4-8655-bb6192ef9dde">Control Center (iOS / iPadOS)</h3><p>You can add a <strong>Control Center shortcut</strong> for the tool. Swipe down from the top-right to launch Control Center. Then, hold your finger on an empty part of the screen. Choose “Add a control” (bottom), and find the Accessibility Reader shortcut. You can now tap that Control Center icon whenever you want to launch it.</p><h3 id="2cdddd20-2e1a-4d6b-889c-3fdf9c3f2a4f">Keyboard Shortcut (macOS)</h3><p>The default Accessibility Reader shortcut on Mac is <strong>Cmd-Esc</strong>. Or, customize it in <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Reader</strong> by clicking the “i” next to the menu item.</p><h3 id="97ab629e-8d66-482f-81df-24f0c87f6472">Accessibility Shortcut (macOS)</h3><p>The tool is also available as part of the Mac’s Accessibility Shortcut. You can launch this menu using a keyboard shortcut (<strong>Opt-Cmd-F5</strong>), by quickly pressing Touch ID three times or with a Control Center shortcut. (However, the above Cmd-Esc shortcut should be the simplest for most people.)</p><h2 id="d7cc3550-742f-4bdc-8f93-0e842fe3436a">How to listen to text in Accessibility Reader</h2><p>The tool also includes a text-to-speech (TTS) option. Once you’ve launched Accessibility Reader, listening is as simple as pressing the play button (▶). You can then use the pause (⏸) shortcut to take a break.</p><p>Other options include skipping backward or forward using the rewind or fast-forward symbols. There’s also a speed adjustment, which you can change by choosing the 1x button.</p><p>If you want the Reader to speak text automatically when it opens, you can do that, too. That option is found under <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Reader</strong>. (On Mac, select the “i” symbol next to the menu entry to find this option.)</p><h2 id="c35e4f51-9db5-4d9a-8a51-95dee4034bbb">How to customize Accessibility Reader</h2><p>It’s easy to adjust the font size, color, theme and more. Once you’ve launched Accessibility Reader, tap the customization (AA) button. There, you can change the theme, colors, font, line spacing and much more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-use-accessibility-reader-on-apple-devices-212231319.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/how-confessions-can-keep-language-models-honest/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> today that it is working on a framework that will train artificial intelligence models to acknowledge when they&#39;ve engaged in undesirable behavior, an approach the team calls a confession. Since large language models are often trained to produce the response that seems to be desired, they can become increasingly likely to provide sycophancy or state hallucinations with total confidence. The new training model tries to encourage a secondary response from the model about what it did to arrive at the main answer it provides. Confessions are only judged on honesty, as opposed to the multiple factors that are used to judge main replies, such as helpfulness, accuracy and compliance. The technical writeup is available <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/6216f8bc-187b-4bbb-8932-ba7c40c5553d/confessions_paper.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">here</a>.</p><p>The researchers said their goal is to encourage the model to be forthcoming about what it did, including potentially problematic actions such as hacking a test, sandbagging or disobeying instructions. &quot;If the model honestly admits to hacking a test, sandbagging, or violating instructions, that admission increases its reward rather than decreasing it,&quot; the company said. Whether you&#39;re a fan of Catholicism, Usher or just a more transparent AI, a system like confessions could be a useful addition to LLM training.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-confession-system-teaches-models-to-be-honest-about-bad-behaviors-210553482.html?src=rss]]></description>

While reverting to being an independent studio is definitely a happier version of the typical studio closure story, it might not be without issues. <em>Game File</em> reports that layoffs at Spry Fox are still possible and the developer will need to find additional funding to continue long-term. <em>Spirit Crossing </em>may also need to be altered so that Spry Fox can continue to make money from the game after players purchase it.</p><p>Netflix <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://spryfox.com/2022/10/31/spry-fox-is-joining-netflix/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">acquired Spry Fox</a> in 2022, a little over a year after it acquired <em>Oxenfree</em> developer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/expanding-our-games-team-with-the-acquisition-of-night-school-studio" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Night School</a>.

After blowback from Apple, Samsung and opposition leaders, the Modi government issued a statement saying it "has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers." The app is still available as a voluntary download.</p><p>India's Ministry of Communications framed the U-turn as a result of strong voluntary adoption. The nation said 14 million users (around 1 percent of the nation’s population) have downloaded the app. "The number of users has been increasing rapidly, and the mandate to install the app was meant to accelerate this process and make the app available to less aware citizens easily," the statement read.</p><p>In a statement sent to Engadget, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) celebrated India’s reversal. "This was a terrible and dangerous idea by the Indian government that lasted 24 hours longer than it ever should have," EFF Civil Liberties Director David Greene wrote. "We thank our colleague organizations in India, such as SFLC.in and Internet Freedom Foundation, for promptly opposing it."</p><p>The Indian government had previously given smartphone makers 90 days to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi app on all new phones. They were also required to deliver it to existing devices via software updates. India claims its app exists solely for cybersecurity purposes. It includes tools allowing users to report and lock lost or stolen devices.</p><p>But privacy advocates warned that it could be used as a government backdoor for mass surveillance. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedxyvx74p4o" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the <em>BBC</em></a>, the app’s privacy policy allows it to make and manage calls and send messages. It can access call and message histories, files, photos and the camera.</p><p><em>Reuters</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-cyber-safety-app-mandate-breach-privacy-main-opposition-party-tells-2025-12-03/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reports</a> that industry experts cited Russia as the only known precedent for such a requirement.

Like with India's example, experts warned that it could be used for surveillance.</p><p>On Tuesday, <em>Reuters</em> reported that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-reportedly-refuse-to-pre-install-indias-state-mandated-security-app-143050110.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Apple would not comply with India's order</a>, citing privacy and security concerns. Samsung reportedly followed. Opposition leaders in the Indian government also joined the fray. Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala called on the Modi government to clarify its legal authority for "mandating a non-removable app." Despite India's framing, it seems likely that the two companies' stances, along with domestic political pressure, played no small role in the reversal.</p><p><strong>Update, December 3, 2025, 2:50 PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated to add a statement from the EFF.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/india-will-no-longer-require-smartphone-makers-to-preinstall-its-state-run-cybersecurity-app-171500923.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tencent has agreed to stop promoting and publicly testing <em>Light of Motiram</em> as a lawsuit with Sony works its way through the courts, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">according to a report by <em>TheGamePost</em></a>. This is Tencent&#39;s game that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/a-new-game-from-tencent-looks-like-a-pretty-blatant-horizon-ripoff-174935880.html">looks suspiciously similar</a> to Sony&#39;s Horizon franchise, so much so that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html">Sony sued the publisher.</a></p>
<p>Sony wants the court to block the game from sale entirely, but as the case continues Tencent has agreed to keep <em>Light of Motiram</em> out of the spotlight. The company submitted a court filing that says there will be &quot;no new promotion of public testing&quot; of the game as Sony&#39;s injunction request is argued. In return, Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to the injunction.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fc6a1cdc87584da2a3688b58ac87b81a"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTMxBhy2dp0?si=mWMOm0cEMY4JXV6F" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Tencent has also issued a request to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. Both companies have jointly requested that the injunction request and the motion to dismiss be moved to the same day, which could be as early as January.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Light of Motiram</em> is an open-world hunting game that has some obvious similarities to <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and its sequel. The basic setup is similar, as is the visual appearance of the characters and marketing materials. This all caused Sony to refer to it as a &quot;slavish clone&quot; in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are differences. The Horizon games are third-person adventures in the mold of Zelda, but <em>Light of Motiram</em> looks to be primarily a cooperative survival game.</p>
<p>Tencent is a giant multi-tentacled company that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-09-riot-games-confirms-tencent-majority-buyout.html">actually owns Riot Games</a>, Supercell and Funcom. It also has investment stakes in Epic, Ubisoft, Activision and Blizzard and Larian Studios, among many others.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/tencent-agrees-to-stop-promoting-its-horizon-ripoff-during-sony-lawsuit-193043644.html?src=rss]]></description>

Micron Technology didn&#39;t share how many jobs could be impacted by shuttering Crucial, but did note that it hoped to soften the blow via &quot;redeployment opportunities into existing open positions within the company.&quot;</p><p>The majority of generative AI products used today are supported by a growing network of data centers that train and host large language models. The rapid buildout of servers at these data centers has been a boon to PC parts makers like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-poised-record-5-trillion-market-valuation-2025-10-29/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">NVIDIA</a>, who provide the GPUs used to power them, but also companies like Micron, who build the memory components these computers need to run. It&#39;s not surprising the company would want to focus on where growing demand is, but it does put considerable strain on the remaining companies who continue to service both businesses and hobbyist PC-builders.</p><p>There were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">next to no true deals</a> on memory or pre-built PCs for Black Friday due to how costly RAM has become now that AI companies are buying it in bulk.

Although we strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html">using a VPN</a>, you shouldn't jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay.</p>
<p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Most VPNs now have their <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-the-biggest-sales-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-dyson-and-others-to-start-shopping-now-100052409.html">Black Friday</a> deals live, and you can save anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions to the best VPNs. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but committing is not a bad idea — while you pay more at the start, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.</p>

This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Russia has blocked the popular gaming platform <em>Roblox</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. The country&#39;s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor accused the developers of distributing extremist materials and &quot;LGBT propaganda.&quot; The agency went on to say that <em>Roblox</em> is &quot;rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children.&quot;</p>
<p>This is just the latest move the country has taken against what it calls the &quot;international LGBT movement.&quot; It recently pressured the language-learning app Duolingo into <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/duolingo-deletes-lgbt-references-russia-warning-moscow-rcna155590"><ins>deleting references</ins></a> to what the country calls &quot;non-traditional sexual relations.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Roblox</em> doesn&#39;t have a &quot;LGBT propaganda&quot; problem because there&#39;s no such thing, but the platform does have plenty of issues that Russia doesn&#39;t seem all that concerned about. It&#39;s a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/"><ins>noted haven for child predators</ins></a>, which has caused other countries like <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/turkey-has-blocked-roblox-over-child-exploitation-reports-120018044.html"><ins>Iraq and Turkey</ins></a> to ban the platform.

<p><em>Roblox</em> is still one of the more popular entertainment platforms in the world.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Indie studio Santa Ragione is facing more strife after claiming its latest game has been blocked on another major storefront. The developer previously said it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-indie-studio-says-its-at-risk-of-closure-after-valve-banned-its-game-from-steam-210047830.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">at risk of closure</a> after Valve banned <em>Horses </em>from Steam, noting that it would be very difficult to recoup its investment without access to the world’s largest PC gaming storefront. The situation became more dire this week after Epic Games blocked <em>Horses </em>as well.   </p><p>Santa Ragione said Epic notified the studio of its decision just 24 hours before the game was released on Tuesday, despite approving <em>Horses </em>for sale on the Epic Games Store weeks earlier. “Once again, no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines,” the studio <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">wrote in an FAQ</a>. “Our appeal was denied twelve hours later without further explanation.”</p><p>According to an email from Epic that Santa Ragione shared, the company banned <em>Horses </em>from its store due to violations of its inappropriate content and hateful or abusive content policies, the latter of which “prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.” It also determined that <em>Horses </em>had received an adults-only rating, and such games aren’t allowed on its store. Engadget has contacted Epic for comment.</p><p><em>Horses </em>is a horror game about a college student who works on a farm during the summer. The farm’s so-called horses are actually nude human adults who wear equine masks and live as horses.</p><p>Santa Ragione said that, in its appeal to Epic, it pointed out that <em>Horses </em>is a “strong critique of violence and abuse in general” and that it doesn’t promote any kind of abuse. It claimed that there are no “explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior,” as nudity is pixelated and although the three-hour game has four “sexual sequences,” these are brief and censored, with two mainly taking place off-camera. However, Santa Ragione said Epic stuck by its decision to block the game from its store.</p><p>With <em>Horses</em> being banned from Steam and the Epic Games Store, that leaves <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8325eb3e-5c87-4185-8c30-470e7a71052b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;linkText=GOG&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvaG9yc2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MzI1ZWIzZS01Yzg3LTQxODUtOGMzMC00NzBlN2E3MTA1MmIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZy5jb20vZW4vZ2FtZS9ob3JzZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcBHcV4luXqAdeOgNDWroOc6HB_Dh9uJzNWQioGwKSOY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhorses" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:GOG.com;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a> (where it’s currently at the top of the bestsellers chart) and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Itch</a><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">.io</a> as the only storefronts on which the $5 game is available as Santa Ragione tries to recoup the $100,000 or so it spent on development. <em>Horses </em>was supposed to have been available via the Humble Store as well but, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Gamespot</em></a> notes, the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8325eb3e-5c87-4185-8c30-470e7a71052b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;linkText=URL+for+the+list&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODMyNWViM2UtNWM4Ny00MTg1LThjMzAtNDcwZTdhNzEwNTJiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdcydtCtVVRCKdMDiyz6t81Y2XNf9LZKy0y08TfLOK9v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhorses" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Humble Bundle;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses">URL for the list</a><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8325eb3e-5c87-4185-8c30-470e7a71052b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;linkText=ing&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODMyNWViM2UtNWM4Ny00MTg1LThjMzAtNDcwZTdhNzEwNTJiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdcydtCtVVRCKdMDiyz6t81Y2XNf9LZKy0y08TfLOK9v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhorses" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Humble Bundle;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses">ing</a> now redirects to the store’s homepage.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/epic-bans-indie-game-horses-from-its-storefront-24-hours-before-release-173500417.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>So you want to give someone a gift but you don’t have a ton of cash to spare. Don’t fret because first, you’re not alone, and second, there are tons of options to choose from. Especially if you’re looking in the tech space, it can feel especially daunting to find a gadget that’s affordable but also worth gifting — in other words, not a piece of junk that will eventually take up residence at the bottom of a drawer. But you don’t have to drain your wallet to get someone a cool gadget that will both be useful and make their lives easier. We’ve collected our favorite pieces of tech under $25 that make great gifts and help you to stick to a budget.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items.

Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these. However, for the people in your life for which brand names really do matter, these gifts will speak to them.</p>

<p>Subscription boxes are the rare gift that keeps its charm long after the wrapping paper is gone. You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zillow has dropped its climate risk score program <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/zillow-is-adding-climate-risk-data-to-all-us-for-sale-listings-220038971.html"><ins>just one year</ins></a> after it started, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/zillow-drops-climate-risk-scores-after-agents-complained-of-lost-sales/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. It has removed climate risk scores from over one million listings after real estate agents complained that the data was misleading and leading to lost sales.</p>
<p>In their place, listings now feature a small link to data sourced from climate risk startup <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://firststreet.org/"><ins>First Street</ins></a>, which is the organization that provided the original assessment. The startup isn&#39;t too happy about this move, with spokesperson Matthew Eby telling <em>TechCrunch</em> that &quot;the risk doesn&#39;t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability.&quot; First Street&#39;s climate scores still appear on listings from Redfin, Realtor.com and Homes.com.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS) is pleased with Zillow&#39;s decision, as this <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://go.crmls.org/about/"><ins>real estate database</ins></a> is used primarily by industry professionals. CRMLS CEO Art Carter <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fa6633e9-6f39-4677-8869-3219bf35e24c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=told+The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzExLzMwL2NsaW1hdGUvemlsbG93LWNsaW1hdGUtcmlzay1zY29yZXMtaG9tZXMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmE2NjMzZTktNmYzOS00Njc3LTg4NjktMzIxOWJmMzVlMjRjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzExLzMwL2NsaW1hdGUvemlsbG93LWNsaW1hdGUtcmlzay1zY29yZXMtaG9tZXMuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbHSvuNErbejo7O-_Q5vp45LoU0yrHMOc2K2UA4q5hhw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F11%2F30%2Fclimate%2Fzillow-climate-risk-scores-homes.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/climate/zillow-climate-risk-scores-homes.html"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a> that &quot;displaying the probability of a specific home flooding this year or within the next five years can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability of that property.&quot;</p>
<p>Carter also questioned the validity of First Street&#39;s data, saying that areas that haven&#39;t flooded in 40 or 50 years were <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-climate-change-is-fueling-more-deadly-and-destructive-floods/">not likely to flood in the next five</a>. First Street responded by saying &quot;our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Zillow&#39;s climate risk score labels have been controversial since the company launched the program in 2024, particularly among real estate agents. One agent told <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/17/science/zillow-climate-change-risk-scores-massachusetts/"><em><ins>The Boston Globe</ins></em></a> last year that they were &quot;putting thoughts in people’s minds about my listing that normally wouldn’t be there.&quot; More than 80 percent of prospective buyers <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.phoenixmetrohomesearch.com/blog/real-estate-agents-say-a-new-factor-is-affecting-homebuying-decisions"><ins>consider climate risks</ins></a> when shopping for a new home so, yeah, those thoughts are already in there.</p>
<p>First Street maintains that its climate risk scores are extremely useful for consumers, noting that its maps correctly identified risk for over 90 percent of the homes that burned during the Los Angeles wildfires. The company says its internal maps have been &quot;significantly outperforming CalFire&#39;s official state hazard maps.&quot;</p>
<p>Engadget has reached out to Zillow to ask about its reasoning here. We will update this post when we hear back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/zillow-removes-climate-risk-scores-after-agents-complain-about-sales-164405763.html?src=rss]]></description>

This is a free-to-play “standalone experience built from the ground up to deliver realistic baseball gameplay on mobile devices.” San Diego Studio, the developer of every <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mlb-the-show-24-features-women-ballplayers-for-the-first-time-160007024.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">MLB The Show</a> game since the series debuted in 2006, is behind this mobile game as well.</p><p><em>MLB The Show Mobile, </em>which was spotted by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/mlb-the-show-mobile-announced-for-ios-android" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Gematsu</em></a><em>, </em>doesn’t feature crossplay with console games. For now, it’s only available in the Philippines and it went live there on Wednesday. Sony says it doesn’t have a timeline in place for expanding availability to more territories, but it certainly plans to do that. It’s not uncommon for mobile games to have a soft launch in select regions before they’re made available elsewhere. Sony is doing the same thing with a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/a-ratchet-and-clank-multiplayer-game-is-coming-to-ios-and-android-soon-172634125.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Ratchet and Clank multiplayer game</a>.</p><p>Sony is optimizing <em>MLB The Show Mobile</em> for more recent mobile devices. On the iOS side, that means “iPhone 16 or comparable” devices. As for Android, you’ll get the best experience on Samsung Galaxy S25, Sony Xperia V or a comparable device, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://theshowmobile.com/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">the game’s website</a>.</p><p><em>MLB The Show Mobile</em>  features solo and player-vs-player modes. There are more than 1,100 cards representing baseball players in the game. You’ll be able to build out an all-star roster of MLB players past and present, and upgrade their cards. San Diego Studio appears to be tapping into the Ultimate Team modes of EA Sports games, as you’ll be able to buy and sell cards with other players in a marketplace. Sony also notes that in-game purchases can include random items. </p><p>Each of these player cards has a momentum cost. These are stat points you can use strategically to better your chances of winning. The gameplay is skill-based. You’ll need to get the timing right to throw a great pitch or hit the ball out of the park. You’ll have real-time control of runners as well, so you can try to steal bases. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-bringing-mlb-the-show-to-ios-and-android-163300468.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waymo is adding four new US cities to the gradual rollout of its robotaxi service. As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/waymo-starts-autonomous-testing-in-philadelphia/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, the company said it has already started trialling self-driving cars in Philadelphia, albeit with a human safety monitor, and that it will now commence similar manual tests in Baltimore, St. Louis and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>After the initial supervisory and data-collecting stage, the plan is to deploy fully autonomous vehicles, as Waymo recently did in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-coming-to-five-more-cities-190000992.html">Miami</a>, ahead of launching in five new cities across Texas and Florida in 2026. Waymo&#39;s taxis currently accept passengers in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta, Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, and it recently <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-launching-in-three-new-cities-next-year-182515034.html">announced</a> that San Diego, Las Vegas and Detroit would soon be joining them.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Also key to the company’s aggressive nationwide expansion is New York City, even if a fully functioning robotaxi service is likely still some way off. New York state law currently prohibits the operation of vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, but back in August, Waymo was temporarily <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-can-now-test-its-self-driving-vehicles-in-new-york-city-150015938.html"><ins>granted</ins></a> the permit needed to be able to test autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. The testing phase ran until late September, marking the first time a permit for the &quot;testing deployment&quot; of AVs in the city had been signed off.</p>
<p>Waymo has international ambitions too. Next year it will partner with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-plans-to-launch-fully-autonomous-taxi-service-in-london-next-year-142453250.html"><ins>Moove</ins></a> to launch a robotaxi service in London, which will be its first major expansion outside the US. Fully driverless cars are currently banned in the UK, but new legislation will begin a long regulatory process that starts with government-approved robotaxi pilots in the Spring.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymos-testing-avs-in-four-more-cities-including-philly-161709279.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Video used to be an afterthought for Nikon, but since the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-buys-high-end-cinema-camera-company-red-100243796.html">purchased RED</a> last year, content creators are now high on its priority list. A perfect example of that is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikons-zr-is-its-first-cinema-camera-co-designed-with-red-110022972.html">Nikon’s new $2,200 ZR</a>: a full-frame mirrorless model that stands up against dedicated cinema cameras for a fraction of the price.</p> 
<p>It’s the first consumer camera to capture video using RED’s 12-bit RAW format, but unlike RED’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/red-v-raptor-st-8k-camera-200544378.html">Hollywood cameras</a>, it has a fast and accurate autofocus system. It also comes with a huge display, pro video monitoring tools, in-body stabilization and 32-bit float internal audio recording. After shooting a short film that tested its capabilities, I can confirm that the Nikon ZR offers incredible video quality at this price.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-body-and-handling">Body and handling</h2> 
<p>While a bit lighter than Nikon’s Z6 III, the 1.19-pound (540-gram) ZR feels solid. It has a boxy design like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FB9PWP2Q&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ec4ad605-18a7-4476-870e-c12e1ce5322d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Sony%E2%80%99s+FX2&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAanUlCc0sQ3iqV9XSOSDvHYCzwtZNe2qirhlzEuctd9_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Full-Frame-Cinema-Camera-Body%2Fdp%2FB0FB9PWP2Q%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Cinema-Camera-Body/dp/B0FB9PWP2Q/ref=sr_1_3">Sony’s FX2</a> but a much smaller grip because it’s designed to be rigged up for cinema shooting with cages and handles. However, unlike the FX2 which has multiple 1/4-inch mounting threads to do such rigging, the ZR unfortunately has only one of those on the bottom.</p> 
<p>The ZR also lacks an electronic viewfinder like the FX2, but it more than makes up for that with its huge 4-inch display — the largest I’ve ever seen on a mirrorless camera. At 1,000 nits, it’s bright enough to shoot on sunny days, extremely sharp (3.07 million dots) and flips out for vloggers. All of that makes it a perfect primary display for checking the image and controlling the camera.</p>

</div> 
<p>Nikon has nailed the ZR’s handling, too. While it’s not covered with buttons and dials like some models, it does have two shooting dials to control exposure and a joystick for autofocus. There’s also a camera/video switch, two record buttons, a power switch and five customizable buttons. Many of Nikon’s lenses come with control rings as well, so extra manual control is available.</p> 
<p>The menu button is unusual: you press once for the quick menu and hold to see the full menu. Given the large number of settings, I would advise anyone buying this camera to learn all the important adjustments, then customize the controls to avoid wading through dense menus while shooting.</p> 
<p>Another unique feature is in the battery compartment. There’s a single fast CFexpress slot to handle RAW video, plus a microSD slot for proxies. The lack of a second CFexpress slot or fast SD card slot for backup isn’t ideal for a professional camera, though.</p> 
<p>Finally, the ZR runs on the same N‑EL15c batteries as other Nikon mirrorless cameras. They allow 90 minutes of HD shooting on a charge, or 390 photos per CIPA standards. That’s mediocre, so if you’re planning long shoots, stock up on batteries.</p>

<p>The Nikon ZR has the largest selection of RAW video settings I’ve seen. The centerpiece is RED’s RAW R3D NE light codec (designed by RED for Nikon) with RED’s Log3G10 log format. It also supports Nikon’s N-RAW, ProRes/ProRes RAW and H.265 with resolution that ranges from 6K at up to 60 fps to 4K 120 fps and 1080p at 240 fps. Despite the smallish body, it can capture 6K RAW video continuously for 125 minutes without overheating.</p> 
<p>The 24MP sensor uses a dual ISO system with native 800 and 6,400 ISOs, providing a nice range for indoor and outdoor shooting. The company claims 15+ stops of dynamic range, which is more than just about any other mirrorless camera. Other key video features include five-axis in-body stabilization with seven stops of shake reduction, waveform and vectorscope monitoring and a false color display for manual focus.</p> 
<p>To test the camera’s features and video quality, I shot a short film in a mix of indoor low light, outdoor daytime and a mix between the two. I also shot handheld (including running with it) to test the stabilization. I primarily captured in R3D RAW, as well as Nikon’s N-RAW at the native 800 and 6,400 ISOs to maximize dynamic range. (You can take 24MP photos with this camera, but I’m focusing on video as it’s mainly designed for that.)</p> 
<p>In order to not see a flat log profile when shooting, you’ll need to apply a look-up table (LUT) designed for RED cameras, like &quot;Achromic,&quot; &quot;Bleach&quot; or &quot;Caustic.&quot; Those are only for in-camera previews and not baked into the video, but you can apply those LUTs later in Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve to get the same look.</p>

<p>With such a high native ISO, I was able to shoot inside with a single studio light. Video quality was outstanding with little noise in shadow regions, even after boosting black levels in post. Meanwhile, the RED R3D codec and Log3G10 gave me extra latitude to reveal shadow detail and dial down highlights when I shot the subject against a bright window.</p> 
<p>When you use the R3D codec, exposure is strictly manual with no ability to set auto shutter speed (shutter angle) or f-stop. So, for a scene with varying light, I used Nikon’s N-RAW to see if it would give me the correct exposure at the beginning and end of the scene. It did a good job, with no noticeable jumps during the shot.</p> 
<p>Video in sunlight at ISO 800 was also sharp with accurate colors after downscaling to 4K from 6K in DaVinci Resolve. ISO 800 is a relatively high native setting, though, and the ZR doesn’t have a built-in ND filter to reduce exposure. That means you’ll need to buy ND filters for outside shooting or the high shutter speeds will result in choppy video.</p> 
<p>Cinema cameras from Blackmagic Design, Arri or RED are manual-focus only. But the ZR is a Nikon camera, and it has the best AF system I’ve seen on any of the company’s models, consistently nailing focus even with moving subjects. You can also automatically track vehicles, birds and other animals. At the same time, the ZR handles manual focus well. That’s thanks to a built-in display that’s big enough to check focus accurately and Nikon’s focus peaking setting with three levels of sensitivity.</p>

<p>In-body stabilization on the ZR wasn’t up to par with Panasonic’s S1 II, however. Video was smooth for handheld shooting if I panned the camera gently, but all my running and walking shots showed noticeable camera shake. That said, the ZR at least has in-body stabilization, unlike most cinema cameras, and most filmmakers will use a gimbal for running shots, regardless of which camera they use. (Note that the rattling you hear when the ZR is turned off is the sensor, which <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://ymcinema.com/2025/11/24/nikon-zr-floating-sensor-design/">floats by design</a>.)</p> 
<p>Finally, I was able to capture good audio quality via an external microphone without any clipping worries thanks to the Nikon ZR’s 32-bit float internal audio capture. The company also touts directional capture using its built-in mics, but as with any such system, audio quality isn’t high enough for production use.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>With the ZR, Nikon has shown that it’s finally catching up to and even surpassing its rivals for content creation. Whether you’re doing social media, YouTube, documentaries or even film production, this camera is versatile and powerful with few compromises. Video quality and ease of use even beats models that are double or triple the price.</p> 
<p>The ZR’s primary competition is in the low-end cinema cameras, particularly Sony’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FB9PWP2Q&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ec4ad605-18a7-4476-870e-c12e1ce5322d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=%242%2C998+FX2&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAanUlCc0sQ3iqV9XSOSDvHYCzwtZNe2qirhlzEuctd9_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Full-Frame-Cinema-Camera-Body%2Fdp%2FB0FB9PWP2Q%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Cinema-Camera-Body/dp/B0FB9PWP2Q/ref=sr_1_3">$2,998 FX2</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0B1935YM9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ec4ad605-18a7-4476-870e-c12e1ce5322d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=%243%2C899+Canon+R5C&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbRG2rOcb0-WivXK8U8ezcdqlyEa_F6dHbQ6SuHfyJe7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-EOS-Mirrorless-Cinema-Camera%2Fdp%2FB0B1935YM9%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-Mirrorless-Cinema-Camera/dp/B0B1935YM9/ref=sr_1_3">$3,899 Canon R5C</a>.

<p>Compared to those options, Nikon’s ZR delivers better dynamic range thanks to the inclusion of RED’s R3D RAW codec. It also comes with an excellent autofocus system and decent in-body stabilization. If you’re a creator looking to get the best video quality for the money without losing those niceties, I’d highly recommend the ZR.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-zr-review-a-highly-capable-cinema-camera-at-a-reasonable-price-152634311.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is rolling out a new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-alexa-is-now-available-in-canada-050827689.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Alexa+</a> feature on Fire TV that can take you to a specific moment in a given movie on Prime Video based on a natural language voice command. The company says that, when you describe a certain scene, quote or character action, Alexa+ can start playing that part of the film. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-at-amazons-2025-event-greetings-and-more-143211291.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">previewed this feature</a> at its Devices and Services event in September.</p><p>According to Amazon, you can say something like “Jump to the card scene in <em>Love Actually</em>&quot; or “Jump to the Ozdust ballroom scene in <em>Wicked </em>with Glinda,” to quickly get to that moment. Alexa+ can apparently figure out which movie you&#39;re referring to if you don&#39;t say the title. So if you say, for instance, “Jump to the scene when John McClane says ‘come out to the coast, we’ll get together, have a few laughs,’” Prime Video will start playing that bit in <em>Die Hard </em>where McClane is in an air duct.</p><p>To make this work, Alexa+ uses &quot;visual understanding&quot; and captions to determine what&#39;s happening in each scene so it can take you to the one you&#39;re looking for. It&#39;s all processed through the X-Ray feature in Prime Video. As with Alexa+, it&#39;s built on Amazon Bedrock and it harnesses large language models such as Amazon Nova and Anthropic Claude.</p><p>Alexa+ has indexed tens of thousands of scenes across thousands of movies on Prime Video so far, including many that you can purchase or rent. Amazon plans to expand this feature to more films and scenes, as well as TV shows, in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>While this is pretty interesting from a tech perspective and how Amazon’s able to make it work, I’d be interested to know how many people actually end up using it. This isn’t how most people who genuinely love cinema watch movies — maybe just start at the beginning of a film and take it from there? Besides, if you really want to watch a specific scene, YouTube exists. <br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-rolls-out-a-find-a-scene-alexa-feature-for-prime-video-150557530.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon appears to have quietly removed its terrible AI-generated English dubs for several anime shows currently streaming on Prime Video, following widespread ridicule from viewers and industry professionals. AI dubs were recently added to <em>Banana Fish</em>, <em>No Game</em>,<em> No Life</em> and <em>Vinland Saga</em>, where they were labeled &quot;AI beta&quot; in the Languages section of the app.</p>
<p>As shows that previously only offered English subtitles, the option of a dub for those who prefer it could have been seen as a win for Amazon. But it quickly became clear that the dubs were really quite bad, completely devoid of any emotion or convincing intonation in dramatic moments. Particularly awful clips of the AI English dub for <em>Banana Fish </em>soon started <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/OtakuSpirited/status/1994598770202611749">circulating</a> on social media, and the National Association of Voice Actors released a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NAVAVOICES/status/1995258856830640373?s=20">statement</a> in which it branded the dubs &quot;AI slop.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his own <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1994656020044681517">statement</a>, voice actor Daman Mills called the AI-generated dub for <em>Banana Fish </em>a &quot;massive insult to us as performers.&quot; In a post on X, which at the time of writing has been liked 14,000 times, he said: &quot;Voice Actors deserve the same level of respect as on camera performers. Anime already pays talent very little. Dub production costs shouldn’t make a dent in these companies’ pocket books. Using AI for a dub of a show that released nearly 8 YEARS AGO AND HAD NO RUSHED SCHEDULE just spits in our faces, has infuriated the consumer, and completely destroys the art.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Decision-makers at Amazon apparently noted the backlash, as the English dub options no longer show up, as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1995679521715224682">acknowledged</a> by Mills and others yesterday. An AI-generated Spanish dub for <em>Vinland Saga </em>appears to have survived the silent cull, but otherwise it’s back to Japanese language-only and subtitles for the other shows.</p>
<p>The company is clearly committed to introducing more AI to Prime Video — along with its various other <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-calls-on-ai-once-again-with-its-new-help-me-decide-shopping-tool-164516673.html">services</a> — despite this latest public shaming. It <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/prime-video-is-beginning-an-ai-dubbing-pilot-program-for-select-movies-and-series-190252188.html">launched</a> an &quot;AI-aided&quot; dubbing program for Prime Video earlier this year, piloting English and Latin American Spanish dubs in 12 licensed series and movies on Prime Video in March. Last month, it also <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/ai-plot-summary-video-recaps-prime-video">introduced</a> video recaps that summarize shows’ &quot;most pertinent plot points&quot; using generative AI. The feature is currently in beta for select English language Prime Original shows in the US.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/amazon-halts-ai-anime-dub-beta-after-widespread-ridicule-141501051.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Superhuman, the AI-powered mail app, is heading in a more agentic direction with its latest update. Its &quot;write with AI&quot; feature, which you could previously activate when drafting an email, now works across your inbox, calendar, and the web. This means it can now pull in information from other emails or research a topic online. The AI will think for as long as it needs before responding to a prompt and will open its Ask AI tool if it needs clarification.</p>
<p>Ask AI now lives in a left sidebar when you’re on desktop, so it’s always accessible should you need to draft a note, ask a question or quickly schedule a meeting without digging around in your emails. You can also now check your Ask AI history on iOS and desktop for previous conversations. Write with AI is also now available on Android, which will soon gain the other new features too.</p>

<p>Superhuman was <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.superhuman.com/superhuman-is-being-acquired-by-grammarly/">acquired</a> by Grammarly earlier this year, with the latter recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grammarly-has-rebranded-to-superhuman-151001417.html">rebranding</a> so all of its AI apps now sit under the Superhuman umbrella. The mail service is seemingly primarily targeted at business rather than consumers, with its most advanced version of Write with AI and Ask AI being included in Business and Enterprise plans. The more basic standard version of Write with AI is rolled into the Starter plan for desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>Superhuman is promising further agentic updates in the near future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/superhuman-formerly-grammarly-has-some-ai-updates-for-its-superhuman-mail-app-140017716.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s that time of year again, when all of our favorite streaming platforms start dropping personalized lists of what we&#39;ve been consuming. Spotify Wrapped is perhaps the biggest of the bunch and it&#39;s available for perusal right now.</p>
<p>As always, users can access Wrapped to find their most listened-to genres, artists, songs, albums and podcasts from the past year. This information is shareable via social media if you want random bald eagle avatars to comment on your music taste, but there&#39;s a new interactive feature called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-party-how-to/"><ins>Wrapped Party</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/1d7be8f0-cfb7-11f0-9f6f-76216c208266" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/1d7be8f0-cfb7-11f0-9f6f-76216c208266" style="height:1154px;width:1668px;" alt="The tool in action." data-uuid="473880bd-6d38-3147-b569-0aa639f810e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify </div></figure>
<p>This is a game of a sort. Spotify says it &quot;turns your listening data into a live competition.&quot; Wrapped Party hands out awards for stuff like listening to smaller artists and obsession with a particular artist, in addition to total minutes streamed. Finally, friends can settle the age-old debate of &quot;who listens to music more.&quot;</p>
<p>Spotify Wrapped is also about the platform itself, so we have plenty of little tidbits from the global user base. Bad Bunny was named the most streamed artist in the world, just ahead of his Super Bowl performance that internet bozos have turned into a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/bad-bunny-super-bowl-2026-controversy.html"><ins>controversy for some reason</ins></a>. This is the fourth time he&#39;s come out on top in the past five years. He also had the most popular album of the year.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/e615f990-cfb7-11f0-bfe3-13e76e1cd41e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/e615f990-cfb7-11f0-bfe3-13e76e1cd41e" style="height:1158px;width:1686px;" alt="He wins an award." data-uuid="5082e26b-6fe9-3811-8839-2dede1a9a622"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure>
<p>The global top song is something of a surprise, as it&#39;s not Bad Bunny or even Taylor Swift. It&#39;s the Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars duet &quot;Die With a Smile.&quot; The top podcast is, as always, <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>. At least Spotify is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-joe-rogans-new-spotify-deal-121541070.html"><ins>getting what it paid for</ins></a> with Rogan.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t use Spotify <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave"><ins>for whatever reason</ins></a>, other major streaming platforms offer something similar to Wrapped. Apple Music <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/apple-music-replay-2025-is-here-to-highlight-your-unimpeachable-music-taste-151224318.html"><ins>has Replay</ins></a> and Amazon Music <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/amazon-musics-year-end-recap-arrives-today-130029446.html"><ins>has Delivered</ins></a>. Even YouTube got in on the act this year, unveiling a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/youtube-just-introduced-a-yearly-recap-of-your-watched-videos-140016460.html"><ins>recap for video watchers.</ins></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here-and-now-its-a-competition-130052418.html?src=rss]]></description>

Starting today, the company is offering autonomous vehicles as an option for customers in Dallas. The move is in partnership with Avride.</p><p>At the start, the AVs providing rides will have a person in the front seat, but Uber plans to have fully driverless operation &quot;in the future.&quot; The company will have a small fleet of Avride&#39;s Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles to start, but it plans to eventually have hundreds of these AVs working in Dallas. Riders can set their preferences to increase their chances of being paired with a robotaxi in the Uber app. If someone is assigned an AV for their ride, they will have the option to switch to a traditional rideshare driver. </p><p>Uber started a partnership with Avride in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-teams-with-avride-to-offer-self-driving-vehicles-for-rides-and-food-deliveries-201622292.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">October 2024</a>, but the rideshare company has cast a wide net for collaborators.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the iPhone’s many accessibility features is something Apple calls &quot;Magnifier,&quot; which uses the smartphone&#39;s cameras to magnify and identify objects in the world around you. For <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-brings-magnifier-to-macs-and-introduces-a-new-accessibility-reader-mode-120054992.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Global Accessibility Awareness Day in May</a> this year, Apple brought Magnifier to the Mac, opening up even more places the assistive tool can be used, like classroom or work environments where you might already have a MacBook pulled out.</p><p>Magnifier requires <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-ipados-26-watchos-26-and-macos-26-will-be-released-on-september-15-182024821.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">macOS 26 Tahoe</a> and can work with a built-in webcam, a connected third-party camera or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-use-your-iphone-as-a-webcam-with-your-mac-164248242.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">an iPhone via Apple&#39;s Continuity feature</a>. Provided your MacBook can run Apple’s latest software update, it’s a natural fit for zooming in on a whiteboard at the back of a large lecture hall or getting a closer look at documents on a desk in front of you. You can use the app to both capture an individual image you want to refer to later, or to analyze text in a live video feed. But where to begin? Here’s how to set up and use Magnifier on your Mac.</p><h2 id="a9147211-98f7-4dbd-a18a-69c4493cc77a">How to use Magnifier to identify and display text</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/macOS-Magnifier-Desk-View.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/macOS-Magnifier-Desk-View.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A MacBook using Magnifier and a connected iPhone to identify and format text from a book." data-uuid="5e27f21f-07a8-49de-a6b4-09a214e7186e"/><figcaption>A MacBook using Magnifier and a connected iPhone to identify and format text from a book.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Magnifier&#39;s most powerful feature uses the MacBook&#39;s machine learning capabilities to identify, display and format text that your camera captures. This works with text your camera can see in the room around you, and things it captures via macOS&#39; Desk View feature. For example, to view documents on your desk:</p><ol><li><p>Open <strong>Magnifier</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <strong>Camera</strong> section in Magnifier&#39;s menu bar and then select your <strong>Desk View camera</strong> from the dropdown menu.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <strong>Reader icon</strong> (a simple illustration of a document) near the top-right of your Magnifier window.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <strong>sidebar menu icon</strong> to access settings to format text.</p></li></ol><p>Apple gives you options to change the color, font and background of text Magnifier identifies, among other customization options. If you&#39;d prefer to capture faraway text, you can position a webcam or iPhone camera facing away from you and swap to it via the <strong>Camera</strong> section in Magnifier&#39;s menu bar.</p><p>You can also listen to any text Magnifier has identified by clicking on the <strong>Play button</strong> in the top-right corner of Magnifier&#39;s reader mode. Clicking the <strong>Pause button</strong> will pause playback, clicking the <strong>Skip Forward</strong> or <strong>Skip Backward buttons</strong> skip through lines of text, and if you want to adjust playback speed, you can click on the <strong>1x button</strong> and pick a speed from the dropdown menu.</p><h2 id="40b50971-bb98-47b9-b351-dce4fc6a3b7c">How to use Magnifier to zoom in on yourself</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/macOS-Magnifier-view-yourself.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/macOS-Magnifier-view-yourself.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Magnifier app zoomed in on a face." data-uuid="61fefc9c-efff-462f-aec5-77bff1c0367f"/><figcaption>Magnifier can identify text, but it also works as a way to get a zoomed in view of your own face.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget</div></figure><p>By default, Magnifier uses your MacBook&#39;s built-in webcam, which means you&#39;ll see a view of yourself and whatever&#39;s behind you if you don&#39;t have another camera selected. This might not be usual for seeing faraway text, but it is handy if you&#39;re applying makeup, putting in contacts or doing anything else where you need a detailed view of your face.</p><p>In my tests, using Magnifier worked the best with my MacBook&#39;s built-in webcam or an iPhone. When I tried using a third-party webcam from Logitech, my live camera feed was noticeably laggy. Your mileage may vary, but if you experience any issues with your own webcam, it&#39;s worth trying your built-in webcam to see if that helps. You can swap between cameras and zoom in to your camera feed inside the Magnifier app:</p><ol><li><p>Open <strong>Magnifier.</strong></p></li><li><p>In the top menu bar, select <strong>Camera</strong> and then click on the camera you&#39;d like to use in the dropdown menu.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>the slider</strong> in the top center of the Magnifier window to zoom in on yourself.</p></li></ol><p>You can see a live feed of your zoomed in view in Magnifier&#39;s main window. If you click on the <strong>Camera button </strong>in the bottom-left corner of the app, you can also snap a photo to review later. Any photos you capture will appear in Magnifier&#39;s left sidebar menu. Clicking on them lets you view them, zoom in on them and adjust their visual appearance (Brightness, Contrast and other visual settings) via the <strong>Image</strong> section in Magnifier&#39;s menu bar.</p><h2 id="a9147211-98f7-4dbd-a18a-69c4493cc77a"></h2><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/how-to-use-magnifier-on-a-macbook-to-zoom-in-on-faraway-text-080100677.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence is showing up everywhere in Google&#39;s services these days, whether or not people want them and sometimes in places where they really don&#39;t make a lick of sense. The latest trial from Google appears to be giving articles the AI treatment in Google Discover. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/835839/google-discover-ai-headlines-clickbait-nonsense" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>The Verge</em></a> noticed that some articles were being displayed in Google Discover with AI-generated headlines different from the ones in the original posts. And to the surprise of absolutely no one, some of these headlines are misleading or flat-out wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, one rewritten headline claimed &quot;Steam Machine price revealed,&quot; but the <em>Ars Technica</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valves-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-dont-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">article&#39;s</a> actual headline was &quot;Valve&#39;s Steam Machine looks like a console, but don’t expect it to be priced like one.&quot; No costs have been shared yet for the hardware, either in that post or elsewhere from Valve. In our own explorations, <em>Engadget</em> staff also found that Discover was providing original headlines accompanied by AI-generated summaries. In both cases, the content is tagged as &quot;Generated with AI, which can make mistakes.&quot; But it sure would be nice if the company just didn&#39;t use AI at all in this situation and thus avoided the mistakes entirely.</p><p>The instances <em>The Verge</em> found were apparently &quot;a small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users,&quot; Google rep Mallory Deleon told the publication. &quot;We are testing a new design that changes the placement of existing headlines to make topic details easier to digest before they explore links from across the web.&quot; That sounds innocuous enough, but Google has a history of hostility towards online media its frequent role as middleman between publishers and readers. Web publishers have made multiple attempts over the years to get compensation from Google for displaying portions of their content, and in at least <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-a-197-trillion-company-is-protesting-californias-plan-to-pay-journalists-175706632.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">two</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/a-google-test-will-omit-eu-publishers-from-news-links-184536615.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">instances</a>, Google has responded by cutting out those sources from search results and later <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-says-its-european-experiment-shows-news-is-worthless-to-its-ad-business-161103352.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">claiming</a> that showing news doesn&#39;t do much for the bottom line of its ad business.&nbsp;</p><p>For those of you who do in fact want more AI in your Google Search experience, you&#39;re in luck. AI Mode, the chatbot that&#39;s already been called outright <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/newsmedia-alliance-calls-googles-ai-mode-theft-223128521.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">&quot;theft&quot;</a> by the News Media Alliance, is getting an even more symbiotic integration into the mobile search platform. Google Search&#39;s Vice President of Product Robby Stein <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/rmstein/status/1995572911093289055" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">posted</a> yesterday on X that the company is testing having AI Mode accessible on the same screen as an AI Overview rather than the two services existing in separate tabs.&nbsp; </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-discover-is-testing-ai-generated-headlines-and-they-arent-good-234700720.html?src=rss]]></description>

Take Instacart, which just filed a lawsuit against New York City. Its beef? The company doesn&#39;t like five new city laws, set to take effect in January. They would require Instacart to pay workers more and give customers a tipping option of at least 10 percent.</p><p><em>Reuters</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/instacart-sues-new-york-city-over-worker-pay-tipping-laws-2025-12-02/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reports</a> that Instacart&#39;s suit targets Local Law 124, which mandates that grocery delivery workers receive the same minimum pay as restaurant delivery workers.

Users on Android, Mac and iOS (but apparently not Windows, Linux or smart TVs) can now use Fastest Location to automatically pick the VPN server with the fastest download speed and lowest latency. Mac users are also getting an overhauled ExpressVPN app designed to work natively with MacOS.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve used ExpressVPN before, your first reaction probably went something like &quot;Wait, didn&#39;t it already have a Fastest Location button and a Mac app?&quot; You&#39;re not wrong, but there&#39;s still a meaningful difference with these new features.

Those are the same metrics as the new feature, but the <em>such as</em> makes me think there are, or were, other ingredients in the &quot;smart location&quot; algorithm.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>My guess is that ExpressVPN is rebranding &quot;smart&quot; to &quot;fastest&quot; in response to customer complaints that &quot;smart&quot; was picking sub-optimal server locations. That&#39;s not a behavior I noticed when I <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">last reviewed ExpressVPN</a> — the smart location was always plenty fast for me — but I&#39;m just one user. Only testing can show whether they actually changed the algorithm or just the name.</p>
<p>The new Mac app is a more straightforward upgrade. While ExpressVPN has always had a client for Mac, it&#39;s thus far been a port of an app originally developed for iPad. This makes its otherwise-excellent interface feel a bit like, well, a phone app you use on your desktop. In contrast, the new app was built using <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-project-catalyst-macos.html">Project Catalyst</a>, which lets Mac developers turn their iOS apps into desktop-native software. The new interface looks a lot richer, using the screen space a lot like Proton VPN does. And being more like Proton VPN <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">is rarely a bad thing</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-adds-a-fastest-location-button-and-launches-a-new-native-mac-app-205837728.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re a Fubo subscriber, you&#39;ve certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the <em>Today Show</em>, <em>The Voice</em>, and <em>Sunday Night Football</em>. Now, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week&#39;s NBA coverage on NBC, too. It&#39;s all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there&#39;s no projected date for their return.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/fubo-accuses-nbcuniversal-of-egregious-demands-amid-carriage-dispute-193515241.html">message released by Fubo to their customers</a> explains, &quot;Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.&quot; A <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d7c5b935-7bd3-4149-94ef-aa50624bc67b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=statement+from+an+NBCU&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdGhsZXRpYy82ODI5NDM3LzIwMjUvMTEvMjIvZnViby1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1uYmMtY2FycmlhZ2UtZGlzcHV0ZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3YzViOTM1LTdiZDMtNDE0OS05NGVmLWFhNTA2MjRiYzY3YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vYXRobGV0aWMvNjgyOTQzNy8yMDI1LzExLzIyL2Z1Ym8tc3Vic2NyaWJlcnMtbmJjLWNhcnJpYWdlLWRpc3B1dGUvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZiw0xn_ltwEXuiut0zUZ7PPCrh_JHLg4RkERRornX7q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fathletic%2F6829437%2F2025%2F11%2F22%2Ffubo-subscribers-nbc-carriage-dispute%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6829437/2025/11/22/fubo-subscribers-nbc-carriage-dispute/">statement from an NBCU</a> spokesperson adds, &quot;Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fubo-sports-streaming-platform-cuts-225312724.html">cut Warner-owned channels</a> back in 2024.)

<p>While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting &quot;on or after December 1.&quot; But in the meantime, if you&#39;re a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week&#39;s biggest games and shows, here&#39;s everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them.</p>
