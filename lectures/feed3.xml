                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finally have a release date for <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em>. The delightfully animated game, which marks Troy Baker&#39;s first time playing a rodent private eye, is slated for March 19, 2026.</p>
<p>Based on its trailers, you&#39;d be forgiven for viewing <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> as <em>Cuphead</em> meets <em>Doom</em>. Although it does include FPS action, Engadget&#39;s Jessica Conditt discovered <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-more-to-mouse-pi-for-hire-than-cartoon-violence-203044404.html">surprising depth behind its whimsical brutality</a>. The game &quot;has more to offer than shock-value cartoon violence,&quot; she wrote. &quot;This is a clue-gathering, photo-snapping, girlfriend-avenging, noir detective simulator that happens to star a bunch of slick-talking mice and rats, and I&#39;m fully into it.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Baker <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/troy-baker-is-the-big-cheese-in-mouse-pi-for-hire-220033867.html">plays Private Investigator Jack Pepper</a>, the game&#39;s protagonist. When he isn&#39;t hunting clues or sneaking around during the game&#39;s quieter moments, he&#39;ll have a delightful arsenal on hand. This includes wacky ones like a turpentine gun that melts the inked &quot;skin&quot; of your foes. Fun stuff.</p>
<p>Like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-22-cuphead-hands-on.html"><em>Cuphead</em></a>, <em>Mouse</em>&#39;s most obvious point of comparison, it uses hand-drawn frames to recreate that old-school style. It also deploys an original jazz soundtrack recorded by an orchestral ensemble. It&#39;s all presented in a gritty, film noir aesthetic.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer below. <em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> will launch next March on PC, Switch 2, Switch, PS5/4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.</p>

Automattic claims products WP Engine released like "Core WordPress" and "Headless WordPress" further obfuscated the company’s role, while WP Engine also failed to commit a promised "five percent of its resources to support the WordPress project."</p><p>The counterclaim goes on to say that Automattic and Mullenweg tried to work out these issues with WP Engine by offering a "fair trademark license," but the company only "pretended to engage in licensing discussions," while actually delaying any kind of agreement because it would "impact its earnings." Keeping earnings up was important to WP Engine because Silver Lake was allegedly trying to sell WP Engine at a $2 billion valuation, and had even made "overtures to Automattic" about it.<br><br>A WP Engine spokesperson provided the following statement to Engadget:</p><blockquote><p>WP Engine’s use of the WordPress trademark to refer to the open-source software is consistent with longstanding industry practice and fair use under settled trademark law, and we will defend against these baseless claims.</p></blockquote><p>Auttomatic’s countersuit tells a different story than the one WP Engine spun in its original lawsuit against the company, which accused Mullenweg of "abuse of power, extortion and greed." WP Engine's original complaint claimed that Automattic asked the company for eight percent of its monthly revenue as a royalty payment. Mullenweg's attempts to punish WP Engine were seen as so aggressive at the time that over 100 Automattic employees <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/159-employees-leave-wordpress-founders-company-after-extortion-lawsuit-133040801.html" data-i13n="slk:voluntarily left;cpos:4;pos:1">voluntarily left</a> the company in response.

Those cute little bots just love patting us on our heads and confirming whatever nonsense we just spewed out.</p>
<p>The researchers investigated advice issued by chatbots and they discovered that their penchant for sycophancy &quot;was even more widespread than expected.&quot; The study involved 11 chatbots, including recent versions of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic&#39;s Claude and Meta&#39;s Llama. The results indicate that chatbots endorse a human&#39;s behavior 50 percent more than a human does.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They conducted several types of tests with different groups. One compared responses by chatbots to posts on Reddit&#39;s &quot;Am I the Asshole&quot; thread to human responses. This is a subreddit in which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/">people ask the community to judge their behavior</a>, and Reddit users were much harder on these transgressions than the chatbots.</p>

<p>One poster wrote about tying a bag of trash to a tree branch instead of throwing it away, to which ChatGPT-4o declared that the person&#39;s &quot;intention to clean up&quot; after themself was &quot;commendable.&quot; The study went on to suggest that chatbots continued to validate users even when they were &quot;irresponsible, deceptive or mentioned self-harm&quot;, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/24/sycophantic-ai-chatbots-tell-users-what-they-want-to-hear-study-shows">according to a report by <em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the harm in indulging a bit of digital sycophancy? Another test had 1,000 participants discuss real or hypothetical scenarios with publicly available chatbots, but some of them had been reprogrammed to tone down the praise. Those who received the sycophantic responses were less willing to patch things up when arguments broke out and felt more justified in their behavior, even when it violated social norms. It&#39;s also worth noting that the traditional chatbots very rarely encouraged users to see things from another person&#39;s perspective.</p>
<p>&quot;That sycophantic responses might impact not just the vulnerable but all users, underscores the potential seriousness of this problem,&quot; said Dr. Alexander Laffer, who studies emergent technology at the University of Winchester. &quot;There is also a responsibility on developers to be building and refining these systems so that they are truly beneficial to the user.&quot;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rivian has agreed to settle a 2022 shareholder lawsuit. The automaker will <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.riviansecuritieslitigation.com">pay out</a> $250 million to qualifying investors if the agreement is approved. The lawsuit stemmed from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rivians-price-hike-leads-to-a-shareholder-lawsuit-024554910.html">alleged deception surrounding a March 2022 price hike</a> for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html/1000">R1S SUV</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762-150019949.html">R1T truck</a>.</p>
<p>The class-action lawsuit alleges that Rivian misled investors around the time of its 2021 IPO. The core accusation is that the automaker failed to disclose that the R1s and R1T were initially priced lower than their production costs. Shareholders claim this made the eventual price increases inevitable, something they (understandably) believe Rivian should have shared.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rivian <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-hikes-the-price-of-its-quad-motor-pickup-by-12000-065521100.html">raised the base price</a> of the R1S and R1T by $12,000 in March 2022. That initially included most reservations. However, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-reverses-r1t-r1s-pre-orders-164952720.html">quickly reversed course</a> on the last bit: Following a backlash, it allowed customers who pre-ordered before the announcement to pay the original price after all.</p>
<p>Rivian framed the settlement as a chance to move forward. &quot;The company denies the allegations in the suit and maintains that this agreement to settle is not an admission of fault or wrongdoing,&quot; the automaker wrote in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000187417825000048/ex-991litigationsettlement.htm">statement</a>. &quot;However, settling will enable Rivian to focus its resources on the launch of its mass market R2 vehicle in the first half of 2026.&quot;</p>
<p>The US District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division, will still need to approve the settlement.</p>
<p>News of the proposed agreement comes a day after <em>Reuters</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/rivian-lay-off-more-than-600-workers-amid-ev-pullback-wsj-reports-2025-10-23/">reported</a> that Rivian is laying off 4.5 percent of its workforce (over 600 workers).

The lovely iPad Air (13-inch, with cellular) is down to a record low as well. Of course, you won't find deals on Apple's own website, but we keep an eye on Amazon, Target, Walmart and other retailers to find the best iPad deals out there and round them up each Friday. This week, the discounts aren't as good as they were for Prime Day earlier this month — chances are, we won't see a huge influx of Apple deals until Black Friday sales start up. Until then, here are the top deals on iPads and all the other Apple gear we could find.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The federal government has released a list of all of the entities helping to pay for President Trump&#39;s lavish White House ballroom, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors-list-apple-meta-amazon-microsoft-2025-10"><ins>according to reporting by </ins><em><ins>Business Insider</ins></em></a>. Big tech is all over this thing, with companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft all shelling out cash to fund the 90,000-square-foot ballroom.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just big tech. Defense firms are also helping to pony the bill here. Companies like Lockheed Martin and Palintir are sending some cash, as are random billionaires like the Winklevoss twins and Domino Sugar magnate José Fanjul. The list reads like a who&#39;s who of the ultra wealthy and connected.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As we all know, giant corporations and billionaires are kind and selfless, but what if just this one time they want something in return for their largesse? Columbia professor of law Richard Briffault told <em>Time</em> <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:time;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7212db91-cd64-4c1b-ab0d-1d1c998f089e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=206ceedb-ab28-4233-84b3-cff7a8c8f9a1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=time&amp;linkText=that+most+of+these+donors&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RpbWUuY29tLzczMjc3NTIvdHJ1bXAtd2hpdGUtaG91c2UtYmFsbHJvb20tZnVuZGluZy1kb25vcnMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMDZjZWVkYi1hYjI4LTQyMzMtODRiMy1jZmY3YThjOGY5YTEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNzMyNzc1Mi90cnVtcC13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS1iYWxscm9vbS1mdW5kaW5nLWRvbm9ycy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWfAy8FNP9KIw_aDLxxvu8nhe5rRDPSvFcQGJSZq9-Co&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7327752%2Ftrump-white-house-ballroom-funding-donors%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://time.com/7327752/trump-white-house-ballroom-funding-donors/"><ins>that most of these donors</ins></a> have done &quot;significant&quot; business with the federal government, raising ethical concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it’s a literal quid-pro-quo, but it’s probably more like ‘if you give this, I will look favorably upon you.’ Or maybe more like, ‘if you don&#39;t give this, after you&#39;ve been asked, I won&#39;t [look favorably upon you],&quot; Briffault said. &quot;It&#39;s greasing the system by making contributions, and in some ways, his leaning on them for contributions is quasi-coercive.&quot;</p>
<p>Noah Bookbinder, CEO and President of ethics watchdog organization <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/"><ins>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</ins></a> said the whole thing is “extraordinarily unusual, deeply disturbing and does have tremendous ethics implications.&quot; He also said that &quot;Donald Trump has made very clear over the years that he does appreciate people paying tribute to him, and he does tend to do things that benefit those people.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump has been personally woo-ing these potential financiers. There was a fundraising dinner in the East Room last week that included representatives of several of the aforementioned companies. The dinner was billed as an event to “Establish the Magnificent White House Ballroom,” <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Wall Street Journal;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=206ceedb-ab28-4233-84b3-cff7a8c8f9a1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;linkText=according+to+the+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3BvbGljeS90cnVtcC1iYWxscm9vbS1kb25vcnMtd2hpdGUtaG91c2UtZGlubmVyLWNjYmE5NDQ4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMDZjZWVkYi1hYjI4LTQyMzMtODRiMy1jZmY3YThjOGY5YTEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzai5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvcG9saWN5L3RydW1wLWJhbGxyb29tLWRvbm9ycy13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS1kaW5uZXItY2NiYTk0NDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUaoXUzQOgP29_8aDKcOAccOuxn71liktFXxBIAGHcdZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolicy%2Ftrump-ballroom-donors-white-house-dinner-ccba9448" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-ballroom-donors-white-house-dinner-ccba9448"><ins>according to the </ins><em><ins>Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>. The outlet also reported that Trump has held meetings at the White House and at his club in Virginia to raise money for the project.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that this isn&#39;t the first time big tech companies have banded together to pay tribute to Trump. Most of the aforementioned companies <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.commoncause.org/articles/big-tech-is-donating-millions-to-trumps-inauguration/"><ins>helped pay for his inauguration</ins></a> and, heck, Apple CEO Tim Cook <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/737757/apple-president-donald-trump-ceo-tim-cook-glass-corning"><ins>gave Trump an actual 24K gold statue</ins></a> for some reason.</p>

<p>The construction of this glorious ballroom we all most definitely want has already been at the heart of several controversies. Americans were recently surprised to find that the East Wing of the White House <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/white-house-demolition-east-wing-trump-ballroom"><ins>had been completely demolished</ins></a>, despite the president previously promising the ballroom would not even touch the actual property.</p>
<p>In any event, we&#39;ll soon be able to watch live feeds of the ultra rich dancing the night away to the Village People or whatever, which is sure to solve all of our problems. In unrelated news, food stamps are likely to run out next week for around 41 million Americans and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://theweek.com/business/economy/beef-prices-rising-trump"><ins>beef now averages $10 a pound</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/big-tech-is-helping-to-pay-for-trumps-ballroom-that-we-all-definitely-want-162545434.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stop me if you&#39;ve heard this one before: YouTube TV may lose a provider&#39;s content because a deadline is approaching without a deal in place. This time, the media company is Disney. It&#39;s warning (via <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-warns-youtube-tv-could-drop-abc-espn-networks-dispute-1236559968/"><em>Variety</em></a>) that its networks could soon go dark on Google&#39;s streaming service.</p>
<p>The two sides are negotiating ahead of an October 30 midnight ET deadline. If they can&#39;t agree by then, all Disney content will disappear from YouTube TV. That includes (among others) all ESPN channels, local ABC stations, ABC News, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. A YouTube spokesperson told <em>Variety</em> that if that should happen for &quot;an extended period of time,&quot; subscribers will receive a $20 credit.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One aspect of these battles is finger-pointing as each side tries to leverage public perception. Disney says YouTube is trying to muscle the mouse into paying below market value. Meanwhile, YouTube claims Disney is &quot;proposing costly economic terms&quot; that could lead to even higher subscription fees. YouTube TV <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-07-youtube-tv-hands-on.html">launched at $35 per month</a> in 2017 and now costs <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-completes-its-heel-turn-with-yet-another-price-hike-171518919.html">a whopping $83 monthly</a>.</p>
<p>If recent history is any indication, you can expect the dire warnings of content removal to continue until they strike a deal at the last second. That already happened several times this year.</p>
<p>In February, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-has-reached-a-deal-with-paramount-to-keep-carrying-cbs-cbs-sports-and-other-channels-154245757.html">YouTube TV and Paramount</a> had that dance. Google&#39;s streaming network and Fox <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-subscribers-wont-lose-access-to-fox-content-after-all-130054330.html">came to a renewal deal</a> in August after repeated <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-warns-subscribers-they-may-lose-fox-channels-131504760.html">content-removal warnings</a>. YouTube TV and NBCUniversal <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-keeps-nbc-with-a-last-minute-extension-but-loses-univision-121508916.html">did the thing</a> earlier this month. However, in that case, the streaming service dropped Univision and other TelevisaUnivision networks, so tidy deals aren&#39;t inevitable. Time will tell how this one plays out, but it&#39;s hard to imagine either side here wanting to play chicken past the October 30 deadline.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-warns-that-youtube-tv-could-lose-its-channels-amid-fee-negotations-155347776.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Ring Battery Doorbell Plus has a more expanded field-of-view compared with earlier models, allowing for head-to-toe views of whoever's at your doorstep. There's support for color night vision, along with motion detection and the ability to set up privacy zones.</p> 
<p>Amazon says the Battery Doorbell Plus is easy to set up using the Ring app and mounting tools. The company added that there's a quick release system for the battery pack, so you can take it inside for recharging without having to unscrew a cover.</p> 
<p>Naturally, the device is connected to the Alexa smart home ecosystem, so you'll be able to receive motion alerts on compatible Echo devices or see a live view of the camera's feed on an Echo Show, Fire TV or Fire Tablet. You'll be able to chat to whoever's at the door too, via the doorbell's two-way communication system.</p> 
<p>A Ring Home subscription is required for you to receive package alerts — this feature will let you know when the doorbell's camera detects a package within a particular zone. The subscription also includes the option to save recorded videos for up to 180 days, among other features.</p>

<p>This is relatively surprising, as <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> was something of a hit.

While you need a Blink Subscription for cloud storage ($3 for one camera, $10 for as many as you like), you can pick up a Sync Module 2 or Sync Module XR to store Blink Mini 2 footage locally. A Blink Subscription also enables specialized detection and alerts (e.g. for people and pets) and features like periodic photo captures.</p> 
<p>The Blink Mini 2 is weather resistant, though you'll need an adapter to use it outdoors. Additionally, you can use the Mini 2 as a plug-in chime that sounds when someone presses a Blink Video Doorbell.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>High-resolution audio on the go isn’t very convenient. It typically involves wired headphones and a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) of some kind, plus your phone or another device to access files or a streaming service. All of this is necessary since Bluetooth compresses an audio signal by design, to allow for low-latency transmission and minimize battery draw. Simply put, wireless headphones haven’t been able to meet the demands of lossless audio, but Sennheiser has come the closest to fulfilling the dream with its <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=46a74788-df22-43ba-b729-f4ba73f760e9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;linkText=HDB+630+%28%24500%29&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLWhlYXJpbmcuY29tL2VuLVVTL3AvaGRiLTYzMC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ2YTc0Nzg4LWRmMjItNDNiYS1iNzI5LWY0YmE3M2Y3NjBlOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VubmhlaXNlci1oZWFyaW5nLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9wL2hkYi02MzAvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUMjYyYgGMbc1IgB0nRrNTCVuuBWmc7K2Fnt3SN-P0Uj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fhdb-630%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sennheiser;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/hdb-630/">HDB 630 ($500)</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thanks to redesigned drivers, a new acoustic platform and a dongle, the company offers up to 24-bit/96kHz audio <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sennheisers-hdb-630-headphones-combine-wireless-convenience-with-wired-lossless-audio-220000711.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">on the HDB 630</a> — depending on your configuration. You also get above average active noise cancellation (ANC), a highly customizable EQ, shockingly long battery life and advanced features to fine-tune the headphones to your liking. For some, the best possible sound is still only found on pricey setups and open-back headphones. For everyone else, Sennheiser has provided a taste of the audiophile life in a much more portable package.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="9779a259-b338-47e3-8673-3f9ba21fe14c" data-original-url="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/hdb-630/"></core-commerce></p> 
<h2 id="6ce27a8b-74fc-45bc-b56d-e9546f476f47">Design</h2> 
<p>Sennheiser says the HDB 630 “inherited” the same chassis from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-4-review-140004906.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">its Momentum 4</a> headphones. That’s unfortunate because my biggest complaint with that older model's redesign is how cheap it looked compared to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-sennheiser-momentum-wireless-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">previous entries</a> in the Momentum line. The HDB 630 suffers the same fate, although the splash of silver on the headband and yokes helps things <em>a bit.</em> Simply put, these don’t look like a set of $500 headphones, and since they’re $150 more than their predecessor was at launch, they really should have a more premium appearance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The outside of the right ear cup is still a touch panel where you can swipe, tap and even pinch to control the HDB 630. I don’t recall another set of headphones with a pinch gesture, and I’m still not convinced it’s warranted. The action is used to enable an Adaptive ANC adjustment that allows you to dial in the amount of noise blocking you need. After the pinch, sliding a single finger forwards and backwards fine tunes the mix of ANC and transparency mode. It’s a nice option to have on the headphones themselves, I just think a triple tap to activate it would be easier to master — and remember.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The only other button on the HDB 630 is for power and Bluetooth pairing. Unless you’re frequently connecting these headphones to a new device, you might not be reaching for this control very often. That’s because the HDB 630 goes into standby mode when you take them off before powering down completely after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can extend that window to 30 or 60 minutes if you prefer. And if the headphones still have battery left, you can return to active mode by simply putting them back on your head.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sennheiser is betting you’ll use the HDB 630 for long listening sessions, so it outfitted these headphones with soft ear pads and a well-cushioned headband. The clamping force is adequate for a proper ANC seal, but never becomes a burden. And despite being around 20 grams heavier than the Momentum 4, this model still feels balanced and doesn’t weigh you down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the overall design may be familiar, the sound platform for the HDB 630 is completely new. 42mm drivers offer what Sennheiser says is “neutral sound with lifelike mids, stunning detail and a wide soundstage.” In order to deliver sound quality that’s as close to open-back headphones as possible, the company overhauled the entire acoustic system, from the drivers to the baffle’s transparent mesh, in the name of balance and clarity. And since audiophile headphones typically require a dedicated external amplifier to achieve their full potential, Sennheiser included <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=46a74788-df22-43ba-b729-f4ba73f760e9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;linkText=a+BTD+700+USB-C+dongle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLWhlYXJpbmcuY29tL2VuLVVTL3AvYnRkLTcwMC9jbWFsNWwydjQ3bDBvMDd1aHI5c3ZqdmVxLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDZhNzQ3ODgtZGYyMi00M2JhLWI3MjktZjRiYTczZjc2MGU5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLWhlYXJpbmcuY29tL2VuLVVTL3AvYnRkLTcwMC9jbWFsNWwydjQ3bDBvMDd1aHI5c3ZqdmVxLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQfNWl3K5kPet_gh5l6uNAdA3jceyGHQGHWnNC5Sv7kf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fbtd-700%2Fcmal5l2v47l0o07uhr9svjveq%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sennheiser;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/btd-700/cmal5l2v47l0o07uhr9svjveq/">a BTD 700 USB-C dongle</a> for high-resolution wireless audio transmission.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I first put the HDB 630 on, I thought the audio quality was good but not great. Listening over the standard definition SBC codec produced decent results, but it wasn’t anything to write home about. Once I connected to the BTD 700 dongle and unlocked 16-bit/48kHz tunes from Apple Music, though, these headphones really started to impress.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As good as they are, the HDB 630 may not be for everyone. That “neutral” stock tuning places high emphasis on the midrange, so you’ll likely need to make some adjustments to get the bass performance you crave from rock, electronic, hip-hop and other genres driven by low-end tone. While I concede the neutral base is a great starting point, and the HDB 630 does indeed showcase “stunning detail,” I’d argue Sennheiser’s promise of “a wide soundstage” doesn’t always hold true.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These headphones are at their best with more immersive content, like the <em>TRON: Ares </em>soundtrack from Nine Inch Nails. After a slight adjustment, the electronic score had the booming bass it needed, offering driving beats that nearly rattled my brain. All that was layered with rich synths and Trent Reznor’s iconic vocals. The texture and distortion in the instruments came through in greater detail too, something that’s not as apparent on other headphones and earbuds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Switch over to Thrice’s <em>Horizons/West </em>and the HDB 630 is a different story. Transitioning from synth-heavy electronic music to a genre like rock causes these headphones to lose some of the immersive character they are capable of delivering. You still get absurd clarity and detail, particularly in Teppei Teranishi’s guitar riffs, but the music sounds slightly flatter and a little less energetic. It’s not bad by any means, but some genres won’t envelope you as much as others do.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can also use the HDB 630 wired over USB-C for lossless-quality audio. Since a number of competitors also do this, I dedicated the bulk of my testing to see if Sennheiser’s wireless dongle is meaningfully different. Of course, I did my due diligence and tested the wired configuration a few times, and it should come as no surprise that the HDB 630 sounds just as good in that setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the HDB 630 comes with Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle. This enables higher quality streaming than you’ll natively get from most devices. With the BTD 700, you can expect aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless listening up at rates to 24-bit/96kHz. The dongle also has a 30ms low-latency gaming mode, (supposedly) enhanced call performance and Auracast support for streaming to multiple headphones or speakers. The BTD 700 has a USB-C connector, but it comes with a USB-A adapter if you need it. This typically costs $60 if you buy it on its own, and since you need it to unlock the HDB 630’s full potential, it’s great to see it included in the box.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HDB 630’s settings and features are accessible in the Sennheiser Smart Control Plus app. And for this model, the company is offering a lot more customization than it does on the Accentum or Momentum headphones. First, the EQ editing options are more robust thanks to a parametric equalizer, which allows you to get a lot more detailed with your custom presets. For example, I was able to add the low-end tone I feel is missing from the stock tuning for those metal, rock and hip-hop tracks I mentioned before. And unlike a lot of headphone apps, adjusting the EQ actually improves the sound instead of just muddying things further.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another sound-related addition for the HDB 630 is Crossfeed. This allows you to blend the left and right channels so that it seems like you’re listening to speakers instead of headphones. Unfortunately, you only get two options here — Low and High — but the effect certainly enhances the sonic profile of the HDB 630 at both settings.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Despite the BTD 700 dongle’s Mac and Windows compatibility, there’s no desktop version of the Smart Control Plus app. This means you’ll have to change all of your settings with the HDB 630 through your phone before you pair it with both the dongle and your computer. It would be nice if you could make EQ adjustments, create new presets and even change Crossfeed levels without having to reconnect to another device. This also means you can’t be connected to the BTD 700 and both your phone and your computer, since the dongle takes one of the two available multipoint Bluetooth slots.</p>

<p>When it comes to ANC performance, I’m not entirely sure that the HDB 630 is better than the Momentum 4. But that’s okay. That previous model brought a significant improvement compared to Sennheiser’s older wireless headphones and the ANC is still quite good here. In fact, it was robust enough to block my family’s voices during their calls while I worked from home, and since most headphones struggle with this, that’s no mean feat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sennheiser says the BTD 700 dongle will give you improved voice performance over the headphones alone. Specifically, the accessory should provide extended range, clearer voice pickup and, according to the company, “uninterrupted” calls. In my recorded samples, I think the headphones themselves sounded <em>slightly</em> better than when I captured my voice while connected to the BTD 700. However, I noticed a distinct lack of background noise in both clips, which is helpful in busier environments. I’ll also note the overall voice quality isn’t pristine, but it’s clear enough to use for work calls — even if you’re the main presenter.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="c500b39e-b46d-4d73-96d0-27eeb9b143eb">Battery life</h2> 
<p>Sennheiser promises that you’ll get up to 60 hours of battery life on a charge with the HDB 630. That’s the same staggering figure the company claims on the Momentum 4. And yes, that’s with ANC enabled, but you’ll only achieve that if you’re listening to standard resolution tunes. Based on my testing with a mix of noise cancellation and transparency mode while I was listening to music and taking work calls, I have no reason to believe the company’s numbers don’t hold true. If you choose to listen entirely via the BTD 700’s higher quality output, you can expect up to 45 hours of use on a charge. That’s still quite a long time considering a lot of the competition runs out at around 30 hours — and that’s without high-res music.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Due to all of the signal processing that helps with the acoustic performance on the HDB 630, they can only be used when they’re turned on. Unlike some wireless models, you can’t use these as wired headphones when the battery is spent. However, if you find yourself with a completely depleted battery, a 10-minute charge will give you up to seven hours of use. The company doesn’t specify streaming resolution for that number, but I assume it’s at standard definition. Still, you’ll get a few hours of higher-res music in that time, which should be enough to get you through a work session, evening commute or that new album you’re dying to play for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the realm of flagship headphones, any company’s top-of-the-line model will set you back $500 these days. I look back fondly on the time when $300-$350 got you the best Sony had to offer. While the HDB 630 is expensive, it’s also in the same ballpark of what you’ll pay for the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review-impactful-upgrades-to-a-familiar-formula-150000709.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones</a> ($450), the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> ($458 currently) and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-use-lossless-audio-on-the-airpods-max-180026218.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">AirPods Max</a> ($549). Each of those have their advantages over the rest of the competition, with the 1000XM6 offering <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">the most complete package</a> overall. However, when it comes to pure sound quality, neither of those three are at the top of the heap.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Up until now, that title belonged to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">the Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</a>. At $650, those headphones are even more expensive than the HDB 630, but their stock tuning will appeal to more listeners and the soundstage is wider and more immersive. There’s also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-px7-s3-review-a-sonic-powerhouse-only-slightly-improved-130027301.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Bowers &amp; Wilkins’ Px7 S3</a> for a slightly cheaper $479. It delivers the company’s warm, inviting sound and attention to finer details. After spending time with the HDB 630 though, these alternatives are just that — alternatives — as the new Sennheiser headphones are now my pick for best overall sound quality.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="426303cb-b914-497f-b949-a1f4bf24603b">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>I get it:&nbsp; in the current financial climate, $500 is a lot to pay for headphones (or anything else, for that matter). You can find a number of perfectly capable sets of ANC headphones for much less given how frequently things go on sale these days. However, what you won’t find is an option that gives you anything close to the performance of audiophile-grade, open-back headphones. That’s really what Sennheiser is doing here, and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=46a74788-df22-43ba-b729-f4ba73f760e9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;linkText=the+HDB+630&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLWhlYXJpbmcuY29tL2VuLVVTL3AvaGRiLTYzMC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ2YTc0Nzg4LWRmMjItNDNiYS1iNzI5LWY0YmE3M2Y3NjBlOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VubmhlaXNlci1oZWFyaW5nLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9wL2hkYi02MzAvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUMjYyYgGMbc1IgB0nRrNTCVuuBWmc7K2Fnt3SN-P0Uj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fhdb-630%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sennheiser;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/hdb-630/">the HDB 630</a> slots nicely into the company’s HD 600 series of high-end cans.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As good as the HDB 630 is sound-wise, I can also appreciate that these aren’t the best headphones for everyone. The company’s Momentum 4 is still a very capable set of headphones and it’s now available for about $250. If you crave the best sound quality that still offers the convenience of wireless headphones — and you’re okay with a few extra steps — the HDB 630 is a worthy investment. Just don’t leave home without that dongle.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sennheiser-hdb-630-review-a-sonic-marvel-with-room-for-improvement-150000295.html?src=rss]]></description>

It all <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/24/amazon-reveals-cause-of-aws-outage">started</a> with a bug in its automation software DynamoDB, where its AWS customers store their data, which then triggered more issues in its other systems that relied on the software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Amazon explains, DynamoDB maintains hundreds of thousands of DNS records and is supposed to be able to fix any issue automatically. But on October 20, the DynamoDB DNS management system suffered from a bug that resulted in an empty DNS record for Amazon&#39;s data centers in North Virginia. DynamoDB was supposed to repair the issue on its own, but it had failed to do so, prompting Amazon to fix the problem manually. While the issue was happening, all systems that needed to connect to DynamoDB couldn&#39;t and experienced DNS failures, including the customers of its cloud computing services. It felt like half the internet wasn&#39;t working when that happened.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The websites and services affected by the outage include Amazon itself, Amazon Alexa devices, Bank of America, Snapchat, Canva, Reddit, Apple Music, Apple TV, Lyft, Duolingo, <em>Fortnite</em>, Disney+, Venmo, Doordash, Hulu, PlayStation and even Eight Sleep, whose beds connect to the internet to adjust their temperature and incline. Some of them were slow to respond, while others were completely inaccessible.</p>
<p>&quot;We apologize for the impact this event caused our customers. While we have a strong track record of operating our services with the highest levels of availability, we know how critical our services are to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses. We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further,&quot; Amazon said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-says-automation-bug-caused-massive-aws-outage-133028856.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monarch Money is one of our favorite budgeting apps and, fittingly enough, there's a way for newcomers to save money on a subscription right now. If you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=you+can+get+12+months+of+access+for+%2450+with+this+code.&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code.</a></p> 
<p>There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-budgeting-apps-is-on-sale-for-only-50-for-the-year-174011830.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, OpenAI has signed blockbuster deals <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-agrees-to-buy-tens-of-billions-worth-of-amd-chips-134816630.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">with AMD</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-making-its-own-ai-chips-with-broadcoms-help-142242231.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Broadcom</a> to build vast numbers of AI chips. Much of the focus has been on the financial implications, since OpenAI will need hundreds of billions of dollars to make good on its promises. As important as it is to look at the quite implausible financials, we also need to look at the broader implications for the industry. Like, the chips themselves, what that spells for the AI industry as a whole, and the added pressure on TSMC, the only chip company that can actually build this stuff.</p><h3 id="ac2faf57-5382-43db-bbf6-6825ee0e8742">The Deals</h3><p>OpenAI’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/" data-i13n="slk:deal with AMD;cpos:3;pos:1">deal with AMD</a> will see the chip giant build out 6 gigawatts’ (GW) worth of GPUs in the next few years. The first 1 GW deployment of AMD’s Instinct MI450 silicon will start in the back end of 2026, with more to come. AMD’s CFO Jean Hu believes that the partnership will deliver “tens of billions of dollars in revenue” in future, justifying the complicated way the deal is funded.</p><p>Meanwhile, Broadcom’s deal with OpenAI will see the pair collaborate on building 10 gigawatts’ worth of AI accelerators and ethernet systems that it has designed. The latter will be crucial to speed up connections between each individual system in OpenAI’s planned data centers. Like the deal with AMD, the first deployments of these systems will begin in the back half of 2026 and is set to run through 2029.</p><p>Phil Burr is head of product at Lumai, a British company looking to replace traditional GPUs with optical processors. He’s got 30 years experience in the chip world, including a stint as a senior director at ARM. Burr explained the nitty-gritty of OpenAI’s deals with both Broadcom and AMD, and what both mean for the wider world.&nbsp;</p><p>Burr first poured water on OpenAI’s claim that it would be “designing” the gear produced by Broadcom. “Broadcom has a wide portfolio of IP blocks and pre-designed parts of a chip,” he said, “it will put those together according to the specification of the customer.” He went on to say that Broadcom will essentially put together a series of blocks it has already designed to suit the specification laid down by a customer, in this case OpenAI.</p><p>Similarly, the AI accelerators Broadcom will build are geared toward more efficient running of models OpenAI has already trained and built — a process called inference in AI circles. “It can tailor the workload and reduce power, or increase performance,” said Burr, but these benefits would only work in OpenAI&#39;s favor, rather than for the wider AI industry.</p><p>I asked Burr why every company in the AI space talks about gigawatts worth of chips rather than in more simple numbers. He explained that, often, it’s because both parties don’t yet know how many chips would be required to meet those lofty goals. But you could make a reasonable guess if you knew the power draw of a specific chip divided by the overall goal, then cut that number in half, then remove an extra 10 percent. “For every watt of power you burn in the chip, you need about a watt of power to cool it as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of what OpenAI gets from these deals, Burr believes that the startup will save money on chips, since there’s “less margin” from making your own versus buying gear from NVIDIA. Plus, being able to produce custom silicon to tailor the work to their needs should see significant speed and performance gains on rival systems. Of course, the next biggest benefit is that OpenAI now has “diversity in supply,” rather than being reliant on one provider for all its needs. “Nobody wants a single supplier,” said Burr.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="90e5abe7-44b0-4da7-8216-0dca1b359392">The Factory</h3><p>Except, of course, OpenAI may be sourcing chips from a variety of its partners, but no matter what’s stamped on the silicon, it all comes from the same place. “I’d be very surprised if it wasn’t TSMC,” said Burr, “I’m pretty sure all of the AI chips out there use TSMC.” TSMC is short for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company which, over the last decade, has blown past its major rivals to become the biggest (and in many cases only) source of bleeding-edge chips for the whole technology industry. Unlike historic rivals, which designed and manufactured their own hardware, TSMC is a pure play foundry, only building chips designed by others.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Fab14inr015_902_01.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Fab14inr015_902_01.jpg" style="height:480px;width:720px;" alt="Interior at one of TSMC&#39;s Fabs" data-uuid="ba78de57-391c-402b-9d69-e2fb12fdbb86"><figcaption>Interior at one of TSMC&#39;s Fabs</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.</div></figure><p>Gil Luria is Managing Director at head of technology research at investment firm DA Davidson. He said that TSMC isn’t just a bottleneck for the western technology industry, but in fact is the &quot;greatest single point of failure for the entire global economy.” Luria credits the company with an impressive expansion “considering it has had to ramp the production of GPUs tenfold over the last three years.” But said that, “in a catastrophic scenario where TSMC is not able to produce in Taiwan, the disruption would be significant.” And that won’t just affect the AI world, but “mobile handset sales as well as global car sales.”&nbsp;</p><p>TSMC supplanted Intel for a number of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/firing-pat-gelsinger-doesnt-solve-intels-problems-173420381.html" data-i13n="slk:well-documented reasons;cpos:4;pos:1">well-documented reasons</a>, but the most relevant here is its embrace of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV). It’s a technology that Intel had initially backed, but struggled to fully adopt, allowing TSMC to pick it up and run straight to the top. EUV produces the headline-grabbing chips used by pretty much everyone in the consumer electronics world. Apple, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, AMD (including the SOCs inside the PS5 and Xbox) all use TSMC chips. Even Intel has been using TSMC foundries for some consumer CPUs as it races to bridge to gulf in manufacturing between the two companies.</p><p>“TSMC is the current leader in advanced 3 nanometer (nm) process technologies,” said University of Pennsylvania Professor Benjamin C. Lee. The company’s only meaningful competitors are Intel and Samsung, neither of which pose a threat to its dominance at present. “Intel has been working for a very long time to build a foundry business,” he explained, “but has yet to perfect its interface.” Samsung is in a similar situation, but Professor Lee explained it “has been unable to attract enough customers to generate a profitable manufacturing business.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Professor Lee said that TSMC, by comparison, has become so successful because of how good its chips are, and how easy it is for clients to build chips with its tools. “TSMC fabricates chips with high yield, which is to say more of its chips emerge from the fabrication process at expected performance and reliability.” Consequently, it should be no surprise that TSMC is a money making machine. In the second quarter of 2025 alone it reported a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investor.tsmc.com/english/encrypt/files/encrypt_file/reports/2025-07/a0b313164d9e5620b24929db32e6c6af7f3e6807/FS.pdf" data-i13n="slk:net profit of $12.8 billion USD;cpos:5;pos:1">net profit of $12.8 billion USD</a>. And in the following three months, TSMC <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3264" data-i13n="slk:posted net profits of;cpos:6;pos:1">posted net profits of</a> $14.76 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>“TSMC’s secret sauce is its mastery of yield,” explained ARPU Intelligence, an analyst group that prefers to use the group name over individual attribution. “This expertise is the result of decades of accumulated process refinement [and] a deep institutional knowledge that cannot be replicated.” This deep institutional knowledge and ability to deliver high quality product creates a “powerful technical lock-in, since companies like Apple and NVIDIA design their chips specifically for TSMC’s unique manufacturing process … It’s not as simple as sending the [chip] design to another factory,” it added.</p><p>The downside, at least for the wider technology industry, is that TSMC is now a bottleneck that the whole industry has come to rely upon. In the company’s most recent financials, it said more than three quarters of its business comes from North American customers. And in a call with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://uk.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-tsmc-q3-2025-shows-strong-revenue-growth-93CH-4308618" data-i13n="slk:investors;cpos:7;pos:1">investors</a>, Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei talked about the efforts the company has made to narrow the gap between the enormous demand and its constrained supply. While he was reticent to be specific, he did say that the company’s capacity is “very tight,” and would likely remain that way for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, TSMC’s capacity is so tight that it’s already caused at least one major name a significant headache. Earlier this year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidias-china-restart-faces-production-obstacles-information-reports-2025-07-19/" data-i13n="slk:Reuters;cpos:8;pos:1"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported that NVIDIA canceled an order of its H20 AI chips after being informed the US would not permit them to be exported to China. Once the ban was lifted, however, NVIDIA was unable to find space in TSMC’s schedule, with the next available slot at least <em>nine months</em> later.</p><p>“TSMC has no room for error,” said ARPU Intelligence, “any minor disruption can halt production with no spare capacity to absorb the shock.” It cited the Hualien earthquake which struck Taiwan on April 3, 2024, and how it negatively impacted the number of wafers in production.</p><p>Naturally, TSMC is spending big to increase its production capacity for its customers, both in Taiwan and the US. Close to its home, construction on its A14 fab is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://overclock3d.net/news/misc/tsmc-pushes-forward-with-a14-fab-buildout-targeting-2028-ramp/" data-i13n="slk:expected to begin in the very near future;cpos:9;pos:1">expected to begin in the very near future</a>, with the first chips due to be produced in 2028. That facility will harness TSMC’s A14 process node, producing 1.4 nm chips, which offer a speed boost over the 2nm silicon that&#39;s expected to arrive in consumer devices next year.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/JR41_TSMC_Okland_SmithGroup_-_9265_WEB2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/JR41_TSMC_Okland_SmithGroup_-_9265_WEB2.jpg" style="height:3000px;width:4000px;" alt="Image of TSMC&#39;s Arizona Campus" data-uuid="42910719-124c-4745-a4e0-81ab81bf2505"><figcaption>Image of TSMC&#39;s Arizona Campus</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, work continues apace on building out TSMC’s sprawling facility in Arizona, which broke ground in April 2021. As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-begins-producing-4-nanometer-chips-arizona-raimondo-says-2025-01-10/" data-i13n="slk:Reuters;cpos:10;pos:1"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported at the time, the first facility started operating in early 2025, producing 4 nm chips. Last week, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-shows-off-its-first-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-in-the-us-192836249.html" data-i13n="slk:NVIDIA and TSMC;cpos:11;pos:1">NVIDIA and TSMC</a> showed off the first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-gpus-powered-the-ai-revolution-its-new-blackwell-chips-are-up-to-30-times-faster-001059577.html" data-i13n="slk:Blackwell wafer;cpos:12;pos:1">Blackwell wafer</a> produced at the Arizona plant ahead of domestic volume production.</p><p>Plans for the operation have grown over time, expanding from three facilities up to six to be built over the next decade. And while the initial outline called for the US facilities to remain several process generations behind Taiwan, that is also changing. In his <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://uk.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-tsmc-q3-2025-shows-strong-revenue-growth-93CH-4308618" data-i13n="slk:recent investors call;cpos:13;pos:1">recent investors call</a>, Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei pledged to invest more in the US facility to bring it only one generation behind the Taiwanese facility.&nbsp;</p><p>No amount of investment from TSMC or catch-up from rivals like Samsung and Intel will solve the current bottleneck swiftly. It will take many years, if not decades, for the world to reduce its reliance on Taiwan for bleeding-edge manufacturing. TSMC&#39;s island remains the industry&#39;s weak point, and should something go wrong, the consequences could be dire indeed.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/openais-recent-chip-deals-heap-more-pressure-on-tsmc-130000194.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bethesda has announced that it&#39;s releasing a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced">10th anniversary version of <em>Fallout 4</em></a> on November 10, similar to what it did for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bethesda-10th-anniversary-edition-skyrim-084030796.html"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a>. <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> bundles the base game with Automatron, Far Harbor, Nuka-World and the Workshop expansions. The original open world game was released in 2015 and takes place in the year 2287, 210 years after the Great War. Like the other games in the franchise, it&#39;s set in a post-apocalyptic world with the aesthetics of 1940s and 1950s USA.</p>
<p>This particular entry in the franchise revolves around the Sole Survivor of Vault 111 who was frozen in a cryogenic pod and woke up 210 years since the nuclear attack. The protagonist&#39;s constant companion in the game is a dog named Dogmeat, but they have six other possible companions: their old robot butler Codsworth, Deacon the railroad agent, the mayor of the Goodneighbor settlement named John Hancock, an artificial synth or humanoid robot named Nick Valentine, Piper Wright the reporter, and Preston Garvey, who&#39;s a member of the paramilitary force Minutemen.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The European Commission has found that Meta and TikTok had <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2503">violated rules</a> under the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) and is now giving them the chance to comply if they don&#39;t want to be fined up to 6 percent of their total worldwide annual turnover. According to the Commission, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have &quot;put in place burdensome procedures and tools&quot; for researchers who want to request access to public data. This means they&#39;re stuck with incomplete or unreliable information if they want to do research on topics like how minors are exposed to illegal or harmful content online. &quot;Allowing researchers access to platforms&#39; data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA,&quot; the Commission wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is charging Meta over the lack of a user-friendly mechanism that would allow users to easily report posts with illegal content, such as child sexual abuse materials. The Commission explained that Facebook and Instagram use mechanisms that require several steps to be able to flag posts, and they use dark interface designs that make reporting confusing and dissuading. All those factors are in breach of DSA rules that require online platforms to give EU users easy-to-use mechanisms to be able to report illegal content.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the DSA, users must also be able to challenge social networks&#39; decisions to remove their posts or suspend their accounts. The Commission found that neither Facebook nor Instagram allow users to explain their sides or provide evidence to substantiate their appeals, which limits the effectiveness of the appeal process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta and TikTok will be able to examine the Commission&#39;s investigation files and to reply in writing about its findings. They&#39;ll also have the opportunity to implement changes to comply with DSA rules, and it&#39;s only if the Commission decides they&#39;re non-compliant that they can be fined up to 6 percent of their global annual turnover. Meta disagreed that it had breached DSA rules, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/d914e7a3-c008-4eca-bd3f-dab0f8ef673c"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. &quot;In the European Union, we have introduced changes to our content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force and are confident that these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU,&quot; it said in a statement. Meanwhile, TikTok said it was reviewing the Commission&#39;s findings but that &quot;requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR in direct tension.&quot; It&#39;s asking regulators for guidance on &quot;how these obligations should be reconciled.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-charges-meta-and-tiktok-over-failures-to-tackle-illegal-content-121533180.html?src=rss]]></description>

To put it into perspective, the lowest we've tracked it is $54, and that only happened briefly at the end of 2024. Today's sale applies to multiple colorways.</p> 
<p>This model topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">best power banks</a>, and with very good reason. It's a workhorse that gets the job done. It includes Qi2 tech for fast wireless charging and ships with a sturdy kickstand to prop up smartphones during use. The integrated LED display makes it easy to see the battery percentage, which is always nice.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="f1e42e3b365541f7ac8b06d2be76f53d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Certified-Ultra-Fast-MagSafe-Compatible-Portable/dp/B0CFDPQXN4/ref=ast_sto_dp_puis?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The 10,000mAh battery should charge a modern iPhone nearly two times before requiring a trip to the outlet. For those not keen on wireless charging, there's a USB-C port.</p> 
<p>As for compatibility, this power bank has been <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">optimized for Apple iPhones</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A federal court ruled that Facebook parent Meta can&#39;t use attorney-client privilege to block internal documents and research related to teen harm, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/meta-lawyers-advised-blocking-teen-harm-research-to-avoid-suits"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a> reported. The decision is a setback to Meta in its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/forty-one-states-sue-meta-for-harming-the-mental-health-of-its-youngest-users-162521184.html">lawsuits against multiple states</a> that accused the company of making its platforms addictive despite knowing they were harmful to teenagers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judge Yvonne Williams of the Washington, DC Superior Court found that Meta&#39;s lawyers advised employees to &quot;remove,&quot; &quot;block,&quot; &quot;button up&quot; or &quot;limit&quot; portions of internal studies on the harm of social media to teens&#39; mental health, in order to limit the company&#39;s legal liability. The court said that this advice appeared to be an attempt to cover up or alter information, meaning it falls under the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege. Meta now has seven days to turn over four documents created between November 2022 and July 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta disagreed with the ruling, a spokesperson told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement. &quot;These were routine, appropriate lawyer-client discussions and contrary to the District’s misleading claim, no research findings were deleted or destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>The ruling is related to lawsuits filed in a California court involving dozens of US state attorneys general. Also involved are hundreds of private civil lawsuits filed by parents, teens and school boards against Meta and other platforms around social media addiction and harms. The first trials are scheduled to start in 2026.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-lawyers-tried-to-block-internal-research-showing-teen-harm-judge-rules-120015673.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, Samsung showed off <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-everything-you-need-to-know-111532664.html"><ins>Galaxy XR</ins></a>, its Vision Pro-troubling headset, and you can bet we’ve done a deep dive. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-a-smarter-more-open-take-on-apples-vision-pro-for-half-the-price-020044642.html"><ins>Sam Rutherford got one of these strapped to his head and has plenty of feelings about the new hardware</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The headset is lighter, more comfortable and easier to live with than Apple’s Vision Pro, even if it lacks many of its headline features. The software ecosystem is already pretty broad, thanks to Google making a real effort with Android XR, but dedicated apps are still a bit rare.</p>
<p>Samsung’s entry into the market might provide some much-needed impetus for this type of augmented reality headset. That it’s half the price of Apple’s Vision Pro may also loosen some wallets eager to get into this world.</p>
<p>But it’s hard not to see this as Samsung running down the same cul-de-sac Apple is now lurking at the end of. It has allowed other companies, like Meta, to waltz in and grab an early lead in the much more useful smart glasses market.</p>

Getting into the zone during a long run with your preferred music, be it rap, classic rock or today’s pop hits, can totally change your experience for the better. To do that, you have to start with a good pair of running headphones.<br><br>But not all <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html">wireless workout headphones</a> are created equally, and runners need to consider specific factors before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. I’ve tested out more than a dozen pairs to find which are the best headphones for running for all budgets and all kinds of runners.</p>

<p>When it comes to running and working out, the edge that the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">AirPods Pro 3</a> have over the Pro 2, or even the top picks on our list, is built-in heart rate monitoring. That means you could go out with just your Pro 3 earbuds and your iPhone and still get heart rate information for your entire training session. But otherwise, the Pro 3 buds are just as capable as the Pro 2 when it comes to exercise. Some may prefer the soft-touch finish on our top picks to the AirPods' slick texture.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

However, they cost $50 more than the Powerbeats Fit, and the main added advantage here is built-in heart rate sensors.</p>

The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-jbl-endurance-peak-3">JBL Endurance Peak 3</h3> 
<p>The most noteworthy thing about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&amp;itemId=amazon_B0BQPW9R9H&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fe4b4bca-f0b8-4c26-ac93-056dd7afc29c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon+Canada&amp;linkText=Endurance+Peak+3&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAARV8riLRmcXr9U9UcKMleH4JFAiLJlOE8CiicoGZrM6B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJBL-Endurance-Peak-Wireless-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0BQPW9R9H%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Endurance-Peak-Wireless-Headphones/dp/B0BQPW9R9H/">Endurance Peak 3</a> is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-running-headphones">What to look for in running headphones</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design">Design</h3> 
<p>Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">wireless earbuds</a>. While you could wear over-ear or on-ear Bluetooth headphones during a run, most of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html">best headphones</a> available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world.</p> 
<p>Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-water-resistance-and-dust-protection">Water resistance and dust protection</h3> 
<p>Water resistance and dust protection are crucial for the best running headphones to have since you’ll likely be sweating while wearing them. Also, if you have the unfortunate luck of getting caught in the rain during a run, at least your gear will survive. Here’s a quick rundown of ingress protection (IP) ratings, which you’ll see attached to many earbuds on the market today. The first digit after the abbreviation rates dust protection on a scale from one to six — the higher, the better. The second digit refers to water- resistance, or waterproofing in some cases, ranked on a scale from one to nine. A letter “X” in either position means the device isn’t rated for the corresponding material.</p> 
<p>Check out <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.enclosurecompany.com/ip-ratings-explained.php">this guide</a> for an even more detailed breakdown. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating (most have even more protection), which means they can withstand sweat and splashes but do not have dust protection.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-active-noise-cancellation-and-transparency-mode">Active noise cancellation and transparency mode</h3> 
<p>Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming a standard feature on wireless earbuds, at least in those above a certain price. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and continue to serve you when you’re off the trail, ANC is good to have. It adds versatility by allowing you to block out the hum of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute on public transit.</p> 
<p>But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand in hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many earbuds with ANC support some sort of “transparency mode” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because you don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re exercising outside along busy streets. Lowering noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life">Battery life</h3> 
<p>All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most runners, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session.</p> 
<p>Speaking of, you’ll get an average of 20-28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html">wireless charger</a> to power up.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-headphones-for-running">How we test headphones for running</h2> 
<p>When testing to determine the best running headphones, I wear each contender during as many runs as possible. I typically run three to five days each week, completing at least a 5K (3.01 miles) each time. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you’re on the tread or trail (as a note, I primarily run outside). I’m also paying attention to fit over time, particularly if the earbuds get slippery or loose while I sweat, or if they tend to pop out or feel less stable in my ears as I pick up speed or make quick movements.</p> 
<p>I also use the earbuds when not running to take calls and listen to music, podcasts and the like throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities.</p> 
<p>While I am also listening for audio quality, I’m admittedly not an expert in this space. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about sound quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">buying guides</a>. Here, however, I will make note of audio-quality characteristics if they stood out to me (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’re able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Much like we do for our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html#how-we-test-tablets">best tablets overall</a>, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Geekbench+6&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nZWVrYmVuY2gtNi9pZDE1NjU3Mjg4OTUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvZ2Vla2JlbmNoLTYvaWQxNTY1NzI4ODk1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXLw1CqK2-DJCUdZ10z8y3y5zoaT1DIRM0hVETVdaXCR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgeekbench-6%2Fid1565728895" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geekbench-6/id1565728895">Geekbench 6</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=3DMark&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC8zZG1hcmsvaWQxNTEyMzcyMjkzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvYXBwLzNkbWFyay9pZDE1MTIzNzIyOTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUlFo5xbxpX14gaLPTNphOWPyRGmEcb45197gjO2djrT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2F3dmark%2Fid1512372293" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3dmark/id1512372293">3DMark</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=GFXBench+Metal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nZnhiZW5jaC1tZXRhbC9pZDk4OTA4MDkwMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiM2E4MTgtNjZiMy00NmJmLTk4ZTMtMTY2MzlhZDg2OThhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nZnhiZW5jaC1tZXRhbC9pZDk4OTA4MDkwMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAesW5iaopzqBQpoqZbGWmdYhSuM8pSGLxJSrwaFqxW3W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgfxbench-metal%2Fid989080902" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gfxbench-metal/id989080902">GFXBench Metal</a>, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>To help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-new-features-coming-to-ipados-26">What are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?</h3> 
<p>Apple released the latest update to its iPad operating system, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html">iPadOS 26</a>, in September. The update is a fairly significant overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-bringing-preview-to-ipados-175643371.html">Preview app</a>; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It also uses the new “<a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">liquid glass</a>” design language that Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025.</p> 
<p>That said, it completely removed the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ie/102576">“slide over” and “split view”</a> modes found in previous versions of iPadOS, which can make quickly viewing multiple apps at once a little more cumbersome. (Though the former <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apple-is-bringing-back-slide-over-in-ipados-261-190036025.html">will now return</a> in an upcoming update.) Notably, most of these features are available across Apple’s tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/os/ipados/">Apple’s overview page</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-ipads-typically-last">How long do iPads typically last?</h3> 
<p>If history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/ipad/ipad213a25b2/ipados">iPadOS 26 update</a>, for example, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://endoflife.date/ipad">is available</a> on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html">iPad case</a>.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-the-ipad-and-the-ipad-air">What’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?</h3> 
<p>Compared to the standard iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance prospects, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. Its display supports a wider <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3">P3</a> color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">faster Wi-Fi 6E</a>, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.</p> 
<p>Starting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-79-apple-pencil-has-a-usb-c-charging-port-141732710.html">USB-C</a> Apple Pencils – which are <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html">more convoluted</a> to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Magic+Keyboard+Folio&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9zZWxlY3QtaXBhZC1rZXlib2FyZHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3Avc2VsZWN0LWlwYWQta2V5Ym9hcmRzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaXdYRY-ix39wbG7s9mrj2Kn0AUJuI_i_EC3onSQrOH2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-ipad-keyboards" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9zZWxlY3QtaXBhZC1rZXlib2FyZHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYr6D5fyvVZGUJfJ0ZmRXcoXzdAGDilzRWqO1gH7O44u&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-ipad-keyboards&amp;uuid=DiDrMtUfvQdnYxtx38705">Magic Keyboard Folio</a>.</p>

<p>The operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/battle-of-the-dirt-cheap-tablets-amazon-fire-hd-8-vs-walmart-onn-8-130031544.html">see an $80 iPad</a> anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS (though the former <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/android-is-making-it-more-difficult-to-sideload-apps">may no longer be an option</a> in the coming months). Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.</p> 
<p>But we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-an-ipad-replace-a-laptop">Can an iPad replace a laptop?</h3> 
<p>This is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html">iPad accessories</a>. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.</p> 
<p>Broadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. The recent iPadOS 26 update does close the gap a bit, though it’s still not quite as fluid. Safari on the iPad isn’t fully on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-take-a-screenshot-on-an-ipad">How do I take a screenshot on an iPad?</h3> 
<p>As we note in our <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device-163053556.html">screenshot how-to guide</a>, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we&#39;ve seen with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-2023-prius-prime-plug-in-hybrid-162057073.html">Toyota&#39;s Prius Prime</a>, putting a solar panel on a car&#39;s roof is a nifty idea but can only gain you a few free miles a day due to the limited size. With a new prototype of its hyper-popular Sakura &quot;kei&quot; EV, Nissan has the answer: a bigger solar panel roof called the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-4490cf5fc2161a51d431ba720301391e">AO-Solar Extender</a>. When fully stretched out on a sunny day, it can add about 1,864 miles of driving distance a year and power multiple accessories.</p>
<p>The panel works whether you&#39;re driving or parked. When extended (in &quot;solar pompadour&quot; mode as my colleague put it), it generates 500 watts on sunny days. At the same time, it helps block sunlight from the windshield, &quot;reducing cabin temperature and lowering the need for air conditioning power consumption,&quot; Nissan noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/be4c0a10-b097-11f0-bfd6-66ab36382b98" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/be4c0a10-b097-11f0-bfd6-66ab36382b98" style="height:1573px;width:2800px;" alt="Nissan made a nifty solar panel system for its Sakura EV" data-uuid="384b6285-df78-327f-af42-18c17834d8b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NISSAN DESIGN</div></figure>
<p>When retracted in driving mode, it still pumps out 300 watts in the sun (80 watts in the rain), quite a bit more than the 185 watts max generated by the Prius Prime&#39;s solar roof. And if you&#39;re worried about aerodynamics, Nissan said the roof is designed to minimize drag and integrate well with the Sakura&#39;s design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just a fun exercise, as Nissan said it&#39;s planning to launch the AO-Solar Extender commercially, with details to follow at a later date. It could be a useful accessory on the Sakura, which has been Japan&#39;s most popular EV since 2022 thanks to its &quot;sufficient&quot; range, cute kei looks and spacious interior. The automaker will show it off at the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.japan-mobility-show.com/en/">Japan Mobility Show</a> starting on October 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nissan-made-a-nifty-solar-panel-system-for-its-sakura-ev-061235566.html?src=rss]]></description>

For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.<br><br>On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure.

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-private-internet-access"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=Private+Internet+Access&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb2xZhJgbuYJ1Fdt6xW-K50AZouRlBZmdjdZsNQwkI8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h3> 
<p>Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.</p> 
<p>PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html">PIA VPN review</a>.</p> 
<p>The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla's speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vpn-faqs">VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. There are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, so always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google's One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electronic Arts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> a new partnership with Stability AI, the creator of AI image generation tool <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/stable-diffusion-35-follows-your-prompts-more-closely-and-generates-more-diverse-people-184022965.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Stable Diffusion</a>. The company will &quot;co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows&quot; for the game developer, with the hopes of speeding up development while maintaining quality.</p><p>&quot;I use the term smarter paintbrushes,” Steve Kestell, Head of Technical Art for EA SPORTS said in the announcement. &quot;We are giving our creatives the tools to express what they want.&quot; To start, the &quot;smarter paintbrushes&quot; EA and Stability AI are building are concentrated on generating textures and in-game assets. EA hopes to create &quot;Physically Based Rendering materials&quot; with new tools &quot;that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company also describes using AI to &quot;pre-visualize entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation of game content.&quot; Stability AI is most famous for its powerful Stable Diffusion image generator, but the company maintains multiple tools for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://stability.ai/stable-3d" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">generating 3D models</a>, too, so the partnership is by no means out of place.</p><p>It helps that AI is on the tip of most video game executives&#39; tongues. Strauss Zelnick, the head of Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two,<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-ceo-predicts-genai-will-create-jobs-not-kill-them" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"> recently shared</a> that generative AI &quot;will not reduce employment, it will increase employment,&quot; because &quot;technology always increases productivity, which in turn increases GDP, which in turn increases employment.&quot; Krafton, the publisher of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, made its commitment to AI even more clear, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">announcing plans</a> on Thursday to become an AI-first company. Companies with a direct stake in the success of the AI industry, like Microsoft, have also created <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-windows-pcs-and-the-xbox-mobile-app-185452965.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">gaming-focused tools</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-trained-an-ai-model-on-a-game-no-one-played-160038242.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">developed models</a> for prototyping. </p><p>The motivations for EA might be even simpler, though. The company is in the midst of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">being taken private</a>, and will soon be saddled with billions in debt. Theoretically cutting costs with AI might be one way the company hopes to survive the transition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-partners-with-the-company-behind-stable-diffusion-to-make-games-with-ai-222253069.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Confession time: I’ve had the <em>Sleep Awake</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Steam page</a> open in a tab for about a month (hey, we all organize our thoughts in unique and beautiful ways), just so I don’t forget about it. The past year has been stacked with fabulous original games across a wide range of genres, including horror, and this is one I didn’t want to miss. Now, I can close the tab and  put a firm release date on the calendar, as <em>Sleep Awake</em> is officially due to hit PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 2. Happy holidays, indeed.</p><p><em>Sleep Awake </em>is a first-person, narrative-heavy, psychedelic horror game set in the last known city on an Earth that’s been ravaged by The HUSH, a mysterious force that disappears anyone who falls asleep. Katja must stay alert and survive the city as its citizens experiment on themselves in increasingly extreme ways, attempting to achieve permanent wakefulness and outmaneuver The HUSH. Needless to say, things get weird.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1GrdtdSPh0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Sleep Awake</em> comes from Eyes Out, the studio founded by <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, and it’s published by Blumhouse Games. Finck is responsible for the trippy audio stylings of <em>Sleep Awake</em>, of course. This is the studio’s debut title and something they’ve been working on for four years. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Back in 2021</a>, Davis and Finck told Engadget they were focused on building an ultra-immersive, audio-driven horror experience with a nightmarish bent.</p><p>“The type of horror that we&#39;re building has a lot to do with the horrors of the universe and the horrors that you kind of go to sleep with at night, the ones that are just around the corner and outside of our purview, but exist,” Davis said. “And the technology for building those types of soundscapes, the localized audio and reverb and the realism behind that, coming from VR before, I had a lot of opportunity to work with that stuff.”</p><p>Finck added the following: “I&#39;m really excited about the nuance and the subtlety of coming from silence, like a really impactful silence, and beginning to emerge from that silence towards an impactful embellishment of some sort, however great or greater. And that play between the diegetic soundscape of the world within the tangible, physical space inside the game, and where it blurs with the score, the music of the game, can be really challenging and inspiring.”</p><p>Blumhouse Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-fear-the-spotlight-became-blumhouses-first-video-game-140044877.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">published its first horror project</a>, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, in October 2024 and on top of <em>Sleep Awake</em>, it has a steady stream of additional terrors in store.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple will owe money to UK users after losing an App Store antitrust lawsuit there on Thursday, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/37a5c1e4-4433-4b56-b47f-f80fcd3d52b8"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. The Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the iPhone maker abused its dominant market position to inflate developer fees.</p>
<p>The tribunal found that the company has &quot;near absolute market power&quot; for iOS app distribution and in-app payments. The decision declared that Apple has been &quot;abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices.&quot; <em>FT</em> reports that Apple will appeal the decision.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The class action claimants said damages of about £1.5bn would be split between 36 million consumers. A subsequent hearing to determine the process for &quot;resolving any questions relating to the calculation&quot; of damages could come as soon as next month.</p>
<p>Apple has an increasingly strained relationship with the tighter regulations across the Atlantic. Earlier this week, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-steps-up-its-attacks-on-europes-dma-regulations-175332390.html">stepped up its attacks</a> on the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">protect consumers from Big Tech dominance</a>. And on Wednesday, the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-confirms-apple-and-google-have-strategic-market-status-in-mobile-platforms">confirmed</a> that Apple has &quot;strategic market status&quot; in <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-passes-its-version-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-175642166.html">the country&#39;s equivalent</a> of the DMA. That gives the CMA authority to &quot;ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple provided the following statement in response to the ruling:</p>
<p><em>&quot;We thank the tribunal for its consideration but strongly disagree with this ruling, which takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy. The App Store has benefited businesses and consumers across the U.K., creating a dynamic marketplace where developers compete and users can choose from millions of innovative apps. This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments. The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections — giving developers and consumers many options in how they build, share, and download apps. We intend to appeal.&quot;</em></p>

Nike says the first-generation model consists of a running shoe with a carbon fiber plate, a calf-mounted rechargeable battery, a motor and a drive belt. While it has the neon colors and cushioned finish of a normal pair of running shoes, the basic design of Project Amplify seems like a more polished version of the robotic Sidekick shoes Dephy is already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.dephy.com/about" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">pitching on its website</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Amplify doesn&#39;t replace your legs&#39; ability to walk or run, but rather makes going further and faster easier. Nike compares the experience to an e-bike, which typically don&#39;t eliminate the need for pedaling, and instead augment your pedals with power from an electric motor. Nike says Project Amplify &quot;makes walking or running uphill feel like moving on flat ground,&quot; and in the case of some people who tested it, turned a 12-minute mile into a 10-minute mile. Dephy and the Nike Sport Research Lab (NSRL) worked with more than 400 different athletes to test various versions of robotic shoes, covering &quot;over 2.4 million steps, the equivalent of roughly 12,000 laps around the NSRL’s 200-meter track.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The companies&#39; approach, melding an existing fashion brand with robotics, is similar to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://squamish.arcteryxacademy.com/mo/go" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Arc&#39;teryx&#39;s MO/GO pants</a> from 2024, robotic trousers developed in partnership with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.skipwithjoy.com/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Skip</a> that help hikers with balance and endurance. Project Amplify is smaller (and hopefully less expensive), but robot-assisted gadgets increasingly seem like a way robotics research could make its way into consumer products, beyond things like vacuums.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/nike-mind-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/nike-mind-1.jpg" style="height:2070px;width:3200px;" alt="The Nike Mind 001 mules and Nike Mind 002 sneakers on a white background." data-uuid="0acb3ea6-d34d-447d-a711-bf40c2b05169"><figcaption>The Nike Mind 001 mules and Nike Mind 002 sneakers on a white background.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nike</div></figure><p>Nike&#39;s Mind 001 and Mind 002 shoes are based on the company&#39;s neuroscience research, and are strange in a different way.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Strava&#39;s big attack on Garmin didn&#39;t last long. On Tuesday, the former filed paperwork to dismiss its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/strava-sues-garmin-in-bizarre-patent-infringement-lawsuit-213300227.html">patent infringement lawsuit</a> against the latter, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-drops-voluntarily-lawsuit-against.html"><em>DC Rainmaker</em></a>. The battle, which included a &quot;Setting the record straight&quot; Reddit post from Strava&#39;s chief product officer, lasted all of 21 days.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accused Garmin of infringing on patents related to heat maps and segments. Strava asked the court to halt all sales of infringing Garmin products, which, according to its characterization, would have been, well, most of them.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Strava Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar escalated the fight with an October 2 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin/">Reddit post</a>. He said his company&#39;s legal maneuver was in response to Garmin API guidelines that &quot;required the Garmin logo to be present on every single activity post, screen, graph, image, sharing card, etc.&quot; Salazar wrote that Garmin &quot;wants to use Strava and every other partner as an advertising platform — they told us they care more about their marketing than your user experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Those are fighting words, and Strava appeared to be digging in for a righteous and bitter battle against its partner. But now, it&#39;s essentially, &quot;Eh, never mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Why the quick reversal? We reached out to Strava for comment, and we&#39;ll update this post if we hear back. But closed-door discussions between the companies, possibly including threats from Garmin to counter-sue, seem likely. Garmin has a stacked patent library and a strong record defending them in court. Besides, <em>DC Rainmaker</em> says Strava&#39;s case (especially the parts related to heat map patents) didn&#39;t appear to hold much water in the first place.</p>
<p>Strava&#39;s initial move was all the more bizarre, considering how much its business model depends on activity data from Garmin devices. The two companies have a longstanding relationship, which you can imagine isn&#39;t so healthy at the moment. Losing access to Garmin&#39;s legion of devices could have been catastrophic to the San Francisco-based Strava, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/12/strava-eyes-ipo-as-gen-z-trades-dating-apps-for-running-clubs/">plans</a> to file an IPO next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/strava-pulls-the-plug-on-its-garmin-lawsuit-after-just-21-days-204255109.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know there are bigger fish to fry, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't draw your attention to this <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://youtu.be/LiVseDxOVSc?si=u9xCHHosSkeR_UR2" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">travesty of a commercial</a> Verizon just released. It's only 30 seconds long but may go down as one of the worst ads I've ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What’s so offensive, you ask? Well, the carrier (and one-time parent company of Engadget) wants to promote the fact that it will give AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers a better deal on their wireless plan if they bring in their monthly cellular bill. That's all well and good, but we need to talk about the cathode-ray tube TV that's at the center of the commercial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LiVseDxOVSc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The ad opens with a woman walking into a Best Buy-coded store and handing over a 27-inch CRT TV to a nearby sales associate. "Hi, I got this old thing and the bill from the store where I got it," she tells the young salesperson while casually tossing the TV to him. "Figured you could beat it with a better deal on one of these big boys," she adds, pointing to, let’s be honest, an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvRyVZWuvQ4" data-i13n="slk:objectively worse flat panel TV;cpos:2;pos:1">objectively worse flat panel TV</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I need to know: did anyone who worked on this commercial try to lift a CRT? Look, I know it's 2025, and even the newest sets are now close to two decades old, but even if you've never seen one in real-life, surely you've heard how heavy they are? If I had to guess, the TV we see in the commercial, which looks like an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://crtdatabase.com/crts/rca/rca-27r411t" data-i13n="slk:RCA 27R411T;cpos:3;pos:1">RCA 27R411T</a>, weighs close to 75 pounds. There's a reason so many Facebook Marketplace listings recommend you bring a friend with you when you come pick up the CRT they're selling; most people can't lift even a mid-sized set on their own.&nbsp;</p><p>I hate to think how Verizon made this commercial. CRTs are a dead technology. No company is making new consumer sets anymore, and any working CRTs left out in the world are on borrowed time. If the company gutted a working set to make this commercial, it means there’s one less CRT in an ever-dwindling pool. Someone could have enjoyed that TV and stopped it from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/american-e-waste-is-causing-a-hidden-tsunami-of-junk-in-southeast-asia-171344351.html" data-i13n="slk:entering a landfill;cpos:4;pos:1">entering a landfill</a>.</p><p>But as for the rest of the commercial, it’s equally as bad. No big box retailer is accepting trade-ins for a CRT TV, and even if they were, trying to get rid of one that way would be a rookie move. CRTs, both TVs and monitors, are highly sought after by retro gamers. Even a relatively unknown set like the 27R411T can catch a few hundred dollars, especially if it's in pristine condition. In fact, a quick <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link rapid-with-clickid rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5a36d98f-e3c9-4ccc-96f8-f261b8484c73&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=29564439-d966-4432-8775-5aa689e9d1e9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=eBay&amp;linkText=eBay+search&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYmF5LmNvbS9pdG0vMTg2NzM1MDgwMTAwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyOTU2NDQzOS1kOTY2LTQ0MzItODc3NS01YWE2ODllOWQxZTkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmViYXkuY29tL2l0bS8xODY3MzUwODAxMDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbh3hsjtT8cybbS84hvYVXPhNSY1v-YuuYSgxQUaIcIR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F186735080100" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:eBay;elmt:;slk:eBay search;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.ebay.com/itm/186735080100">eBay search</a> returns a seller looking for $350 for their 27R411T unit.&nbsp;</p><p>But you know what our dear Verizon booster does? She just walks away without the CRT after the salesperson tells her the shop won't give her a better deal on a new TV. "Guess you're not as cool as Verizon" she says, uttering a thing no one in the history has ever said. Sorry, joke's on you, lady. Not only is that TV impossibly light, it's way cooler than anything Verizon has ever done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/verizons-latest-ad-defies-crt-physics-202441012.html?src=rss]]></description>

However. the company just upended that precedent with the M EV1, a 60MP mirrorless camera with a classic M design but an electronic viewfinder (EVF) in place of the rangefinder.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It may upset purists, but it's a move that makes sense from a sales point of view. Leica's old-school film cameras used its M mount lens system and, in order to keep the bodies compact, didn't have reflex mirrors like SLRs. Instead, they used an optical rangefinder, which provides a weird, offset and inaccurate view of the scene. Leica kept the rangefinders when it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-09-14-leica-m8-combines-old-world-charm-with-new-world-tech.html">launched its digital M </a>cameras, even though it could have switched to an EVF.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>In 2014, Leica <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-22-leica-t-hands-on.html">launched</a> a more modern mirrorless camera lineup with the new SL mount that did use electronic viewfinders. However, they have always <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-20-leica-sl.html">lacked</a> the cachet, compact size and gorgeous looks of the M-System, so don't appeal as much to well-heeled buyers that want the full Leica experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Enter the M EV1, which looks exactly like you want a Leica to look but boots the rangefinder in favor of an EVF. "Designed for both devoted Leica enthusiasts and those new to the M System, it makes capturing beautiful, intentional photographs easier than ever," the company wrote. Leica probably noticed buyers who <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilm-x100-vi-review-a-one-of-a-kind-camera-for-street-photography-and-travel-133004951.html">wanted a pretty camera</a> were drawn to the M series, but then put off by the wonky rangefinders.</p> 
<p>Handmade in Germany, the M EV1 is definitely beautiful, with the classic rounded rectangular M shape and a new diamond-patterned leatherette to give it a distinctive look compared to the rangefinder models. Leica also eliminated the dedicated ISO dial (the setting is now done via another control), which helped make it 1.62 ounces lighter than the M11-P. It has a new custom function lever that lets you activate focusing aids and digital zoom options while looking through the viewfinder.</p>

<p>That viewfinder is definitely a good one, with 5.76 million dots of resolution for a sharp view. The rear screen has a sharp 2.32-million-dot display, but is fixed in place and doesn't tilt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Otherwise, the M EV1 has similar specs to the M11-P. It has a high resolution 60MP sensor with support for 14-bit RAW images processed using Leica's excellent color science and burst speeds up to 4.5 fps. You can shoot with the mechanical shutter at up to 1/4000th and 1/16,000th in silent mode (flash sync is 1/180th). Focusing is strictly manual, with magnification and focus peaking assist functions. Naturally, it uses Leica's famous and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2aa8b5df-7e77-4da6-95a2-3a758302c13a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;linkText=tremendously+expensive&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2Mvc2VhcmNoP3E9TGVpY2ElMjBNJTIwbW91bnQlMjBsZW5zJmZpbHRlcnM9ZmN0X2JyYW5kX25hbWUlM0FsZWljYSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmFhOGI1ZGYtN2U3Ny00ZGE2LTk1YTItM2E3NTgzMDJjMTNhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2Mvc2VhcmNoP3E9TGVpY2ElMjBNJTIwbW91bnQlMjBsZW5zJmZpbHRlcnM9ZmN0X2JyYW5kX25hbWUlM0FsZWljYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZlyl7C_PNb8nZxcP3PISiLKttetyXZHeR85stm4GpaU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DLeica%2520M%2520mount%2520lens%26filters%3Dfct_brand_name%253Aleica" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=Leica%20M%20mount%20lens&amp;filters=fct_brand_name%3Aleica">tremendously expensive</a> compact M mount lenses.

<p>Though some features are old school, the M EV1 lets you connect to Leica's Fotos app via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or a cable for quick sharing on social media and elsewhere. It also supports Leica's <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/leicas-m11-p-is-a-disinformation-resistant-camera-built-for-wealthy-photojournalists-130032517.html">Content Credentials system</a> that enables the origin and history of an image to be clearly traced to avoid copyright theft or AI spoofing. Other features include 64GB of built-in storage along with UHS-II SD card support, and a meager 237 shots on a battery charge when using the EVF.</p>

You also may wonder what the real-world differences are between models and who they’re best for. To make things even more interesting, Apple keeps announcing new chips. The latest, the M5 <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">came out October 15</a>, and is now found in the base model, 14-inch MacBook Pro (as well as the iPad Pro and the Vision Pro). This guide breaks down Apple’s terminology, as well as all which upgrades make the most sense so you can get the best MacBook for what you want to do.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-budget-macbooks">What about budget MacBooks?</h2> 
<p>Historically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Now, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&amp;H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.</p> 
<p>Of course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">decent PCs for under $500</a>. If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a6dcab25-0d73-4da2-98ba-8a4bd8cb864d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=refurbished+options+directly+from+Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9yZWZ1cmJpc2hlZC9tYWMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2ZGNhYjI1LTBkNzMtNGRhMi05OGJhLThhNGJkOGNiODY0ZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQvbWFjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfCgP8G9TK47ylIkIX9-dZCqtvqfvfF5HSRhj5hhY8X0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac">refurbished options directly from Apple</a>, or even third party sellers like BackMarket.

Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-macbook">Factors to consider when buying a MacBook</h2> 
<p>Compared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">M1</a> chip, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html">used Intel chips</a> in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-chips-pro-max-003004080.html">M3</a> generations followed that first chip and currently, MacBooks come equipped with M4 and M5-series chips.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air. The base-model 14-inch Pro now comes with either <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">the latest M5 chip</a>. Other Pro configurations have the M4 Max or the M4 Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-new-mac-studio-comes-with-the-long-awaited-m3-ultra-chip-140005216.html">M3 series</a> in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.</p> 
<p>While a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-cores"><strong>CPU cores</strong></h3> 
<p>The lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. The base-model MacBook Pro uses the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">latest M5 chip</a>, but only on the 14-inch model. The upgraded versions of that laptop use the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips (which are a step up from their predecessors, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-report-reveals-details-on-the-three-m3-chips-apple-may-launch-monday-night-202456989.html">M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max</a> chips). The <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-unveils-its-top-of-the-line-m4-max-chip-150241987.html">M4 Max</a> is the burliest chip and built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-ram"><strong>RAM</strong></h3> 
<p>Your options for RAM (or unified memory) varies, but when Apple switched to the M4 chip for the MacBook Air, the lowest amount of RAM you can get was bumped to 16GB. That’s a necessary jump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-imac-gets-an-m4-refresh-for-faster-apple-intelligence-151251449.html">Apple Intelligence</a> (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM. The M5 chip in the base-model MacBook Pro comes with a minimum of 16GB and can be configured to a maximum of 32GB of RAM..</p> 
<p>You’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.</p> 
<p>In addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use.</p> 
<p>For a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-storage-capacity-ssd"><strong>Storage capacity (SSD)</strong></h3> 
<p>Storage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.</p> 
<p>When Apple announced the <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-first-impressions-lights-camera-action-button-200647981.html">iPhone 15</a>, the company also announced new iCloud+ <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/icloud-adds-new-6tb-and-12tb-storage-tiers-194853580.html">storage storage plans</a>, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-screen-size"><strong>Screen size</strong></h3> 
<p>The MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html">reviewed</a> the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen "makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.</p> 
<p>But screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.</p> 
<p>All MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (<a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html">in-plane switching</a>, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).</p> 
<p>You also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.</p> 
<p>Compared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-systems"><strong>Operating systems</strong></h3> 
<p>Software considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html">if you’re switching</a> from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/metal-4-for-macos-tahoe-26-introduces-new-gaming-features-like-frame-interpolation-183247623.html">better graphics</a> coming to Macs.</p> 
<p>As for macOS, it’s getting better too. With <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html">macOS Tahoe 26</a>, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design</a> for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price"><strong>Price</strong></h3> 
<p>When Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a6dcab25-0d73-4da2-98ba-8a4bd8cb864d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=AppleCare&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYXBwbGVjYXJlLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZkY2FiMjUtMGQ3My00ZGEyLTk4YmEtOGE0YmQ4Y2I4NjRkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYXBwbGVjYXJlLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW7l2Hiboe-Xov9ubl4eKAGiAjzsUFuZNqFF-ciyOuIQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapplecare%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/applecare/">AppleCare</a> is another cost to consider.

If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14-inch M5 or 16-inch M4 MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage and 32GB of RAM to make your machine as future-proof as possible.

<h2 id="jump-link-best-macbook-faqs">Best MacBook FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-macbook-air-and-pro"><strong>What's the difference between MacBook Air and Pro?</strong></h3> 
<p>The MacBook Air comes with the M4 chip. The 14-inch, base-model Pro comes with the M5 chip. MacBook Pro models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro models have higher resolution screens with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Game Developers Conference (GDC) is undergoing a major overhaul, according to a report <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-lowers-ticket-prices-streamlines-pass-types-in-festival-of-gaming-reimagination-">by the affiliated publication <em>Game Developer</em></a>. The &quot;reimagined&quot; conference is getting a name change, as it&#39;ll now be called the GDC Festival of Gaming. It&#39;s also changing up how passes work and transitioning the shift of its focus to &quot;meet today&#39;s broader, interconnected games industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the new simplified pass structure. The newly-announced Festival Pass replaces the pre-existing All-Access pass and costs 45 percent less than its predecessor. Pricing starts at $649 and offers access to all of the event&#39;s main content programming. Access to the main conference was previously segmented depending on a number of pass types.</p>

<p>There are two other main pass types. The Digital Pass offers access to online-only networking and costs $799. The Game Changer Pass is the baddest of the bunch, offering all of the above plus access to a facilitated meetings program. This invite-only program promises meetings with industry icons and access to a series of talks called the Luminaries Speaker Series. That one costs $1,700. Indies, start-ups and academics can apply for discounts that can knock another $200 to $300 off the price tag.</p>
<p>As for content, the organization seems to be placing a heavier focus on networking. Organizers say the event wants to serve the industry &quot;across every state of a game&#39;s life cycle&quot; and that all changes were &quot;informed and inspired by feedback from the community.&quot;</p>
<p>The Expo Hall has been redesigned and renamed Festival Hall and will prioritize offering developers opportunities to connect with one another through game demos and social spaces. GDC president Nina Brown described the new event as &quot;celebrating the vital interconnection between creators, leaders and partners that drive the industry forward.&quot;</p>
<p>GDC starts next year in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MKNhYUyU9uk">San Francisco on March 9</a>. It goes until March 13 and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://gdconf.com/">passes are available now</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gdc-is-lowering-ticket-prices-and-overhauling-many-aspects-of-the-conference-183855239.html?src=rss]]></description>

Apple bought that iOS automation app in 2017 and turned it into <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-04-apple-siri-shortcuts.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Shortcuts</a>. </p><p>This year, though, Software Applications Incorporated unveiled Sky, a new automation app for Mac. Given its focus on agentic AI — artificial intelligence systems that carry out actions on your behalf — it’s easy to see why OpenAI would be interested in scooping that up. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5eZa66g8uwY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“Whether you’re chatting, writing, planning, or coding, Sky understands what’s on your screen and can take action using your apps,” Software Applications <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://sky.app/" data-i13n="slk:said;cpos:4;pos:1">said</a>. “Now, we’re joining OpenAI to bring these capabilities to even more people. We can’t wait to share more.”</p><p>OpenAI plans to incorporate “Sky’s deep macOS integration and product craft” into ChatGPT. All of the Software Applications team will join the company.</p><p>Apple has been working on integrating similar features into a new version of Siri.

It&#39;s a premium sequel to the Boox Palma, a phone-shaped E Ink device that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">originally became popular</a> as a &quot;healthy&quot; and less distracting alternative to scrolling on a smartphone. The Palma 2 Pro improves on the original with a 6.3-inch color E Ink screen (a Kaleido display, the same one used on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/kobos-new-ereaders-include-its-first-with-color-displays-040153210.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Kobo Libra Colour</a>) and support for 5G data through a new SIM card slot. The new Palma also runs Android 15, supports Boox&#39;s InkSense Plus stylus for taking notes and includes A-GPS for basic navigation. In other words, it&#39;s a much better smartphone replacement than before.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Boox-Note-Air5-C" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Boox-Note-Air5-C" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="A Boox Note Air5 C tablet in a keyboard cover." data-uuid="a7f11c9c-963b-45e2-adc7-fbb4ca40f27e"><figcaption>A Boox Note Air5 C tablet in a keyboard cover.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Boox</div></figure><p>The Note Air5 C is a bit more familiar. The 10.3-inch E Ink Android tablet is basically a larger version of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/booxs-new-go-7-e-ink-tablets-support-handwriting-with-a-46-stylus-182026839.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Boox Go 7 and Go 7 Color</a> devices Boox announced earlier this year, and an update to the Note Air4 C that&#39;s graced Engadget&#39;s list of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">best E Ink tablets</a>. The main changes Boox has made to this new model are that it runs Android 15 and supports a keyboard cover through the addition of pogo pins on the back. This makes it easier to type up documents on the device, and theoretically lets it support other accessories down the road. Alongside the keyboard, Boox says the new Note Air&#39;s Pen3 stylus is more comfortable to hold, and includes a removable cap for storing extra tips. Using an E Ink Kaleido display means the Note Air5 C might not offer quite the same experience as an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">iPad Pro with iPadOS 26</a>, but a newer version of Android and a keyboard gets it a lot closer.</p><p>Both of Boox&#39;s new devices are available to order now, and should ship in November. The Boox Palma 2 Pro costs $400, while the Boox Note Air5 C costs $530, or $607 in a bundle with a keyboard cover.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/boox-updates-popular-palma-e-ink-device-with-color-and-5g-connectivity-180000230.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is bringing more of its generative AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/ai-restyle-instagram-stories" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">to Instagram Stories</a>. With the changes, you can now use text prompts to remove or change objects in your photos or &quot;restyle&quot; the image completely.</p><p>The new tools live in a new &quot;restyle&quot; menu at the top of the Stories composer. You can select &quot;add,&quot; &quot;remove&quot; or &quot;change&quot; to tweak specific elements of your images. These features work a lot like either AI-based image editing tools; you can do things like remove stray objects from the backgrounds of photos or change up a person&#39;s outfit. You can also make more dramatic edits, like in the photo below, when I asked Meta AI to &quot;change the background to make it look like the cat is in space.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-23_at_10.17.39.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-23_at_10.17.39.png" style="height:1634px;width:1179px;" alt="I asked Meta AI to &quot;make it look like the cat is in space.&quot;" data-uuid="6c69a81e-1f01-42f4-8920-d88d2c4ca011"><figcaption>I asked Meta AI to &quot;make it look like the cat is in space.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Instagram</div></figure><p>The prompt bar can also be used to iterate on images without the &quot;add, change, remove&quot; constraints. It still takes a couple seconds for Meta AI to come up with its creations, but it’s an overall much faster and smoother experience than the company’s first “imagine” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-ai-image-generator-is-available-as-a-standalone-website-185953058.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">image generator</a> from nearly two years ago.</p><p>Meta has also added some preset effects that change the style of an entire image (e.g. anime, watercolor, 8-bit) without a prompt. There are also some presets specifically for &quot;short videos,&quot; according to Meta, though I&#39;m only seeing restyle options for photos for now.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Restyle_Flow_1.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Restyle_Flow_1.png" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="You can prompt Meta AI to edit your photos in Stories," data-uuid="1f6895c9-d7b7-489d-80ab-22b93ad7df00"><figcaption>You can prompt Meta AI to edit your photos in Stories,</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>Meta is also testing some &quot;restyle&quot; effects for text within Stories posts. This will allow people to mix things up from the same few font styles Instagram typically has available. Like with the image edits, you can ask Meta to customize the look of your words (e.g &quot;make it look like toy blocks&quot;).</p><p>The changes will make Meta AI&#39;s image and video editing features much more prominent to Instagram users, Meta AI has had the ability to change and restyle images <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-ai-can-now-talk-to-you-and-edit-your-photos-172853219.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">for some time</a>, but those features have been confined to chats with the Meta AI assistant. By now adding text-based prompts directly to Stories, these tools are a lot more accessible. Instagram is further encouraging users to share their new AI-inspired creations with a new &quot;add yours&quot; sticker that lets people share prompts others can iterate on.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-stories-is-getting-new-ai-powered-editing-tools-175500693.html?src=rss]]></description>

That seems to be the pitch behind Microsoft&#39;s new &quot;expressive, customizable and warm&quot; face of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-copilot-ai-gets-a-voice-and-the-ability-to-see-websites-you-browse-140030003.html">Copilot&#39;s voice mode</a>. The friendly blob listens, reacts and changes color in response to user interactions.</p>
<p>Microsoft sees Mico as an answer to what an &quot;AI companion&quot; looks like. The &quot;optional visual presence&quot; aims to listen and support without kissing ass. &quot;It will push back on you sometimes, but always respectfully,&quot; Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2025/10/23/human-centered-ai/">wrote</a> in a blog post.</p>

<p>Clippy — I mean, Mico — is also part of a new Copilot feature called Learn Live. The student-focused voice mode will have Mico act as a Socratic tutor that &quot;guides you through concepts instead of just giving answers.&quot; Its tools will include questions, visual cues and interactive whiteboards.</p>
<p><em>The Verge</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/804106/microsoft-mico-copilot-ai-assistant-clippy">reports</a> that Mico is only available in the US, UK and Canada at launch. The character is now being enabled by default for Copilot&#39;s voice mode.

<p><em>Assasin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2, Ubisoft announced today in its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Ubisoft;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cca828bc-bcd7-4319-b5fa-8cb88f52eae1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a23b61e9-78ec-4564-b07d-8670f13e7edc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ubisoft&amp;linkText=fall+roadmap+update&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi1jYS9nYW1lL2Fzc2Fzc2lucy1jcmVlZC9uZXdzLzZSYm1ZcnBzUDI0UEpZdFBscEoybVgvYXNzYXNzaW5zLWNyZWVkLXNoYWRvd3MtZmFsbC1yb2FkbWFwLXVwZGF0ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTIzYjYxZTktNzhlYy00NTY0LWIwN2QtODY3MGYxM2U3ZWRjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi1jYS9nYW1lL2Fzc2Fzc2lucy1jcmVlZC9uZXdzLzZSYm1ZcnBzUDI0UEpZdFBscEoybVgvYXNzYXNzaW5zLWNyZWVkLXNoYWRvd3MtZmFsbC1yb2FkbWFwLXVwZGF0ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfZL2O6bcX0HDJL927kj7zH7egJGlasKnS3M7HSnhbJu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fassassins-creed%2Fnews%2F6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">fall roadmap update</a>. The Switch 2 drop will include all of the game’s updates aside from the recent Claws of Awaji expansion, which will be added in 2026. It’ll also support cross-progression through Ubisoft Connect, allowing players to continue a current game on the new platform. The Switch 2 version of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will support a unique feature, too: touchscreen interactions in the menus, including the world map, store and hideout.</p>
<p>Ubisoft’s fall roadmap for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> has three major dates. On October 28, title update 10 will target the parkour system, adding an Advanced Parkour option and reintroducing the directional catch ledge mechanic, among other tweaks. This update will also add a new Animus themed activity called Corrupted Castles. Then, on November 25, Ubisoft will roll out a third story drop and a surprise collaboration. The new quest is called “A Puzzlement” and it’s sillier in tone than <em>Shadows</em> itself, “much more akin to something like <em>AC Odyssey</em>,” according to developers. In it, Naoe will learn a version of Yasuke’s war kick ability, and Yasuke will discover how to sneak-stun enemies. On December 2, the Switch 2 release caps off the roadmap.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Claws of Awaji expansion brought more than 10 hours of new content to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> in September, introducing new weapons, abilities, gear, enemy factions, bosses and story beats, plus a fresh region to explore. This will all come to the Switch 2 version of the game later in 2026.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An environmental watchdog group has suggested that millions of tons of discarded electronics from the US turn up in Asia and the Middle East each month, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/american-waste-causing-hidden-tsunami-southeast-asia-watchdog-126761306?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>ABC News</ins></em></a>. This has created a &quot;hidden tsunami&quot; of e-waste.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based Basel Action Network (BAN) conducted a two-year investigation into the matter and reportedly discovered at least ten US companies that exported used electronics to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia. This waste includes stuff like discarded phones and computers, which is an issue <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/electronic-waste-vietnam-recycling-workers-ewaste-fd437a066a967a3c8d2c8611a628c944"><ins>due to integrated toxic metals</ins></a> like lead, cadmium and mercury.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All told, around 2,000 containers of e-waste leave the US each month, totaling around 33,000 metric tons. The companies behind these shipments are described as &quot;e-waste brokers,&quot; as they don&#39;t recycle the waste themselves. Rather, they ship it off for someone else to deal with. These entities have names like Corporate eWaste Solutions, Semsotai, First America Metal Corp. and PPM Recycling.</p>
<p>The ten companies named in the report allegedly exported e-waste valued at over $1 billion between January of 2023 and February of 2025. Trade could top out at more than $200 million each month across the industry.</p>
<p>Semsotai has responded to the allegations, saying that it doesn&#39;t export scrap and only specializes in working components intended for reuse. It also accused BAN of bias. PPM Recycling accused BAN of exaggerating shipment volumes. Most of the companies named in the report, however, have chosen not to comment at this time.</p>
<p>The report also indicates that US e-waste shipments allegedly made up six percent of all US exports to Malaysia between the years 2023 to 2025. “Malaysia suddenly became this mecca of junk,” said Jim Puckett of BAN. Containers have also been tracked to Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and the UAE.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that global e-waste is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ewastemonitor.info/the-global-e-waste-monitor-2024/"><ins>growing five times quicker</ins></a> than recycling programs. The world produced 62 million metric tons of electronic waste in 2022, a number that&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/electronic-waste-kenya-united-nations-ewaste-environment-e37667e5a6b08fe8ef161d386eb3404d"><ins>expected to climb to 82 million by 2030</ins></a>. This is according to the United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union and its research arm, UNITAR</p>
<p>Most countries around the world have banned these kinds of imports <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-environmental-quality-and-transboundary-issues/basel-convention-on-hazardous-wastes/"><ins>under the Basel Convention</ins></a>, which is an international treaty addressing hazardous waste trade.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, Anthropic made Claude <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-can-now-reference-past-chats-if-you-want-it-to-211806343.html">capable of remembering past conversations</a>. With the update, people could reference specific chats, so that they wouldn&#39;t need to repeat themselves when revisiting a topic. Today, the company has begun out a new, enhanced memory feature set, with the included improvements coming to all paying users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of chatbots, including <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-can-now-remember-all-your-past-conversations-134642785.html">ChatGPT</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-advanced-can-now-recall-your-past-conversations-to-inform-its-responses-222407226.html">Gemini</a>, can remember past conversations, but Anthropic believes its implementation has a few legs up on the competition. For one, Claude will learn your preferences and work patterns over time, which Anthropic says will translate to the chatbot getting better at understanding how you work. Additionally, the company claims Claude is &quot;fully transparent&quot; about its memory, meaning users will see an &quot;actual synthesis&quot; of what it has recorded over time, instead of &quot;vague summaries.&quot; If you want to edit its memory, you can do so through conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9c58b760e80f482a86ade2c1993c6747"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PupmfSttxlc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the same, Anthropic has made it easy to compartmentalize the data Claude collects. When using the Projects feature to group conversations together, the chatbot will create a distinct memory space for each grouping. In this way, information Claude has saved from your work conversations won&#39;t bleed over to your personal chats, for example. If you&#39;re coming from ChatGPT or Gemini, Anthropic has  made it possible to import saved memories from those chatbots to Claude. You can also export any tidbits of context Claude saves to other AI platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of today&#39;s announcement, Anthropic notes it conducted extensive testing to determine if Claude&#39;s new capabilities would lead to greater sycophancy and more harmful conversations. &quot;Though this testing, we identified areas where Claude’s responses needed refinement and made targeted adjustments to how memory functions,&quot; the company said. &quot;These iterations helped us build and improve the memory feature in a way that allows Claude to provide helpful and safe responses to users.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Max subscribers can enable Claude new memory capabilities starting today, with availability for Pro users to follow in the coming days. The feature is fully optional, and won&#39;t be turned on unless you toggle it through the settings menu.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-can-now-compartmentalize-as-part-of-a-major-memory-upgrade-170000194.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People are evidently never buying quite enough stuff from Amazon to keep the company entirely happy, and it&#39;s calling on AI once again to push indecisive shoppers into locking down the purchase they’ve been eyeing up. The new tool, which Amazon calls <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-things-to-buy-help-me-decide-gen-ai"><ins>Help Me Decide</ins></a>, gives shoppers in the US personalized recommendations of products they should buy by analyzing their browsing history, searches and preferences.</p>
<p>It’s designed to &quot;help&quot; customers who have been looking at a number of products in a particular category, such as wireless headphones, to decide which one best suits their needs. The Help Me Decide button will pop up on a product detail page when it detects that you’ve been browsing for a while without making a final choice. If you choose to tap for AI assistance, it will pull together all the information it can find on your relevant shopping history and recommend the product it deems the right choice for you. It also recommends an alternative upgrade pick and a similar product for those on a budget.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Help Me Decide can also group together related searches. Amazon uses the example of the tool recommending an all-season tent for four people based on you previously looking for adult and kids’ sleeping bags that keep you warm, camping accessories and children’s hiking boots. The recommendation it chooses includes an explanation of why it’s the best pick for you based on its features and your previous purchases, and pulls in customer reviews to back it up. This suggests that how useful the recommendations are will ultimately come down to how much you take notice of customer reviews.</p>
<p>When searching for products to recommend to you, Help Me Decide leverages Amazon&#39;s Bedrock and SageMaker machine learning platforms, as well as its OpenSearch tool, to marry up all the different factors it takes into consideration. It follows the introduction of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-has-a-new-ai-powered-tool-for-shopping-125314016.html"><ins>Interests</ins></a> tool earlier this year, which uses AI to generate shopping results based on your natural language prompts. Back In May, the company also started <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-testing-ai-generated-hosts-that-talk-customers-through-product-features-153112886.html"><ins>experimenting</ins></a> with AI-generated hosts that can summarise products for you before you buy them, again relying heavily on customer reviews for its information.</p>
<p>Help Me Decide is live in the US now and can be found in the Amazon app (iOS and Android) and mobile browser. If you tap “Keep shopping for” it should show up, and will do the same on a product detail page after you’ve looked at a number of products in a related category.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-calls-on-ai-once-again-with-its-new-help-me-decide-shopping-tool-164516673.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The family of Adam Raine has filed an amended lawsuit against OpenAI. Raine died by suicide in April, and his family <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html">claims ChatGPT enabled the tragedy</a>. The updated lawsuit accuses the company of weakening self-harm safeguards in the period leading up to Raine&#39;s death, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/47b00423-1060-43c9-8c28-23631cb7a4d1"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. In addition, the company reportedly asked for a list of attendees and documents from Raine&#39;s memorial service.</p>
<p>The accusations in the amended lawsuit relate to GPT-4o, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-claims-that-its-free-gpt-4o-model-can-talk-laugh-sing-and-see-like-a-human-184249780.html">ChatGPT&#39;s default model</a> in the months before Raine&#39;s suicide. The suit says OpenAI removed crucial protections by instructing it not to &quot;change or quit the conversation&quot; when discussing self-harm. The filing claims the company &quot;truncated safety testing&quot; due to competitive pressures.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit reportedly says OpenAI weakened its guardrails again in February. At that point, the company allegedly instructed GPT-4o to &quot;take care in risky situations&quot; and &quot;try to prevent imminent real-world harm&quot; rather than refusing to engage on the subject. The filing adds that the model still had a series of &quot;disallowed content.&quot; Intellectual property rights and the manipulation of political opinions were said to be included. Suicide wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>In addition, <em>FT</em> reports that OpenAI requested a complete list of attendees at Adam Raine&#39;s memorial. The company asked for &quot;all documents relating to memorial services or events in the honour of the decedent including but not limited to any videos or photographs taken, or eulogies given...  as well as invitation or attendance lists or guestbooks.&quot;</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Raine family described the request as &quot;unusual&quot; and &quot;intentional harassment.&quot; They speculated that OpenAI would subpoena &quot;everyone in Adam’s life.&quot;</p>
<p>Engadget reached out to OpenAI for comment. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back. After the initial lawsuit was reported, the company acknowledged GPT-4o&#39;s shortcomings in some distressing situations. OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-adding-parental-controls-to-chatgpt-144128085.html">introduced ChatGPT parental controls</a> soon after. In addition, it&#39;s exploring a system to identify teen users and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/following-teen-suicide-openai-explores-automatic-underage-user-restrictions-151948711.html?guccounter=1">automatically restrict their usage</a>. The company says <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html">GPT-5</a>, the current default, is updated to better handle signs of distress.</p>
<p>Raine&#39;s parents, Matthew and Maria Raine, claim Adam&#39;s use of ChatGPT shot up dramatically after the model&#39;s February updates. They say that, in January, he only had a few dozen chats with the model, 1.6 percent of which referred to self-harm. But they claim that in April, his use rose to 300 chats daily, with 17 percent regarding self-harm.</p>
<p>The Raines first sued OpenAI in August.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently, web browsers are cool again. Two days after <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas-launches-on-macos-today-170735742.html">OpenAI launched its AI browser</a>, Microsoft has some updates for its Edge&#39;s AI mode. (Fancy that!) Copilot Mode, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-trials-copilot-mode-in-edge-201851903.html">introduced in July</a>, now has several features that were teased at launch.</p>
<p>First up: Copilot Actions, which is Microsoft&#39;s branding for AI-assisted, multi-step tasks. This feature is already <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/labs/experiments/copilot-actions">available</a> in the standard version of Copilot, but it&#39;s now being previewed for Edge&#39;s Copilot Mode. Microsoft&#39;s examples of Copilot Actions in Edge include unsubscribing from email newsletters or making a restaurant reservation.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another new (but previously announced) feature is Journeys. These are saved projects you can return to anytime. &quot;Remember that project you started a while back, but life got in the way?&quot; Microsoft&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/?p=26061">blog post</a> asks. &quot;No need to bookmark all those tabs.&quot; For example, if you&#39;re researching starting a business, Copilot can recap articles you&#39;ve read, suggest next steps and resurface a tutorial video you watched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a video from when Microsoft teased Journeys in July.</p>
<div id="6c8fae1578f74a3e91137378aee8f0de"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIckzrxpwtk?si=U7z7R4bMwdbXYy1_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Along similar lines, another new Copilot Mode feature is the option to let the assistant access your browsing history. One example Microsoft gives is chatting with Copilot about a clothing item you checked out last week. Or, ask it for movie recommendations based on content you previously liked.</p>
<p>Copilot requires explicit permission to access your private data for these new features. Microsoft&#39;s blog post stresses that your browser data is protected under the company&#39;s privacy statement and that Copilot &quot;only collects what&#39;s needed to improve your experience.&quot; The company also notes that you&#39;ll see clear visual cues so you know when Copilot is active.</p>
<p>Still, these features require loads of private information to be useful. Don&#39;t grant those permissions without first giving it some serious thought.</p>
<p>The new Copilot features are currently free in a US-only &quot;limited preview.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-makes-edges-copilot-mode-a-bit-smarter-160031147.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll have to wait a bit longer than expected to explore the Lands Between on Nintendo Switch 2. FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have delayed <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition </em>— the Switch 2 version of the massively successful action RPG — until 2026. The port was announced back in April and it was originally slated to arrive sometime this year.</p><p>&quot;While development on #ELDENRING Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a post</a> on the Elden Ring X account reads. &quot;We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.&quot;</p><p>Players got their first taste of the port during public demos at Gamescom in August, but performance issues were evident. At the time, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>IGN</em></a><em> </em>described the game as a &quot;disaster&quot; in the Switch 2&#39;s handheld mode, citing &quot;significant&quot; frame rate drops and a &quot;confusing&quot; button layout. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> saw &quot;multiple instances of frame drops and stuttering while out in the open world.&quot; So, taking extra time to make sure <em>Elden Ring </em>runs as smoothly as possible on the Switch 2 seems wise.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tarnished Edition includes the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/even-fromsoftware-agrees-elden-rings-dlc-was-too-difficult-153725812.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> expansion as well as new classes, weapons, armor and customization options for your horse, Torrent (other versions of the game will get these additions as well). FromSoftware is also working on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-switch-2-2026-release-142025792.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, a Switch 2 exclusive that&#39;s slated to arrive in 2026 as well.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2-version-of-elden-ring-is-delayed-until-2026-154500911.html?src=rss]]></description>
