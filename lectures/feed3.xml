Some photographers want a compact mirrorless camera that travels easily. Others want an action cam that can handle rough hikes, or a full-frame system that delivers the best possible image quality. With so many options today, there is a camera built for almost every creative style.<br><br>We tested the top models across categories to help you decide which one fits your needs. Whether you are filming your first vlog, shooting portraits or capturing fast-moving action, these are the best cameras to help you grow your skills.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-best-mirrorless-cameras">Best mirrorless cameras</h3> 
<p>Mirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyPKBBeHy6k&amp;t=1s">video</a>. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h3 id="jump-link-best-action-camera-or-gimbal-camera">Best action camera or gimbal camera</h3> 
<p>The most important features to look for in an action cam are image quality, stabilization and battery life. GoPro has easily been beating all rivals recently in all those areas, but DJI has taken a lot of its business with the Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-best-compact-camera">Best compact camera</h3> 
<p>This category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p> 
<p>Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-camera">What to consider before choosing a camera</h2> 
<p>Though smartphones get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sensor-size">Sensor size</h3> 
<p>There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.</p> 
<p>Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject&#39;s eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult.</p> 
<p>The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm&#39;s X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It&#39;s cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it&#39;s ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.</p> 
<p>Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.</p> 
<p>The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That&#39;s used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-autofocus">Autofocus</h3> 
<p>For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-displays">Displays</h3> 
<p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenses">Lenses</h3> 
<p>DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you&#39;re stuck with what&#39;s built into a compact camera. While that&#39;s great for portability, a single lens means you&#39;re going to sacrifice <em>something</em> along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it&#39;s slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens.</p> 
<p>When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-video-recording">Video recording</h3> 
<p>When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.</p> 
<p>In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it&#39;s preferable to have both.) How&#39;s the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG just revealed several new speakers in the xboom line <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-121511445.html"><ins>ahead of CES 2026</ins></a>. These speakers are part of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-xboom-speakers-hands-on-built-with-the-help-of-william-and-a-dash-of-ai-170030904.html"><ins>an ongoing collaboration</ins></a> with will.i.am from Black Eyed Peas, who is on board as the &quot;experimental architect&quot; involved with &quot;development, design and brand marketing.&quot;</p>
<p>These speakers are fairly different from one another, but they all have AI in common. Each speaker includes an algorithm that automatically adjusts the EQ after analyzing the audio content and the listening space. Many also feature an AI algorithm for ambient lighting, which will adjust the lights to match the song being played.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The xboom Stage 501 is intended for parties and karaoke sessions. It features additional AI that can remove vocals from &quot;virtually any song&quot; and even adjust the pitch. The battery lasts for around 25 hours and can operate while plugged in. The speaker delivers up to 220W of power, with dual woofers and full-range drivers. It boasts a five-sided cabinet design that allows for vertical and horizontal placement.</p>

<p>The xboom Blast is a boombox with a 99Wh battery that allows for up to 35 hours of continuous playback. That&#39;s a mighty fine metric. This is a modern boombox, so it&#39;s designed for durability. There are edge bumpers and a side rope handle for carrying.</p>

<p>The Mini is a tiny doodad that can be placed just about anywhere. It offers ten hours of battery life per charge and a strap for easy placement. The speaker also includes a built-in tripod mount.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/4d20b8c0-e5a5-11f0-8ffb-33faf0a0ccd3" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/4d20b8c0-e5a5-11f0-8ffb-33faf0a0ccd3" style="height:752px;width:1196px;" alt="A speaker." data-uuid="951c15c3-09a6-3a08-b458-06f4e97b5b8d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure>
<p>The Rock is a, well, rock-shaped speaker that&#39;s larger than the Mini but can still be held in the palm of the hand. The battery lasts for ten hours and the design is focused on durability. It has been tested to &quot;seven military standards&quot; to ensure reliability in &quot;challenging outdoor environments.&quot; This is an upgrade of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/lg-xboom-go-xg2t-review"><ins>pre-existing XG2 model</ins></a>.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have pricing or exact availability on this stuff yet, though the speakers will be on display at LG&#39;s booth at CES. The company has said that all four of these gadgets will come out in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html?src=rss]]></description>

(Take, for example, its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/next-gen-snapdragon-g-series-chips-will-power-handhelds-from-ayaneo-onexsugar-and-retroid-pocket-131733930.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">transforming dual-screen gaming portable</a>.) Its latest venture is another retro gaming handheld that, at first glance, looks like a standard dual-screen model. But the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet uses a single foldable screen instead.</p><p>The device was teased via a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eyvWBVE3y/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">54-second video</a> on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. <em>Retro Handhelds</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/onexsugar-wallet-is-first-android-handheld-with-a-foldable-screen/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reports</a> that the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. (That&#39;s a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded.) The video also shows an asymmetrical analog stick layout with a D-pad and four action buttons.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/onex_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/onex_2.jpg" style="height:1426px;width:2535px;" alt="Straight-on view of a retro gaming handheld" data-uuid="998b30ba-8388-4d4e-9d0a-bc6e14a6c52c"><figcaption>OneXSugar Fold</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OneXPlayer / Bilibi</div></figure><p>Given foldable phones’ <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-motorola-razr-cnet-fold-test.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">long-term durability concerns</a>, we aren&#39;t necessarily betting on the OneXSugar Wallet being a wise purchase.

In its worst-case-scenario model, the IDC predicts PC shipments could shrink by up to 8.9 percent in 2026 because of the high cost of memory.</p><p>&quot;Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5,&quot; IDC writes. That&#39;s continued to drive up the price of the RAM that is available for PC makers, which has naturally led to them to raise the price of their own products to stay above water. For example, modular PC maker Framework has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://frame.work/blog/in-stock-on-framework-desktop-and-updates-on-the-industry-wide-silicon-crunch" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">had to raise prices</a> on some of its laptops and parts, and says &quot;further cost and price increases are highly likely over the next months.&quot; The IDC says prices could rise by 6 to 8 percent in 2026 if its most pessimistic scenario comes true.</p><p>The timing of this RAM crunch is particularly ironic because selling <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">&quot;AI PCs&quot;</a> — computers with neural processing units that can run AI models locally — were supposed to be one of the things pulling the PC industry out of its post-pandemic slump. Instead, those computers&#39; larger RAM needs leave them more vulnerable to the effects of the AI industry itself. Computers aren&#39;t the only electronics impacted, either. The IDC says the average selling price of a smartphone could grow by 6 to 8 percent in its most pessimistic scenario, and smartphone shipments could shrink by as much as 5.2 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like Apple and Samsung, with cash to spare and long-term supply agreements, could weather these higher RAM prices and keep things consistent for a year or two, according to the IDC. For everyone else, though, the near-term is looking much more expensive, and by necessity, much less adventurous.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss]]></description>

But at CES 2025, the China-based company showed its high-end chops with a massive <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/hisense-introduces-its-first-ever-consumer-microled-tv-194057452.html"><ins>136-inch micro LED TV,</ins></a> which recently became available for a whopping <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9486b306-eae4-49da-a805-9b5cf78d2fb9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;linkText=%24100%2C000&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXN0YnV5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2hpc2Vuc2UtMTM2LWNsYXNzLW14LW1pY3JvLWxlZC1zZXJpZXMtdWhkLTRrLXZpZGFhLXR2LXNtYXJ0LWRpc3BsYXktMjAyNS9KM1o5WjQyNjlZIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NDg2YjMwNi1lYWU0LTQ5ZGEtYTgwNS05YjVjZjc4ZDJmYjkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc3RidXkuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QvaGlzZW5zZS0xMzYtY2xhc3MtbXgtbWljcm8tbGVkLXNlcmllcy11aGQtNGstdmlkYWEtdHYtc21hcnQtZGlzcGxheS0yMDI1L0ozWjlaNDI2OVkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ89t0paqxpwATdjqp9az6PvRx_kS7XVPyg75kpghW87&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fhisense-136-class-mx-micro-led-series-uhd-4k-vidaa-tv-smart-display-2025%2FJ3Z9Z4269Y" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/hisense-136-class-mx-micro-led-series-uhd-4k-vidaa-tv-smart-display-2025/J3Z9Z4269Y"><ins>$100,000</ins></a>. So what&#39;s on deck for this year&#39;s show? New leadership, for starters.</p>
<p>The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-to-appoint-james-fishler-to-c-suite-as-the-company-strengthens-its-u-s-strategy-ahead-o"><ins>press release</ins></a>, Hisense said Fishler&#39;s experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company &quot;builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense&#39;s presentation and how you can watch it.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch">How to watch</h2>
<p>Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/ces-2026">its website</a>. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/exclusive-hisense-is-betting-on-rgb-tvs-to-shake-up-the-industry-and-make-rivals-nervous"><ins>Tom&#39;s Guide</ins></a>, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.</p>
<p>As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html"><ins>Samsung</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html"><ins>LG</ins></a> have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung will have two new inexpensive mobile devices <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-welcomes-galaxy-a17-5g-galaxy-tab-a11-galaxy-ecosystem/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">arriving</a> on the US market next month. The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7. Arriving on January 8, the Galaxy Tab A11+ will retail for $250.&nbsp;</p><p>The Galaxy A17 5G has a 6.7” FHD+ Super AMOLED display and is powered by the same Exynos 1330 chip found in the Galaxy A16 5G. The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD. Its 5,000mAh battery also supports fast-charging, a feature we&#39;re <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">happy to see</a> becoming more of an industry standard this year. Essentially, this is more of the same from Samsung, but this product line has a solid legacy of decent smartphones that don&#39;t break the bank. Don&#39;t be surprised if this joins our lineup of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best budget Android phones</a> come 2026.</p><p>The other new entry-level device is the Galaxy Tab A11+, which boasts an 11-inch LCD display. The rear camera is 8MP and the front one is 5MP. It has an option for 6GB of RAM with 128GB in storage, or for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here. There are many swankier tablets on the market these days, but if you&#39;re looking for a bare-bones option, this Samsung offering is a solid consideration.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-unveils-its-new-200-galaxy-a17-5g-smartphone-arriving-in-january-184846560.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow&#39;s the big day, and I don&#39;t just mean New Year&#39;s Eve. The series finale of <em>Stranger Things</em> airs tomorrow, and Netflix has released a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQ13jsLDms">trailer for the last episode</a>. We&#39;re given only flashes of the final episode, along with a voiceover of an emotional Jim Hopper telling Eleven he needs her to fight one last time.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just over 1 minute and 30 seconds long, with what appears to be only about 30 seconds of new footage. There isn&#39;t much to go on here, as most of the footage features emotional moments from seasons past. Netflix no doubt is hoping to keep much of the excitement under wraps until tomorrow&#39;s premiere.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><strong>Warning: Some spoilers ahead for </strong><strong><em>Stranger Things</em></strong><strong> season 5.</strong></p>
<div id="42ea55a6ccb3466f988f3cb9b46a8dff"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AfQ13jsLDms?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Among the new images we briefly see Vecna, hooked up to the ceiling in his gross cave of power on his other world. There&#39;s also an explosion at what looks like a military site, plus a few more out-of-context flashes of our heroes.</p>
<p>One particularly ominous moment shows Hopper walking around a smoke-filled room with almost zero visibility, gun drawn, when we see what looks to be Vecna appear behind him. We also see Eleven climb back into the sensory-deprivation tank in the Upside Down, presumably to take the fight to the show’s big bad.</p>
<p>The only continuous scene in the trailer shows most of the gang standing atop a radio tower as Vecna&#39;s world moves close enough to collide with the tower&#39;s tip. Dustin lets out a &quot;mother of God&quot; as the so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme the group cooked up in Chapter Seven appears to be well underway.</p>
<p>After nine years and five seasons, we will finally reach a conclusion for the heroes of Hawkins. The episode premieres at 8PM ET (5PM PT). For those still craving more from the world of Hawkins after the finale, Netflix is releasing a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-first-trailer-for-the-animated-stranger-things-spin-off-is-here-172128527.html">Stranger Things animated series</a> in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-has-released-a-trailer-for-the-stranger-things-finale-171204480.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If cleaning up your digital life is on your New Year's resolution list, we've got good news: 1Password is offering <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100230748-17201697?sid=us-engadget">half off its subscription plans</a> (both the Individual and Families plans). That brings the price of the Individual plan down to $24 for a year and the Families plan down to $36 for a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plans are nearly identical, but the Families plan accommodates five additional people. These discounts are only available to new customers and the prices expire after the year, so set a reminder to cancel or reassess. And you'll need to act fast, because <strong>the offer expires today — Tuesday, December 30.</strong></p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><core-commerce id="5f0785972453445e8267b8ce9c1fc5fc" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p>
<p>This provider topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/best-password-manager-134639599.html">best password managers</a>, and for good reason. We appreciated the intuitive interface and the fact that it's available on most platforms, so you'll never be left out in the cold. These include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and more.</p>
<p>Subscriptions include industry standard encryption and a "secret key" that only you know on top of a master password. There's also two-factor authentication and the platform issues alerts when credentials have potentially been compromised.</p>
<p>1Password recently raised prices across the board, but this is still looking to be the best deal for our favorite password manager going into the new year. The only downside here is the one that accompanies many password managers: There is no free version.&nbsp;</p>

It&#39;s reportedly one of the largest acquisitions yet involving a startup nurtured in China&#39;s AI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manus arrived in March 2025, shortly after another Chinese AI startup, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/engadget-podcast-deepseek-blows-up-the-ai-world-123036730.html">DeepSeek</a> appeared on the scene. The company (called Butterfly Effect at the time) originally described it as &quot;the first general AI agent&quot; to perform complex tasks autonomously, rather than just generating ideas. It draws from several third-party models, particularly Anthropic&#39;s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and versions of Alibaba&#39;s Qwen.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Manus is designed to automate certain tasks, like market research, coding, sales data analysis and website cloning and creation. (However, one skeptic <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1898712333544812626">called it</a> &quot;a product devilishly optimized for influencers, which is why it exploded so much.&quot;) The company claims that Manu is &quot;already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses&quot; and has an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million only eight months after launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manus laid off most of its Beijing employees this summer before moving its headquarters to Singapore in an effort to expand globally.The company was reportedly seeking a funding round that would have valued it at $2 billion when it was approached by Meta. &quot;Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,&quot; said Manus CEO Xiao Hong in a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://manus.im/blog/manus-joins-meta-for-next-era-of-innovation">company news release</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-buys-startup-known-for-its-ai-task-automation-agents-140045275.html?src=rss]]></description>

The TCL Note A1 NXTPAPER is the company&#39;s latest device to use <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-lcd-paper-color-video-price-specs-availability-tab-10s-5g-160025391.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">NXTPAPER</a>, TCL&#39;s custom paper-like LCD screen, which offers some of the qualities of E Ink without the limitations.</p><p>TCL says the 11.5-inch color &quot;NXTPAPER Pure&quot; display on the Note A1 has a 2,200 x 1,440 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which should mean it looks clearer and feels much smoother to interact with than the color E Ink screen used on something like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reMarkable Paper Pro</a>. The tablet supports TCL&#39;s T-Pen Pro for taking notes and drawing on the screen, but also features eight built-in microphones for recording and transcribing audio. The Note A1 also has a 13-megapixel camera for scanning documents, an 8,000mAh battery and 256GB of storage, with the option to access cloud services like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive if you want it.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TCL-Note-A1-NXTPAPER-bento.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TCL-Note-A1-NXTPAPER-bento.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A diagram of different Note A1 NXTPAPER features arranged in a grid." data-uuid="9bc06d6f-e801-4705-986e-42c1f2b210f2"/><figcaption>A diagram of different Note A1 NXTPAPER features arranged in a grid.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>Unlike TCL&#39;s past NXTPAPER tablets, the Note A1 doesn&#39;t prioritize media consumption — it&#39;s a productivity tool first and foremost. TCL says the device runs Android, but hasn&#39;t shared whether it&#39;ll have access to the Play Store. All the features the company has announced focus on taking notes and using AI to process and organize whatever you&#39;ve written down. The device will also support real-time translation and &quot;handwriting beautification,&quot; among a collection of other AI-powered features. </p><p>Engadget has reached out to TCL for more information on the Note A1 NXTPAPER&#39;s software. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>There will likely never be one “Goldilocks” version of these note-taking devices, but the Note A1 NXTPAPER&#39;s combination of display and microphones does make it an intriguing, if limited, alternative to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/booxs-new-go-7-e-ink-tablets-support-handwriting-with-a-46-stylus-182026839.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Boox&#39;s E Ink tablets</a>. Anyone interested in TCL&#39;s new device won&#39;t have to wait long to try it, either.&nbsp;</p><p>The TCL Note A1 NXTPAPER is available to order now through Kickstarter (with additional bonuses and discounts) and will officially go on sale for $549 at the end of February.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/tcl-introduces-its-own-take-on-a-color-kindle-scribe-140000207.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-announced-at-its-ces-2025-keynote-174947827.html"><ins>its RTX 5000-series GPUs</ins></a> and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidias-spark-desktop-ai-supercomputer-arrives-this-summer-200351998.html"><ins>Spark</ins></a>).

<p>But don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not on the ground in Vegas. Here&#39;s how you can watch the livestream of the company&#39;s January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.</p>

<p>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NVIDIA;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4a8ad1a0-9035-4f52-a4e0-783ee7c9700b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;linkText=NVIDIA%27s+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2V2ZW50cy9jZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YThhZDFhMC05MDM1LTRmNTItYTRlMC03ODNlZTdjOTcwMGIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm52aWRpYS5jb20vZW4tdXMvZXZlbnRzL2Nlcy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR26TWBottpAVLkSWGEW61EoLzbnApNs7qzQl5JGh6Ef&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fevents%2Fces%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/"><ins>NVIDIA&#39;s website</ins></a> (and likely on YouTube as well). We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>NVIDIA&#39;s game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including  &quot;cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.&quot; It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we&#39;re unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.</p>
<p>Given <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-worth-much-german-economy-133045033.html"><ins>NVIDIA&#39;s sky-high valuation</ins></a> and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html"><ins>increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers</ins></a> – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang&#39;s remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company&#39;s Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA&#39;s partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang&#39;s presentation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-presentation-live-130028065.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CES 2026 is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html">right around the corner</a>, and the pre-show hype cycle/ early reveals suggest, yes, there’s going to be an awful lot of AI-powered insert-product-category-here alongside, thankfully, some major announcements from the likes of Intel, Sony and NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Intel is finally unveiling its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips. The first chips built on Intel’s 2nm process could offer a 50 percent performance boost, which is sorely needed amid intense competition. NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang is taking the stage for a keynote expected to feature a lot of AI hype, while AMD’s Lisa Su will likely counter with new Ryzen 9000-series chips and the latest on AI upscaling tech.</p>

<p>Over the years, CES has consistently been <em>the</em> show for TV innovation and heady next-gen displays. This year, we’ll be talking a lot about Micro RGB. LG is introducing a new Micro RGB Evo panel with over 1,000 dimming zones, while Samsung plans to launch a full range of Micro RGB TVs from 55 inches to 115 inches. In 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. The company has trademarked “True RGB,” which could become what Sony calls its spin on RGB displays.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering all the keynotes, press conferences and big reveals in person. And figuring which of the 100s of AI-branded devices and gadgets are worth reporting on.</p>
<p>I’m also taking bets on the most niche celebrity appearance/endorsement at CES 2026. We’ve seen 50 Cent, Big Bird, Martha Stewart, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Guillermo del Toro, Justin Bieber and will.i.am (<em>multiple</em> times), so who will join this pantheon of stars?</p>

<p>It isn’t just TVs with Samsung. The company has already teased a pair of new understated speakers. Likely inspired by the Samsung Frame, the new Wi-Fi speakers, called the Music Studio 5 and 7, blend into your living room. The Music Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, with a built-in waveguide to deliver better sound. The Music Studio 7 comes with a 3.1.1-channel spatial audio with top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers. No prices yet. Expect to hear more at CES itself or once the speakers arrive in stores. And as the press image above suggests, we can&#39;t wait to sit stoically in front of one, with a glass of water (?).</p>

<p>Xiaomi’s latest smartphone is once again a spec beast. It features a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. And it also has an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring. This surrounds the rear camera unit.</p>
<p>Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness.</p>
<p>But the camera features are the standout elements. The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well, Leica touches: a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on the front, textured edges and film simulations, like Leica’s Monopan 50 black and white. Xiaomi says the zoom ring “[eliminates] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm.” It can also be reprogrammed for manual focus.</p>
<p>Xiaomi’s 17 Ultra by Leica and the regular 17 Ultra start at CNY 7,999 ($1,140) and CNY 6,999 ($995), on par with the latest high-end Pixel 10s and Galaxy S25s.</p>

<p>A Google support page in Hindi indicates the ability to change your Gmail address might be coming. The feature would allow you to replace your current @gmail.com address with another. Your old address would remain active as an alias on the account, and all your data would stick around, unaffected. The support page (translated) says “the ability to change your Google Account email address is gradually rolling out to all users.”</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-why-do-i-need-an-ipad-case">Why do I need an iPad case?</h2> 
<p>It’s almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it’s protected against hazards and accidents. The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">best iPads</a> are expensive — even the most affordable model will set you back at least $300 — so you’ll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-an-ipad-case-and-an-ipad-cover">What is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover?</h3> 
<p>All iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers — yes, it’s a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-often-should-i-charge-my-ipad">How often should I charge my iPad?</h3> 
<p>How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a rudderless year and an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-may-lose-close-to-4000-employees-after-latest-deferred-resignation-round-204452249.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">exodus of around 4,000 employees</a> due to Trump administration cuts, NASA got what may be its first piece of good news recently. On December 17, the Senate <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">confirmed billionaire Jared Isaacman</a> as the agency&#39;s new administrator. He now holds the power to rehabilitate a battered engine of scientific research, or steer it towards even more disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the caliber of President Trump&#39;s other appointees, Isaacman is probably the best candidate for the job. Outside of being a successful entrepreneur, he has flown fighter jets and been to space twice as part of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Inspiration4</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/polaris-dawn-is-finally-headed-to-space-for-its-groundbreaking-civilian-mission-093346616.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Polaris Dawn</a> private missions. One of those flights saw him <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-polaris-dawn-crew-is-back-on-earth-after-a-historic-mission-142028997.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">complete the first commercial space walk</a>, and travel farther from Earth than any human since the end of the Apollo program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Perfect is the enemy of the good. Isaacman checks a lot of boxes,&quot; says Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and the founder of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://nasawatch.com/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">NASA Watch, a blog dedicated to the agency.</a> &quot;He&#39;s passed every requirement to fly in a spacecraft that American astronauts at NASA are required to pass. He also went out of his way to have a diverse crew, and shove as much science as he could in those missions.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>And yet if you&#39;re a NASA employee or just someone who cares about the agency&#39;s work, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned for its future. When Trump first nominated Isaacman in the spring, the billionaire wrote a 62-page document detailing his vision for NASA. In November, <em>Politico</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/jared-isaacman-confidential-manifesto-nasa-00633858" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">obtained a copy of that plan</a>, titled Project Athena.</p><p>To some insiders, Project Athena painted a picture of someone who, at least at the time when it was written, fundamentally misunderstood how NASA works and how scientific discovery is funded in the US and elsewhere. It also suggests Isaacman may be more open to Trump&#39;s NASA agenda than would appear at first glance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the plan by <em>Politico</em>, one former NASA official characterized it as &quot;bizarre and careless.&quot; Another called it “presumptuous,&quot; given many of the proposed changes to the agency&#39;s structure would require Congressional approval. In one section, Isaacman recommended taking “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and [leaving] it for academia to determine.” In another section, he promised to evaluate the “relevance and ongoing necessity” of every agency center, particularly NASA&#39;s iconic Jet Propulsion Laboratory, saying the facility and others must increase the “output and time to science KPI.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot has changed since Isaacman first wrote that document. It came before the workforce cuts, before the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">future of Goddard Space Flight Center</a> became uncertain and before Trump surprised everyone by renominating Isaacman. But <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-confirmation-hearing" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">during his Senate testimony</a> earlier this month, the billionaire said “I do stand behind everything in the document, even though it was written seven months ago. I think it was all directionally correct.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He did appear to distance himself from some viewpoints expressed in or inferred by Project Athena, however. Isaacman stated that “anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue.” He also came out against the administration&#39;s plan to cut NASA&#39;s science budget nearly in half, claiming the proposals would <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://spacenews.com/isaacman-calls-potential-nasa-science-cuts-not-optimal/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">not lead to &quot;an optimal outcome.&quot;</a></p><p>One thing is clear, Isaacman is not your typical bureaucrat. &quot;One of the pitfalls of some prior NASA administrators has been that they&#39;ve shown too much reverence for the internal processes and bureaucratic structure of the agency to the detriment of decision-making and performance,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.planetary.org/profiles/casey-dreier" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">said Casey Drier</a>, chief of space policy at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.planetary.org/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">The Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &quot;Isaacman has positioned himself as the opposite of that. Clearly, that&#39;s something that could lead to a lot of political and congressional challenges if taken too far.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if Isaacman doesn&#39;t follow through on any of the proposals made in Project Athena, there&#39;s only so much a NASA administrator — even one sympathetic to civil servants working under them — can do.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once a budget request goes out publicly, everyone in the administration has to defend it. Anything he does will have to be internal and private,&quot; Drier explains. &quot;He never explicitly criticized the administration during his hearing. He&#39;s also coming relatively late in the budget process.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of NASA&#39;s future will depend on the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for implementing the president&#39;s agenda across the executive branch. As a direct result of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-does-the-updated-omb-circular-a-11-mean-for-how-congress-appropriates-funding/" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">guidance</a> the OMB issued over the summer, NASA <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.planetary.org/charts/fy-2025-nasas-rate-of-new-grants" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">awarded 25 percent fewer new grants</a> in 2025 than it did on average between 2020 and 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The OMB has added layers of requirements that scientists now have to go through to spend the money they&#39;ve already been allocated. The administration has worked against its own stated goals of efficiency,&quot; Drier said. &quot;Isaacman can&#39;t solve that himself. He can&#39;t tell the OMB what to do. That&#39;s going to be a serious challenge.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Looming over everything is the fact NASA still does not have a full-year budget for 2026. Congress has until January 30 to fund NASA and the rest of the federal government before the short-term funding bill it passed on November 12 runs out. &quot;On paper, the official policy of the administration is still to terminate a third of NASA&#39;s scientific capability,&quot; Drier points out.</p><p>There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Publicly, both the House and Senate have come out against Trump&#39;s funding cuts. And some science missions that were slated to be cancelled, such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">OSIRIS-APEX</a>, have been approved for another full year of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What NASA needs now is someone who will, as Drier puts it, &quot;vigorously advocate&quot; for the agency in whatever way they can. It remains to be seen if that&#39;s Jared Isaacman.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>For years, LG has kicked off CES press day with the first event of the morning — and 2026 will be no different.

<p>Like nearly all tech-centric events these days, expect AI to be the binding theme of the LG presentation at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html">CES 2026</a>. Just be aware that, like Apple, LG has its own customized abbreviation for AI: &quot;Affectionate Intelligence.&quot; The company will share &quot;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences.&quot; In other words, the company is aiming for its devices to become more connected and self-automated than ever. Here&#39;s how you can stream it and what you can expect.</p>

The digital video game platform was started by CD Projekt in 2008 with a stated mission to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gogs-preservation-label-highlights-classic-games-its-maintaining-for-modern-hardware-231606454.html"><ins>preserve</ins></a> &quot;Good Old Games&quot; (hence the GOG acronym). CD Projekt is known for its game studio CD Projekt Red, the developers <em>The Witcher</em> series and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>GOG said Kiciński bought 100 percent of its shares for PLN 90.7 million ($25 million). The acquisition was fully financed through committed funding secured at the sale’s closing and did not involve the sale of any of Kiciński’s CD Projekt shares.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The storefront will continue to operate independently under its new owner, sticking with its DRM-free philosophy and ongoing work to keep classic titles playable on modern PCs. After the sale, CD Projekt and GOG signed a distribution agreement that will see CD Projekt Red games continue to be listed on GOG.</p>
<p>While the press release for the sale did not list a reason, a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-20-2025/"><ins>report</ins></a> posted Monday under the Regulatory Announcements section of the CD Projekt website states &quot;the sale of shares in GOG is consistent with the CD PROJEKT Group growth strategy, which assumes focusing on the core business of the Company, i.e., developing and publishing video games and related projects based on the owned and new franchises.&quot; The report also describes a &quot;competitive sale process,&quot; implying that Kiciński may not have been the only bidder.</p>
<p>While it seems Kiciński will have a hands-on role in GOG after its acquisition, his current involvement at CD Projekt is less clear. He remains a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/shareholders/"><ins>significant shareholder</ins></a> but is not listed on the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/capital-group/management-board/"><ins>Management board</ins></a> or its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/capital-group/supervisory-board/"><ins>Supervisory board</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/co-founder-of-cd-projekt-micha%C5%82-kicinski-has-acquired-gog-the-companys-game-storefront-174853415.html?src=rss]]></description>

As of Sunday, December 28, the <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;slk:status page;cpos:2;pos:1">status page</a> on <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>'s website still shows "unplanned outage" on all servers across PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p>Later that evening, though, the company confirmed that it was done testing on the update it pushed out and was opening the severs back up to players. It also said that the transaction rollback was complete, but that the Marketplace would remain closed for the time being.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">➡️ Our live tests are now complete and we are opening the game to all players. Please note that you may experience a queue when connecting, as our services ramp up.<br> <br>➡️ The rollback is also complete.<br>🔸 Players who did not log in between December 27th 10:49 UTC and December 29th… <a href="https://t.co/mfaAVnvK5G">https://t.co/mfaAVnvK5G</a></p>— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005461926793355523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The fiasco began Saturday morning when Ubisoft <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808?s=20" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;slk:said on X;cpos:3;pos:1">said on X</a> that they were "aware of an incident currently affecting <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>" and "working on a resolution." A couple of hours later, the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> servers were shut down, following plenty of <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004901721336590703?s=20" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;slk:user reports;cpos:4;pos:1">user reports</a> showing either zero or billions in R6 credits, rare skins in their lockers and either account bans or unbans. Ubisoft later clarified Saturday afternoon <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?s=20" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;slk:on X;cpos:5;pos:1">on X</a> that nobody would be banned if they spent their ill-gotten credits, but that a rollback of all transactions starting from Saturday, 6AM ET would soon be underway.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, Ubisoft informed the playerbase that they're currently performing a rollback, but that "extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes." The company added that "this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed" and didn't provide an estimate for when servers would be back online.</p><p><strong>Update, December 29, 2025, 10:22AM ET: </strong>This story and its headline have been updated with the details about Ubisoft re-opening the game’s servers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rainbow-six-siege-servers-are-back-online-after-shutting-down-in-response-to-marketplace-hacks-191049079.html?src=rss]]></description>

The aim is for Google Photos to work seamlessly with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-vision-ai-companion-bringing-conversational-ai-to-households-worldwide"><ins>Vision AI Companion</ins></a>, Samsung&#39;s souped-up version of Bixby. This would help to make user photos part of the day-to-day TV experience, with photos appearing while navigating the TV&#39;s OS during &quot;contextual and convenient moments.&quot;</p>
<p>The company says users will be able to explore their Google Photos libraries in three new experiences. The first is called Memories, and will show curated stories based on &quot;people, locations and meaningful moments.&quot; This has a planned launch in March 2026 and will be exclusive to Samsung TVs for six months.</p>

Users will also be able to turn any still image into a short video using the tool. Create with AI has a planned launch in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>Finally, Personalized Results will create themed slideshows of users&#39; photos based on particular topics or the content of an image. Examples given by Samsung include the ocean, hiking and Paris. This also has a planned launch in the latter part of 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Longtime CES observers know that Sony&#39;s press conference is the traditional capper to the press day that precedes the show floor&#39;s official opening the following day. And while that appears to be the same for 2026, there&#39;s a twist: Instead of an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will apparently have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Apparently the full event will be focused on two vehicles from Sony Honda Mobility — the Afeela 1 car that has made repeat appearances at CES, as well as an all-new concept model at the event.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference">How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference</h2>
<p>The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@shmafeela"><ins>Afeela official YouTube channel</ins></a>. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-sony-afeela-at-ces">What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES</h2>
<p>What&#39;s now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html"><ins>since CES 2020</ins></a>, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html"><ins>feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era</ins></a>,&quot; and that &quot;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&quot; Ouch.</p>
<p>But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/"><ins>said in a press release</ins></a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html?src=rss]]></description>

Not only does going wireless clear up your space and make charging as simple as setting your phone down, but it’s also surprisingly versatile. Whether you’re looking for a sleek charging pad for your nightstand, a stand that keeps your phone propped up on your desk or even a foldable charger for convenient travel, there&#39;s a wireless charger designed to fit your lifestyle. Some can even double as a car charger, keeping your phone powered up on the go without the hassle of cables to plug in. With so many convenient options, it&#39;s easy to see why more people are ditching their wired chargers and embracing the effortlessness of wireless. These are the best wireless chargers we&#39;ve tested so far.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-wireless-charger">What to look for in a wireless charger</h2> 
<p>While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">3-in-1 wireless charger</a> or full wireless charging station.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours.</p> 
<p>For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-charging-performance">Wireless charging performance</h2> 
<p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility.</p> 
<p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p> 
<p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DGJ4QQ5W&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1fe3d1e8-55e1-40d5-a463-1336dd916f19&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=latest+MagSafe+charging+pad&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1hZ1NhZmUtQ2hhcmdlci1DYXBhYmlsaXR5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjBER0o0UVE1Vy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWZlM2QxZTgtNTVlMS00MGQ1LWE0NjMtMTMzNmRkOTE2ZjE5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1hZ1NhZmUtQ2hhcmdlci1DYXBhYmlsaXR5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjBER0o0UVE1Vy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf2JDWR8j2ixl2Us5tU8PS-hr3dpnlftRDq8cDXA8Pwd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ4QQ5W%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible/dp/B0DGJ4QQ5W/">latest MagSafe charging pad</a> can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can.</p>

<p>Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link.</p> 
<p>Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs.</p> 
<p>You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-do-wireless-chargers-work-if-you-have-a-phone-case">Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case?</h3> 
<p>Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-know-if-my-phone-supports-wireless-charging">How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging?</h3> 
<p>Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.”</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-cords-charge-your-phone-faster">Do cords charge your phone faster?</h3> 
<p>Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple isn&#39;t ready to pay a several billion-dollar fine to UK App Store users and is filing an appeal over a major antitrust lawsuit. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/26/apple-seeks-to-appeal-15bn-ruling-it-overcharged-uk-customers"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Apple has requested to appeal to the UK&#39;s Court of Appeal, which would escalate the case beyond the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest appeal attempt follows an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-loses-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-over-app-store-fees-184515613.html">October decision</a> from the CAT, where the court found that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices by exploiting its dominant market position with the App Store to charge higher fees. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2025-12/14037721%20Dr.%20Rachael%20Kent%20v%20Apple%20Inc.%20and%20Apple%20Distribution%20International%20Ltd%20-%20%20Judgment%20%5B2025%5D%20CAT%2067%2023%20Oct%202025.pdf">CAT&#39;s ruling</a> established a £1.5 billion, or roughly $2 billion, fine, but Apple said it planned to appeal and that the court &quot;takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy.&quot; The CAT didn&#39;t grant Apple the appeal, leading the iPhone maker to seek a higher court to overturn the ruling.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple hasn&#39;t made any official statements about its latest appeal application, but it&#39;s likely that it will argue against the CAT&#39;s proposed App Store developer fee rate of between 15 and 20 percent, which it reached through &quot;informed guesswork,&quot; instead of the existing 30 percent. If the fine does ultimately stick, the $2 billion fine would be split amongst any App Store user in the UK who made purchases between 2015 and 2024, according to <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-escalates-its-appeal-of-a-2-billion-fine-from-a-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-201922558.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the high price tag of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneos-latest-handhelds-are-inspired-by-the-game-boy-and-gb-micro-163412607.html">Ayaneo Pocket DMG</a> turned some retro handheld fans away, Ayaneo is working on another remake of the classic Game Boy with a slightly more affordable cost. Ayaneo revealed the pricing for the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/908">Pocket Vert</a>, which starts at $269 for early bird orders.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/goods/9003564794101">Pocket DMG</a> that retails for $449, Ayaneo skipped the OLED and configurations that go up to 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage for the Pocket Vert. Instead, the handheld maker went with a fully metal CNC body and an ultra-minimalist design with engraving-free buttons that resemble the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011-150056369.html">Analogue Pocket</a>&#39;s look. Ayaneo built the Pocket Vert with a smaller 3.5-inch LCD screen that has a 1,600 x 1,440 resolution and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip that should allow the handheld to handle anything up to PS2 and some Nintendo Switch games.</p>

<p>To play more modern games, the Pocket Vert has a hidden touch pad below the buttons that acts as a makeshift joystick. Ayaneo also hid a fingerprint sensor in the power button and included a USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD slot for more storage capacity. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/ayaneo/ayaneo-pocket-vertcreate-a-top-of-the-line-gadget-for-vertical-retro-handheld-gamers">Indiegogo campaign</a> for the Pocket Vert isn&#39;t open yet, but it will be the only place to snag the latest vertical handheld from Ayaneo at its lowest price before it reverts to the retail price of $339. You can even opt for the fully specced-out version that&#39;s only available in Lava Red and has 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage for an early bird price of $369 and a later standard price of $439.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-game-boy-remake-will-have-an-early-bird-starting-price-of-269-174553644.html?src=rss]]></description>

Fans of the farm life simulator, specifically those who already own it for the Nintendo Switch 2, can download a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/">free upgrade</a> that introduces new features and multiplayer modes.</p>
<p>If you have <em>Stardew</em> <em>Valley</em> on the Switch 2, you can download the Upgrade Pack that introduces mouse controls to make it easier to place furniture and organize your inventory. The upgrade also adds local split-screen co-op for up to four players and online multiplayer that maxes out at eight players. On top of the co-op modes, the free content pack includes Game Share compatibility, meaning only one player needs a copy of <em>Stardew Valley</em> to share it with three others.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Upgrade Pack may not have as much content as a numbered update, but <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huiD0yR4_4I">some players</a> are already reporting bugs. According to user accounts, the online multiplayer mode isn&#39;t working, while other reports noted that some crafting recipes had inaccurate material requirements or quantities. In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737">post on X</a>, Eric Barone, the game&#39;s developer who&#39;s better known as ConcernedApe, said that he&#39;s taking &quot;full responsibility for this mistake&quot; and that the development team &quot;will fix this as soon as possible.&quot; <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004604445498429827?s=20">Later that day</a>, Barone posted that online co-op should be fixed on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions, adding that &quot;we are investigating and will follow up with patches as needed&quot; for the remaining issues.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is adding two brand new speakers to its audio lineup, along with updated soundbars boosted with AI features. While not as inconspicuous as the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-debuts-music-frame-speaker-to-pair-with-your-frame-tv-at-ces-2024-030024733.html">Samsung Frame</a>, the new WiFi speakers, called the Music Studio 5 and 7, were designed to blend into your living room&#39;s atmosphere with their minimalist design. However, if you&#39;re looking for a more convenient option, Samsung also updated its flagship HW-Q990H soundbar, while also introducing the more affordable choice of the HW-QS90H.</p>
<p>Samsung built the Music Studio 5 with a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, pairing them with a built-in waveguide to deliver better sound. To customize the sound, Samsung added its new AI Dynamic Bass Control that can make bass sound better without any distortion. You can even control the &quot;gallery-inspired&quot; speaker via voice or Bluetooth and it&#39;s compatible with WiFi casting and streaming services.</p>

<p>For an upgraded option, the Music Studio 7 comes with a 3.1.1-channel spatial audio that has top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers to give a more immersive 3D audio experience. You can calibrate the sound even further with the Samsung Audio Lab Pattern Control Technology and the same AI Dynamic Bass Control feature seen with the Music Studio 5. Samsung says the Music Studio 7 can play Hi-Resolution Audio with up to 24-bit/96kHz audio processing and can either be used as a standalone speaker or paired with other Samsung <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-announces-a-pair-of-flashy-new-party-speakers-153027692.html">audio devices</a>.</p>

<p>To round out its new audio offerings, Samsung debuted the HW-QS90H, or its All-in-One Soundbar, with a 7.1.2.-channel system that features 13 drivers, nine of which are wide-range speakers. The new soundbar&#39;s built-in Quad Bass Woofer system means you can achieve deeper bass without a separate subwoofer. The All-in-One Soundbar even features Samsung&#39;s Convertible Fit design that can handle being mounted on a wall or placed on a table, and a gyro sensor that can automatically adapt channel distribution depending on its orientation, like we saw with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs700f-soundbar-review-sophisticated-design-automatic-adjustments-180035549.html">QS700F</a>.</p>
<p>Samsung even refreshed its flagship HW-Q990H soundbar this year and introduced to it the Sound Elevation feature that makes dialogue sound more natural and Auto Volume, which regulates a consistent volume across its channels for a more balanced sound. All of Samsung&#39;s latest soundbars and speakers will be on display at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html">CES 2026</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>For those looking to relive some classic Nintendo or PlayStation titles, the Retroid Pocket 6 offers a great entry point into the retro handheld world since it can emulate games up to Nintendo Switch and PS2. However, Retroid did have some initial blowback about its design and decided to go back to the drawing board. Following the early criticisms, Retroid decided to add an option for customers to choose between having the D-pad or a thumbstick at the top of the handheld&#39;s left side.</p>

<p>The problems persisted for Retroid, as the handheld maker had to then cut short the early bird pricing thanks to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/there-arent-any-black-friday-deals-on-ram-this-year-and-you-can-thank-ai-for-that-130000335.html">widespread memory shortage</a>. Instead of offering the handheld for $209 until January, Retroid removed the discount in late December, leaving new buyers paying the full retail price of $229. However, the internal specs remained the same, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, up to 12GB of memory and up to 256GB of storage that&#39;s expandable with a TF card slot.</p>
<p>Despite the hiccups, Retroid looks ready to start shipments of its latest retro gaming handheld as evidenced by the new photos and videos. According to the website, the first batch of Retroid Pocket 6 preorders are due to start shipping in January. Second bath preoders are still available on Retroid&#39;s website, which are expected to get to customers in March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-first-real-look-at-the-retroid-pocket-6-running-ps2-games-193624145.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If streaming services’ <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here-and-now-its-a-competition-130052418.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">year-in-review</a> campaigns have shown us anything, it’s that we’ve spent a staggering amount of time drowning out the hum of everyday life with music, podcasts and audio series. And with some incredible new releases this year, we were really eatin’ good. Here are some of the Engadget team’s favorite things we listened to in 2025.</p><h2 id="aff7f80e-bda8-4cf9-8dfb-79488507995c">Spiritbox - <em>Tsunami Sea</em></h2><p>I became aware of Spiritbox in late 2024 shortly before the band dropped its latest album, <em>Tsunami Sea. </em>At the time, I was in a deep Sleep Token phase, and I don’t remember how I stumbled upon Spiritbox, but I’m sure glad I did. Not knowing anything about the band, I initially thought it had two singers: one for clean vocals and another for the harsh, guttural screams.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I was wrong. Vocalist Courtney LaPlante handles it all, and she is a force of nature. After learning of a new band, I do what any self-respecting music nerd does: I looked up live videos of them on YouTube. The way LaPlante seamlessly transitions from airy, ambient singing to some of the best growls you’ll hear in metal music is effortless. And after seeing Spiritbox live in person earlier in December, I can attest to her ability to consistently nail both vocal styles for the entirety of an hour-long set.&nbsp;</p><p>My infatuation with Spiritbox isn’t just with the vocalist though. Guitarist Mike Stringer, LaPlante’s husband, also has a lot of unique abilities to offer. Stringer’s use of noise and whammy effects in his riffs create a signature style, not to mention his mix of nu-metal, djent and metalcore sensibilities. He also has some of the thickest guitar tones I’ve ever heard live, and I was mesmerized for the full set. Stringer’s guitar work on <em>Tsunami Sea </em>is a prime example of a&nbsp; unique musician at the height of his powers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tsunami Sea </em>takes you on a ride. The first two tracks are all-out ragers, and after a slight respite in “Perfect Soul” and “Keep Sweet,” the album’s best song comes fifth. I’ve heard LaPlante dedicate it to “all the people I love to fucking hate,” and it’s clearly written about her enemies. It’s also the perfect example of what this band is capable of. It’s three minutes of LaPlante’s screams interlaced with plenty of Stringer’s trademark guitar work.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/80VTmBAnTSE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>The rest of the album showcases the band’s ability to blend dynamics, with “No Loss, No Love” and “Ride The Wave” providing the highlights on the back half of the record. The album’s title track is a great vehicle for LaPlante’s clean vocals, serving as the introduction to the album’s second act. If you’ve been enamored with Sleep Token this year like I have, give Spiritbox a go — you won’t be sorry you did. — <em>Billy Steele, Deputy Editor, Reviews</em></p><h2 id="914d02d0-400b-4c27-8572-6eb6ab5033d6"><em>Bandsplain</em></h2><p>I didn’t discover <em>Bandsplain </em>in 2025, but I definitely listened to it more than any other podcast in terms of total time spent. Sure, that’s because most episodes are over three hours long, but I digress. Host Yasi Salek does a deep dive on “cult bands and iconic artists” to… ahem, bandsplain why people love them. There’s a deep catalog of back episodes, so there’s sure to be an in-depth analysis of a band you’re familiar with. But even if you think you know an artist, I’m willing to bet Salek will divulge parts of the story you weren’t aware of.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy Eat World’s <em>Clarity </em>is a top 5 all-timer for me, and Salek had plenty to offer about the narrative around that album I didn’t know. Her grunge series from 2024 was a history lesson I wish I’d had in middle school when I first discovered Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the rest of the lot. An older episode about Nine Inch Nails served as the primer for me seeing the band live for the first time in September. And that’s the thing about the show: the back catalog holds up. If you’re waiting for the next installment to drop, there’s certainly something in the archives you’ll enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>No shade to Salek’s colleagues at <em>The Ringer, </em>but the best episodes of <em>Bandsplain </em>are when the guest is a musician. Thursday front man Geoff Rickly was excellent on that Nine Inch Nails episode, and Death Cab for Cutie singer Ben Gibbard had me on the edge of my seat when he was on to discuss The La’s — a band I’d never heard of before. I’d also highly recommend the episodes on Oasis and the more recent one on Alanis Morissette. But, really, you can’t go wrong starting from anywhere on the episode list. <em>— B.S.</em></p><h2 id="348e4012-5e93-4889-b389-38394040908a">Lucy Dacus - <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kRRvhAVZ84?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I remember being a teenager and hearing from an adult that they did not religiously seek out, research, evaluate and introduce new bands and songs into their lives as if all existence would cease without the life-sustaining energy of new music. I was confused, concerned and damn sure that wouldn’t happen to me.&nbsp;</p><p>You know where this story goes: Job. Kid. House. Spouse. Pets that will die if I don’t feed, walk, play with and/or medicate them. I allow the algorithm to feed me new songs but rarely does something stick, so I end up listening to tracks I bonded with in my teens and twenties.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=Blossom+%26+Bones&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmRjYWNiZjgtYzhmNC00OTQ0LWI1YzgtMzExN2FhMWVkZjMyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcONAodm2UFPcfTTiIwK541CZC8aehAz0FvMJy73RPFM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fghostranchmusicfestival%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.instagram.com/ghostranchmusicfestival/">Blossom &amp; Bones</a>, a three-day music festival in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, managed to push through the churn and lodge new music into my brain. Along with my kid and some friends, I camped among some of the most beautiful landscapes imaginable and ambled over to the stage each evening for performances by Santigold, Ani DiFranco and about a dozen more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy Dacus, one third of the indie group Boygenius, did a one-hour set with plenty of songs from her latest album <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>. Hearing the songs for the first time, I felt like I’d been listening to them for years. Lilting harmonies and layered strings create a lovely backdrop for Dacus’s velvet voice, but there’s a sharpness to her observations about relationships, rejection and sex. I’ve been looping the album ever since. — <em>Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying Advice</em></p><h2 id="357a8d1c-06b2-49ae-899f-9822adf82782">Blanco White - “So Certain” (single)</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8skj1w1XdFc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Early on the last concert of the day at that same festival, Blanco White took the stage. People were aimlessly milling about and the sun hadn’t yet set. Kids were playing on the lawn and the smell from the food trucks was intense, but I was enrapt by the four people on stage. The sad violin and strummy guitars floated with the hand-beat drum out into the red hills. The music sounded like I felt: rooted and wrapped in the harsh beauty of the desert and I was really glad to take that home with me. <em>— A.S.</em></p><h2 id="75068a5c-9263-40b8-bf74-fdd93ea57a88"><em>Martian Revolution&nbsp;</em></h2><p>If you&#39;re as big a nerd as I am, you might know that Leo Tolstoy didn&#39;t consider <em>War and Peace </em>to be a novel. The story is what most people read for, but in the author&#39;s mind, all the drama was a parable to illustrate his grand theory of history.</p><p>Over the last year, history podcaster Mike Duncan has accomplished a similar feat using a medium Tolstoy never imagined. Duncan&#39;s <em>Revolutions </em>podcast has covered ten different revolutionary upheavals across history, starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution. After wrapping up the Bolsheviks, Duncan took a few episodes to suggest a grand theory of how revolutions unfold. For a while, it seemed like that was all we&#39;d get. Then, in the middle of 2024, he started posting original sci-fi — without any indication that this tale, which followed future Martians revolting against their corporate overlords on Earth, was in any way different from the previous ten seasons.</p><p>Part of what makes the Martian Revolution so excellent is Duncan&#39;s deadpan delivery. He never once breaks character. He rattles off lists of fictional sources, apologizes for inaccuracies in prior episodes, and introduces made-up historical figures with the same gravity he once used to mention George Washington or Simon Bolivar. If you&#39;re a fan of <em>Revolutions, </em>you&#39;ll have a blast recognizing character archetypes. (Mabel Dore is the Liberal Noble! Timothy Werner is the Man of Blood!)</p><p>But the podcast is great even if you&#39;ve never listened to an episode of <em>Revolutions. </em>It has an excellent grasp of character and a sense of inevitable tragedy, but with moments of joy leavened throughout. I certainly hope we don&#39;t wind up in the megacorp-ruled future of the podcast, but if we do, it&#39;ll be a great consolation if it eventually turns out the way Duncan imagines.<em> — Sam Chapman, Senior Writer</em></p><h2 id="d1b2cc8f-a744-49b9-97f1-0e132570b47a">Ron Gallo - <em>Checkmate</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUc44nDVkNk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>My favorite artists are ones that surprise me, and Ron Gallo is a master of reinvention. He&#39;s dabbled in absurdist punk, psychedelia, garage rock, Beatles-tinged pop and, now, stripped-down acoustic music. This is not a genre I am typically a fan of, Elliott Smith withstanding, but <em>Checkmate</em> is something special. His lyrical prowess is off the charts here, trading his usual wordplay for simple and emotionally-gutting truisms about life, love and, well, the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the lyrics wouldn&#39;t work if the songs weren&#39;t good. The songs are very good. The title track is just about the perfect love song, with a primary hook that gets lost in your head for weeks. Other tracks offer hints of Mac DeMarco, Dan Fogelberg, Kevin Morby and just about everyone else who has crafted great songs on an acoustic guitar. It&#39;s fitting that Gallo has found a home on the label Kill Rock Stars, which released so much of Elliott Smith&#39;s work back in the day. As an aside, Gallo regularly posts songs about current events on TikTok and other social media platforms, which are worth checking out if you like stuff like Jesse Welles. <em>— Lawrence Bonk, Contributing Reporter</em></p><h2 id="045e5129-981d-4dec-bee9-43aa358ff3b1">De La Soul -<em> Cabin in the Sky</em></h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQWm1hfju3Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>There have been hip-hop albums that explored the finality and tragedy of death, but not many that truly tackled spirituality and long-term grief. De La Soul has done just that, following the passing of founding member Trugoy the Dove. This album serves as a final testament of sorts for Trugoy, as he&#39;s heavily featured throughout. In that way, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest&#39;s 2016 masterpiece <em>We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service</em>, which followed the death of rapper Phife Dawg.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Tribe&#39;s modern classic, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is filled with absolute bangers. It features standout beats by DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Trugoy, Jake One and others. The rhymes are great and all three primary De La members are given time to shine. Guest rappers like Common and Nas got the memo, delivering some of their most memorable verses in years. Heck, even Giancarlo Esposito is on board as the narrator. Some reviewers have dinged this album for being too long but, come on, that&#39;s like complaining there&#39;s too much pizza. It&#39;s De La Soul. <em>— L.B.</em></p><h2 id="a717515e-90c3-4e2f-9d84-9de305a72856">FKA twigs - <em>Eusexua</em></h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnGSVIZGkQo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>This was a really good year for new music IMO, so much that I&#39;ve been finding it pretty difficult to think back and settle on my favorite releases. But, FKA twigs&#39; <em>Eusexua</em> undeniably did some heavy lifting for me, pretty much carrying me through the first six or so months of the year without much competition, and I&#39;ve circled right back to it as the year closes. It&#39;s an album that somehow seems to meet every vibe. It&#39;ll have you in club mode and ready for a night of sweaty, filthy dancing in under three minutes, or feeling bright and upbeat like a midday walk on the first day of spring — yet it still hits when you&#39;re having a good ol&#39; car cry.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Girl Feels Good&quot; is for sure one of my most-played songs of the year, followed closely by &quot;Eusexua,&quot; &quot;Perfect Stranger,&quot; &quot;Keep It, Hold It&quot; and &quot;Striptease.&quot; If ever I can&#39;t decide what I&#39;m in the mood to listen to, I throw this album on and it doesn&#39;t disappoint.<em> — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor</em></p><h2 id="121a7e44-5a35-427e-8ab3-8861f5b4f8e9">Faetooth - <em>Labyrinthine</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6prtDY9fQQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Faetooth&#39;s sophomore album, <em>Labyrinthine</em>, is face-melting, melancholic perfection. The band describes its sound as &quot;fairy doom,&quot; but don&#39;t let that first word fool you into thinking it isn&#39;t heavy as hell. <em>Labyrinthine</em> goes unbelievably hard, and will have you feeling like you&#39;re eternally wandering a cursed bog, surrounded by the wailing of the unfortunate souls who came before you. Don&#39;t believe me? Put on &quot;White Noise.&quot; This is really an album that should be enjoyed in its entirety, though, and I can&#39;t individually name half the songs on it because I tend to just keep the whole thing playing on rotation. <em>— C.M.&nbsp;</em></p><h2 id="50e847e0-53c8-4c3e-8d0b-af387419732d">Orville Peck - <em>Appaloosa</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q0wlv9CRKw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>This EP is truly a testament to my ability to run my obsessions into the ground, because it only came out in mid-November and somehow landed on my most-listened wrapup for the end of the year… which was released some two weeks later. It&#39;s front-loaded with its strongest songs, a powerful and kind of haunting trio that just flows beautifully from one into the other: &quot;Dreaded Sundown,&quot; to &quot;Drift Away&quot; into &quot;Atchafalaya&quot; (ft. Noah Cyrus). As a fan of musicals, I also loved the inclusion of &quot;Maybe This Time,&quot; a cover from <em>Cabaret</em>, especially since I was pretty bummed to have missed Peck&#39;s stint as the Emcee in <em>Cabaret</em> on Broadway this summer. <em>— C.M.</em></p><h2 id="f81e58b3-82cd-4f8f-8669-362bf94f0357"><em>Case 63&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I got into an audio series kick this year, and dove into shows like <em>Unicorn Girl</em>, <em>Stalked!</em> and more. But none of the dramatized fiction I listened to in 2025 had me hooked like <em>Case 63</em>. Setting aside that it’s voice-acted by A-listers Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, which is a phenomenal pairing that won me over on star power alone. The best thing about <em>Case 63</em> is its storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p>Moore stars as a psychologist, meeting Isaac for the first time in a prison interview. Isaac has been claiming to be a traveler of sorts, and through recorded sessions and voice notes, we hear his side of the story, as well as her reactions and ultimate involvement in the adventures. Every step of the way, particularly in the beginning, there is clear explanation as to why the exchange is being recorded. It isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful in my buying into the realism of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn’t just the method and technical aspects of the storytelling, of course. Narratively, <em>Case 63</em> is a gripping ride, and thanks to its short episodes, it’s easy to binge really quickly. There is certainly a generous use of cliffhangers to help speed things along, but I found myself eager to devour the entire series in one commute. The story continued to linger in my mind days after I finished both existing seasons, and I’m hoping the new one drops soon. If you’re looking for a quick and easy sci-fi audio series, do not miss <em>Case 63</em>. —<em> Cherlynn Low, Managing Editor</em></p><h2 id="64a4d5af-a325-4bf8-92e0-ec7d8cfac840"><em>Secure Love&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I spent a lot of time this year trying to learn more about my attachment style and how it shows up in all the relationships in my life. Between Stephanie Rigg’s <em>On Attachment</em> podcast, the TV show <em>Couples Therapy</em> and all the books on the topic of attachment styles, trauma and more, I’ve consumed them all. And while they’ve all been helpful in different ways, one podcast stuck out to me this year.

Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted.&nbsp;</p><p>This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style.&nbsp;</p><p>As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends.&nbsp;</p><p>It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend <em>The Secure Love Podcast</em> highly enough. <em>— C.L.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss]]></description>

Whether it&#39;s a slim folio case, an Apple Pencil, a docking station or a paper-like screen protector, there are so many iPad accessories out there that can transform how you use your tablet on a regular basis — and make your iPad last longer, too. We&#39;ve tested a plethora of accessories over the years, and these are the best iPad accessories you can get right now.</p>

<p>Before you splurge on a bunch of accessories, you should double check which <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">iPad generation</a> you own. There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the now discontinued 9th-gen iPad that still requires a Lightning cable. Make sure to double check your iPad’s screen size before buying a folio for iPad or a screen protector — especially if you have the new iPad Air 11-inch. As for the Apple Pencil, check out this guide to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-pencil-lineup-is-a-mess-so-heres-a-guide-to-which-one-you-should-buy-190040913.html">how to choose the right Apple Pencil</a> (and even replacement pencil tips) to make sure you&#39;re getting the right one for the tablet you have.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-ipad-screen-protectors">iPad screen protectors</h3> 
<p>If you’re a heavy user of the Apple Pencil or some other stylus, you should consider getting a screen protector for your new iPad. They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Google support page in Hindi says the ability to change your Gmail address is on the way. The feature would allow you to replace your current @<a target="_blank" class="link">gmail.com</a> address with another. Your old address would remain active as an alias on the account, and all your data would stick around, unaffected.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">support page</a> (translated) says that &quot;the ability to change your Google Account email address is gradually rolling out to all users.&quot; The change was first spotted on a Google Pixel <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4453" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">forum</a> on Telegram and was first reported in the press by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/24/google-change-gmail-addresses/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>9to5Google</em></a>.</p><p>Google hasn&#39;t made a formal announcement about the change. The English version of the support page still says you usually can&#39;t change your @<a target="_blank" class="link">gmail.com</a> address. Up to this point, Google has only allowed address changes for <a target="_blank" class="link">non-gmail.com</a> addresses.</p><p>Engadget reached out to Google for confirmation. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back.</p><p>When the feature (presumably) rolls out broadly, you&#39;ll change it through your account settings. Sign in to your Google account, then go to <strong>Manage your Google account &gt; Personal info &gt; Google Account email</strong>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG has revealed a new lineup of gaming monitors <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html">just ahead of CES</a>. The UltraGear evo displays offer 5K visuals. Many incorporate on-device AI upscaling, taking some of the burden away from the GPU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LG says the tech will let consumers skip out on some card upgrades. This could end up being extremely beneficial because the AI boom has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html"><ins>been impacting GPU prices</ins></a>.</p>

<p>There are three displays in the lineup so far, with more to come down the line. There&#39;s a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will &quot;refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience.&quot;</p>
<p>This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time. It&#39;s curved with a 21:9 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a 27-inch MiniLED (27GM950B) in the lineup. This display has been &quot;designed to dramatically improve blooming control&quot;, which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it &quot;preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike.&quot;</p>
<p>This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#39;s the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display. You didn&#39;t read that wrong. This is a 52-inch gaming monitor. This 5K display offers a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.</p>
<p>LG hasn&#39;t released any information as to when we&#39;ll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost. With all the tech on offer, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll cost a pretty penny.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html?src=rss]]></description>

A father and three children are living on a remote island near Antarctica, taking care of a vast seed bank that was part of an abandoned research facility. They’re literally trying to stay above water for a few months until they get bailed out from the island along with as much of the seed bank as they can save before it goes under when a woman named Rowan washes up on shore. She survives, is nursed back to health, and starts forming bonds with her rescuers and their mission — but at the same time, she has some unexpected connections to the island and the former research team that lived there that she keeps to herself.</p><p>The magic of this book is in the way Charlotte McConaghy builds tensions from many sources throughout the book; you feel a lingering sense of discomfort through, waiting for the other shoe to fall even as Rowan gets closer and closer to the family. It’s a small-scale story at its heart, but with the backdrop of disaster looming the stakes feel extremely high. And McConaghy is a master at putting these feelings on the page in gorgeous prose. As she showed in her previous work <em>Migrations</em>, she has a real talent for realistically describing near-future climate disasters, but <em>Wild Dark Shore</em> raises the personal stakes in a visceral way. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2 id="fd29ffcf-a133-4079-955f-7e3609b2eadf"><em>Moonflow</em> by Bitter Karella&nbsp;</h2><p>This book is a chaotic and deeply weird rollercoaster ride that repeatedly gave me whiplash, and I loved it.

After Sarah ventures into these woods in search of the King's Breakfast, a rare mushroom said to grant divine understanding to those who consume it, all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Karella's writing is immersive, and this is the kind of book you can see, feel, hear and smell, for better and worse. Every person in this book is like a caricature of someone I've crossed paths with at some point in life, and the names of the cult members are just… <em>chef's kiss</em>. Some of them had me howling. It is completely unpredictable — except in those few moments where it seems the author wants you to know <em>exactly</em> where things are going just to make you dread the inevitable. Reading <em>Moonflow</em> was a visceral, unforgettable experience. —<em> Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor</em></p><h2 id="42a318fe-ad30-42b2-95aa-30382e3f4850"><em>Simplicity</em> by Mattie Lubchansky</h2><p>Another one about a cult, except this cult rules.

And here in the Hudson Valley, it often feels like I'm one or two innocuous decisions away from accidentally joining a cult, so there was an immediate connection. In <em>Simplicity</em>, it's the year 2081 and New York City is a high-tech dystopia run by a billionaire. North of the city, though, various communities have settled off-grid, including a group called The Spiritual Association of Peers.</p><p>Lucius Pasternak, a trans man, is sent on an anthropological assignment from the mayor to SAP's compound, Simplicity, and it doesn't take long for their uninhibited way of life to start growing on him. But Lucius soon begins to have strange dreams, and a series of violent attacks shakes up the community. Through his mission to understand the people of SAP and later to find and stop the entity that's targeting them, a beautiful story about queerness and identity and belonging and fighting for what's important unfolds. This feels like the kind of book that should be passed around between friends who just <em>get it</em>, and I imagine many readers will feel incredibly seen by it like I did. <em>— C.M.&nbsp;</em></p><h2 id="0a50dfc8-04da-47e2-9490-fe8ecec11f66"><em>The Buffalo Hunter Hunter</em> by Stephen Graham Jones</h2><p>Or Stephen Graham Jones' <em>Interview with the Vampire. </em><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_1668075083&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=af2913af-d234-4938-a346-77b820d4db0c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=The+Buffalo+Hunter+Hunter&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0J1ZmZhbG8tSHVudGVyLVN0ZXBoZW4tR3JhaGFtLUpvbmVzL2RwLzE2NjgwNzUwODM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWYyOTEzYWYtZDIzNC00OTM4LWEzNDYtNzdiODIwZDRkYjBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0J1ZmZhbG8tSHVudGVyLVN0ZXBoZW4tR3JhaGFtLUpvbmVzL2RwLzE2NjgwNzUwODMiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV3QkanHgM8pYq19cGSxfS4jhbWU2wtv0dZ64hvNhvYk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBuffalo-Hunter-Stephen-Graham-Jones%2Fdp%2F1668075083" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Hunter-Stephen-Graham-Jones/dp/1668075083"><em>The Buffalo Hunter Hunter</em></a> blends historical fiction and horror to give us one of the most impactful vampire novels of our time — one that serves as an uncomfortable but necessary reminder of the atrocities committed against indigenous people in the US by white settlers. It begins with the discovery of a crumbling journal that claims to contain the confession of a Blackfeet man-turned-vampire named Good Stab, as told to Lutheran pastor Arthur Beaucarne. What follows is a gutting chronicle of slaughter, heartbreak and revenge. It's a classic in the making. — <em>C.M.</em></p><h2 id="75131abb-5d6a-447c-afb7-af3e4b8d0436"><em>Isola</em> by Allegra Goodman</h2><p>Historical fiction is how I trick my brain into possibly learning something. And because the endings are set, the author has to hook you into the drama with more than just the peril of an unknown outcome. I fell deep into <em>Wolf Hall</em> even though I knew which heads Henry VIII chopped off. I thought <em>Isola </em>might be similarly gratifying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It tells the story of Marguerite de la Rocque de Roberval, a young noblewoman from France who was intentionally marooned on an island off the coast of Canada in 1542. The story is based on historical records so you know the plot won’t adhere to safe <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Cat!:_The_Last_Book_on_Screenwriting_You%27ll_Ever_Need" data-i13n="slk:formulas;cpos:5;pos:1">formulas</a>, but <em>mon dieu</em>, I was not prepared for how rough things would be for Marguerite.&nbsp;</p><p>Her troubles began long before she found herself fighting for survival on a wild uninhabited island with brutal winters. From birth, nearly every happiness was undercut by more dominant forces, yet the woman never stopped moving forward. Thankfully, Goodman draws Marguerite’s character not as some tired brand of plucky heroine with grit and a wink, but as a perceptive, pragmatic being who also gives in to impulse and doesn’t have everything figured out.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D3C1P3FS&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=af2913af-d234-4938-a346-77b820d4db0c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Isola&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAXUdOfuI95PfofNh_m0lHwfRdZl8eJGH7vgLT2eLkrka&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIsola-Novel-Allegra-Goodman-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0D3C1P3FS" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;slk:Isola;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Isola-Novel-Allegra-Goodman-ebook/dp/B0D3C1P3FS"><em>Isola</em></a><em> </em>is beautifully rendered, from the stone chateaus to creaking ships and rough abundance of the island.

What follows is the aftermath of that decision. <em>Meet Me at the Crossroads</em> is a haunting and emotional journey.&nbsp; — <em>C.M.</em></p><h2 id="2b88adde-6305-4e70-9457-267571bb350e"><em>Woodworking by </em>Emily St. James</h2><p>I am a cisgender, white middle-aged man, so the experience of learning and accepting a different gender identity is something I will never fully understand. But <em>Woodworking,</em> the debut novel by Emily St. James, is a hilarious, tragic and ultimately hopeful look at two trans women navigating different moments of acceptance in their lives. Erica is a mid-30s high school teacher who is recently divorced and just figuring out that she’s trans, something no one else knows about her at the start. Her student, 17-year-old Abigail, is her opposite: proudly out about her identity in a way that’s uncommon and dangerous in her small, conversative town in South Dakota. </p><p>Their paths intersect, and Abigail ends up in the uncomfortable and somewhat unethical role of helping Erica find herself. After all she’s confident and not afraid of who she is — but she’s also still a teenager, one dealing with massive trauma of her own. The dual look into these two protagonists, each with sections of the book narrated from their own points of view, gave me a vivid picture of the different challenges, emotions and dangers trans people face. But the unexpected community that develops around both characters plainly shows the value of living as your true self in a way that (hopefully) anyone should be able to relate to. <em>— N.I.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/our-favorite-books-we-read-in-2025-160000704.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG will present a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/12/lg-to-unveil-home-robot-at-ces-2026-sharing-vision-for-the-zero-labor-home/"><ins>home robot</ins></a> named CLOiD at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html"><ins>CES 2026</ins></a> in Las Vegas. With humanoid robotics sure to feature heavily at this year&#39;s tech conference, LG has teased its home assistant before a full unveiling in January.</p>
<p>The company says CLOiD&#39;s two articulated arms with five individually actuated fingers are designed to help with a variety of household tasks. However, LG has not yet given a specific example of a task CLOiD can handle. We&#39;re also not sure what it looks like, because aside from a couple of very close-up images of CLOiD&#39;s hands, LG is keeping what the robot looks like under wraps until the show.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG said CLOiD is part of the company&#39;s vision that “Zero Labor Home, Makes Quality Time.” It said its robot is a step toward a company goal of &quot;freeing customers from the time-consuming demands of housework.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLOiD&#39;s chipset is housed in its head, which also sports a display, speaker, camera and a bevy of sensors meant to enable expressive communication. LG says its new robot is powered by its &quot;Affectionate Intelligence&quot; technology and is designed to interact in a neutral, user-friendly way. It&#39;s also designed to refine its responses through repeated interactions with a user.</p>
<p>CES often plays host to proof-of-concept products that offer a window into the future but may <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html"><ins>not make it to market</ins></a>. It remains to be seen if CLOiD is simply a booth-side attention-getter or something with real potential. Visitors can see CLOiD handle some real-life scenarios at LG&#39;s booth in the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian regulators have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gov.br/cade/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/cade-forma-maioria-pela-homologacao-de-tcc-em-investigacao-sobre-praticas-da-apple-no-ios"><ins>reached a settlement</ins></a> with Apple after a yearslong investigation into the company&#39;s App Store fee practices as well as its policies against third-party app stores. As first reported by Brazilian tech site <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://tecnoblog.net/noticias/apple-ainda-podera-cobrar-taxas-no-brasil-veja-aliquotas/"><em><ins>tecnoblog</ins></em></a>, the nation&#39;s Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) said it has accepted Apple&#39;s proposed agreement that will address claims of anticompetitive practices.</p>
<p>The agreement will allow for third-party payment processing methods for in-app purchases and reins in Apple&#39;s anti-steering efforts by allowing links to external websites for transactions. The settlement requires that these payment options be shown next to Apple&#39;s own. Apple must also allow third-party app stores to be installed on its devices, though the company is allowed to display warnings to users if they are written in a neutral and objective way.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A new fee structure has also been agreed to, with Apple applying no fee if users are directed to outside payment methods in a text-only way. The use of a clickable link or button for an external payment option will incur a 15 percent fee. Purchases made within Apple&#39;s App Store will still be subject to a 10 percent or 20 percent commission. Developers using Apple’s payment system would also be subject to a 5 percent transaction fee.</p>
<p>Additionally a 5 percent &quot;Core Technology Fee&quot; would be levied against all app downloads from third-party app stores. This new structure bears similarities to policy and fee <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html"><ins>changes made</ins></a> after the EU passed its Digital Markets Act, with Apple allowing third-party app stores and external purchases subject to varying fees.</p>
<p>Apple will have 105 days to comply under the new agreement and could face fines of up to $27 million for failure to implement the changes. The iPhone maker has been facing mounting pressure from regulators worldwide over its anti-steering practices and was recently handed a $587 million fine by the EU for violating its Digital Markets Act. Apple is <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-appeals-the-eus-anti-steering-fine-120015154.html"><ins>appealing</ins></a> the fine.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Losing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">AirPods</a> happens to the best of us. They’re small, they slide into couch cushions and they love disappearing into bags or pockets when you least expect it. Luckily, Apple’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109020" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Find My</a> system makes it easy to track down misplaced AirPods, whether you dropped the case somewhere or can’t find one of the individual earbuds. With the right settings enabled, your iPhone can show the last place they were connected, play a sound to help you hunt them down or even guide you with on-screen directions. Here’s how to use Find My to locate lost AirPods and how to track down the left or right earbud if only one has gone missing.</p><h2 id="14ade866-3a37-48e6-aab5-2ed15678eeef">How to use Find My to locate AirPods</h2><p>If your AirPods are paired with an Apple device linked to your Apple ID, they automatically appear in the Find My app. You don’t need to enable this manually, but you do need Bluetooth turned on during regular use so the system can refresh their location.</p><p>Open the <strong>Find My app</strong> on your iPhone, iPad or Mac and go to the <strong>Devices</strong> tab. Your AirPods should appear in the list. If they’re online or recently connected to your device, Find My will show their current location on a map. If they’re offline, the app will show the last place they were detected, which can help narrow down where to start searching.</p><p>For many people, this alone is enough to jog a memory. Find My might show your gym, a friend’s house or the bus stop where they slipped out of your pocket. If the location seems familiar, head there first and refresh the app once you arrive so it can update if the AirPods reconnect.</p><p>If Find My says your AirPods are nearby but you still can’t see them, you can make them play a locating sound. Tap <strong>Play Sound</strong> in the device menu and the earbuds will emit a rising chirp that gets louder over a few seconds. This is especially helpful for finding AirPods hiding under blankets, inside bags or behind furniture.</p><p>Keep in mind that AirPods need enough battery to make noise, and the charging case itself cannot play sound unless you have AirPods 4 (ANC), AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3 that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/airpods/dev8e8b93d71/web" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">support that feature</a>. If nothing plays, try refreshing the app or checking the last location again.</p><p>AirPods models, like the AirPods Pro (2nd gen) and AirPods Pro (3rd gen) with MagSafe charging cases support Precision Finding. This feature uses the U1 chip inside your iPhone to show a directional arrow, distance estimate and haptic feedback as you get closer. Not all models have this feature, but if yours do, the Find My app will display a Find Nearby button.</p><p>Follow the on-screen prompts and slowly rotate your phone. The iPhone will show when you’re walking in the right direction and tell you when you’re close enough to start looking under cushions or inside drawers.</p><h2 id="8f4979f1-34bc-4c0f-b25e-b2b7b6b08001">How to locate individual AirPods</h2><p>AirPods have a habit of separating from each other, and losing only the left or right earbud may happen as frequently as misplacing the entire case. One of the most useful features in Find My is the ability to track each earbud individually. Here’s how to do it:</p><ul><li><p>Locate your AirPods in the Find My app and select the option to locate the <strong>Left </strong>or <strong>Right </strong>earbud.</p></li><li><p>Select the earbud that’s missing. The map will update to show its location.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If the missing bud has nearby location support, you can use <strong>Find Nearby</strong> to get directional guidance. If not, you can still use <strong>Play Sound</strong>, as long as it has enough battery.</p></li></ul><p>If Find My shows your lost earbud as <strong>Offline</strong>, you’ll still see its last known location. This can be enough to help you retrace your steps. Once you get within Bluetooth range again, the status may change to <strong>Online </strong>and let you use <strong>Play Sound</strong>.</p><p>If you think the earbud is still somewhere in your home, try refreshing Find My while walking slowly from room to room. The device may reconnect once you get close enough.</p><h2 id="518f8d4c-f10a-478c-9c54-89dbf0ff9917">How to find a missing AirPods case</h2><p>Finding the AirPods case is a little trickier because only newer models have support for sound playback or Precision Finding. If your case supports Find My, you’ll see options similar to locating the earbuds themselves. If it doesn’t, the app will only show the last place the case was connected.</p><p>If your earbuds are in the case but the case is not supported by Find My, you may not be able to play sound until you open it or pull one of the earbuds out.</p><p>Find My is a powerful tool for tracking down misplaced AirPods, and knowing how to use all of its features makes the search much easier. Whether you’re trying to find the entire set, one stray earbud or a case that wandered off, the app can lead you back to them with sound alerts, location markers and even directional guidance on supported models. With a few minutes of searching, you’ll usually have your AirPods back in your ears and your music playing again.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-ps5-ssd-faqs">PS5 SSD FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-ps5-storage-do-i-need">How much PS5 storage do I need?</h3> 
<p>The PlayStation 5 and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-5-pro-review-a-superpowered-700-console-for-gamers-who-wont-buy-a-pc-110056410.html">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> can accept internal drives with between 250GB and 8TB of storage capacity. If you already own a PS5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5 or PS5 Pro, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience.</p> 
<p>PS5 games are smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-kicks-it-back-to-the-90s-on-october-25-182038777.html"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Warzone 2.0</em> can eat up to 240GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up more than one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on a regular PS5 internally before running into problems.</p> 
<p>You also need to consider your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.</p>

<p>Off the bat, there&#39;s basically no point in going for a 250GB PS5 SSD. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones — and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives can be a decent option, but after years of declining prices, I think the sweet spot for most people is to opt for a high-capacity 1TB or 2TB drive, which should run you at most $200. The latter will more than double the PS5 Pro’s storage without breaking the bank.</p> 
<p>Unless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB and 8TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p> 
<p>While the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB PS5 SSD, you&#39;ll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games. Out of the box, the PS5 Pro offers 1.86TB of storage for games, though you can eke out more if you delete the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom (gasp).</p> 
<p>Since neither the PS5 Slim nor PS5 Pro feature updated CPU architecture, all of our recommendations will work with whatever PS5 model you own.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-play-ps5-games-on-an-external-ssd">Can you play PS5 games on an external SSD?</h3> 
<p>External hard drives tend to cost less than internal SSD counterparts (and there’s a good chance you might own one already). Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PlayStation 4 games, or storing PS5 titles. That’s useful if you have anything but the best high-speed internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or want to keep your PS4 library on hand.</p> 
<p>Due to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X9 Pro and Samsung T7 being options we’ve tried and can recommend.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ssd-cards-are-compatible-with-the-ps5">Which SSD cards are compatible with the PS5?</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/">official answer</a> to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are additional factors to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.</p> 
<p>For speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-interview-ps5-151025038.html"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a> — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn&#39;t match the Gen4 x4 spec.</p> 
<p>In our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet doesn’t mean there won’t be games that could be problematic in the future. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec isn’t huge, and you might as well cover all your bases.</p> 
<p>Slightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most new SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 40mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive.</p> 
<p>This previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LP, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that meet those requirements. That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often cheaper and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.</p> 
<p>The only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat.</p> 
<p>So, head to your PC component seller of choice and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.”</p> 
<p>One recommendation is this <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07QNRP9HK&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e75133dc-8c16-459b-9bf8-6f3892cd7c77&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=%246+copper+heatsink&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAY9FyGa7x_7G84BPrDei8of9iQY078tZcoIJFnYRi5zW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHeatsink-Copper-Copper%2525EF%2525BC%25258C-Silicone-Thermal%2Fdp%2FB07QNRP9HK" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Heatsink-Copper-Copper%EF%BC%8C-Silicone-Thermal/dp/B07QNRP9HK">$6 copper heatsink</a>, which attaches to the PS5 SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and in performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall (including the thermal interface material) and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches.</p> 
<p>One last thing: When shopping for a PS5 NVMe, there’s no reason to buy a Gen5 model over a more affordable Gen4 model. As things stand, Sony’s console can’t take advantage of the new standard, and though Gen5 drives are backward compatible, they’re more expensive than their Gen4 counterparts. Just buy the fastest and highest-capacity Gen4 model you can afford.</p>

Naturally, it's a spec monster, with a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. But it also offers an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring that activates the camera automatically when you rotate it.</p>
<p>Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness. On top of the impressive main and telephoto lenses, they offer a 50MP ultrawide and a 50MP selfie camera. And battery life shouldn't be an issue, thanks to the 6,800mAh silicon-carbon battery that supports 90 watt wired and 50 watt wireless charging.</p>

<p>The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well, Leica touches. Those include a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on front, textured edges and film simulations like Leica's Monopan 50 black and white. As for the zoom ring, Xiaomi says "its rotation [eliminates] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm." It can be reprogrammed for functions like exposure compensation and manual focus as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other features unique to that model include a "Leica Moments" 3:2 aspect ratio, special encryption chip, and dual-satellite connection. And as befits a special edition, it comes in a custom box with a lens cap, lanyard, magnetic case and branded cleaning cloth.</p>
<p>The one caveat is the price.

microSD Express Card</a>. The first five are made by genuine storage manufacturers, while the GameStop and Onn cards appear to be rebadged versions of other models. We used the 256GB version of every card except for Lexar Play Pro, which was 1TB.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>After timing these microSD Express cards across a range of Switch 2 games, our advice is simple: Get whichever one is in stock for the lowest price in the capacity you want. They aren’t identically<em>&nbsp;</em>fast, especially if you want to move a game to the card from the console’s internal storage (or vice versa). But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy.</p> 
<p>All five cards loaded up the digital version of <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-mario-kart-world-is-the-opposite-of-punishing-110039837.html"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, for instance, between 18 and 20 seconds. Each loaded the first Grand Prix race in about 6.5 seconds. Getting to the start screen of <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-switch-2/"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>took about 38 or 39 seconds in each case. Loading a save in a particularly asset-heavy area (<a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Jig-Jig_Street">Jig-Jig Street</a>) then took between 26 and 29 seconds, depending on the card. (The one exception was with the Onn card, which averaged closer to 31 seconds with that particular task, though that’s also the cheapest choice.)</p> 
<p>With <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fast-fusion-switch-2/"><em>Fast Fusion</em></a>, a smaller native Switch 2 game, the initial load always took six to seven seconds, while each card loaded the first championship race in roughly 4 seconds. It was a similar situation with the Switch 2 upgrade for <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> (using a Switch 1 cartridge): Each card took just over six seconds to get to the start screen, between 19 and 20 seconds to load a save just before the final boss, about 16 seconds to fast travel between <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Kakariko_Village_(Breath_of_the_Wild)">Kakariko Village</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Korok_Forest">Korok Forest</a>, and so on. We saw no significant issues with in-game loads when playing each game, either.</p>

<p>All of this suggests that the Switch 2 has a relatively specific target for these cards to hit, and that there may not be much room for one model to leap too far out in front of the others. We’ll also note that the console’s built-in storage was consistently faster than any external option: The gap wasn’t always big, but no card truly outpaced it in any of our tests. Loading that demanding area in <em>Cyberpunk</em>, for example, took about 22.5 seconds on average. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all.</p>

It had no outliers across our many game loading tests, and it was consistently right near the top when it came to moving games to and from system storage, which means it offers strong sequential read and write performance. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-microsd-card-130038282.html">microSD card buying guide</a>.</p>

<p>Putting <em>Mario Kart</em> (a 21.9GB file) on that card took four minutes and 39 seconds on average, which was only second to the Lexar Play Pro by six seconds. It was the fastest to write <em>Fast Fusion</em> (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. Only PNY’s card was faster to move games back to the console’s storage, but that one was far slower at writing games to the card — getting <em>Mario Kart </em>on there took seven minutes and 11 seconds on average. Just note that the 128GB version of SanDisk’s card has slower sequential writes than the larger versions, including much slower <em>sustained</em> write speeds (100 MB/s vs 210-220 MB/s). So transferring a game to that particular model will take much longer. The Onn card was also slower to move games back to system storage, taking about 50 seconds more than the SanDisk with <em>Mario Kart</em> and nearly three minutes longer with <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p> 
<p>Practically speaking, though, speed differences aren’t as important in this case as having lots of space to hold games at a price you can live with. To make things easy, we’ve listed every Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing below.

<p>As you can see, while the SanDisk card is fast, it’s also the most expensive of an already-pricey bunch. Is it worth an extra $10-20 to shave a couple seconds off certain loads in certain games, or a couple minutes when moving a game to external storage? Probably not for most people.</p> 
<p>But stock for all of these cards has been a bit patchy since the Switch 2 landed, particularly for the Walmart Onn model, which has typically been the cheapest choice. More recently, the GameStop-branded cards seem to have sold out too. If only one card is actually available by the time you read this — and you must have it today — it’s safe to just get it. You won’t lose or gain all that much when it comes to real-world performance.</p> 
<p>We’ve recommended holding off on buying a microSD Express card for as long as possible in previous updates to this guide, and ultimately each model above should still come down in price over time. We saw multiple <a data-i13n="cpos:42;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/switch-2-black-friday-deals-these-microsd-express-cards-are-up-to-25-percent-off-151331318.html">Express card discounts</a> during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, for instance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But between President Trump’s <a data-i13n="cpos:43;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/topic/tariffs/">tariff hikes</a> and the ongoing <a data-i13n="cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html">AI-driven shortages</a> for memory and high-capacity storage, you’d be justified if you wanted to grab the largest card you can reasonably afford sooner rather than later.

You should still try to use all 256GB baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you absolutely need more space right away, the cards above should be fine today.</p>

<p>Most microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with <a data-i13n="cpos:47;pos:1" href="https://petapixel.com/2022/05/11/how-sandisk-made-its-new-sd-cards-faster-than-should-be-possible/">proprietary tech</a> and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like <a data-i13n="cpos:48;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">Valve’s Steam Deck</a>.</p> 
<p>UHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the <a data-i13n="cpos:49;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it.</p> 
<p>UHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo <a data-i13n="cpos:50;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2/#:~:text=Kawamoto%3A%20Because%20we,buying%20the%20system.">needs more</a>. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run <a data-i13n="cpos:51;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/cyberpunk-2077-and-split-fiction-are-third-party-launch-titles-for-nintendo-switch-2-135648661.html">demanding games</a> that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device <a data-i13n="cpos:52;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/">also uses</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:53;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Flash_Storage">UFS 3.1</a> storage internally, which is much speedier than the <a data-i13n="cpos:54;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#eMMC">eMMC</a> storage used by the original Switch. (A custom <a data-i13n="cpos:55;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed#:~:text=While%20the%20Switch,for%20the%20CPU.">file decompression engine</a> helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games.</p>

<p>Hence, SD Express. This standard has <a data-i13n="cpos:56;pos:1" href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/five-years-of-sd-express-a-milestone-of-innovation/">technically been around</a> since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by <a data-i13n="cpos:57;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html">modern SSDs</a>. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current <a data-i13n="cpos:58;pos:1" href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/bus-speed-default-speed-high-speed-uhs-sd-express/">theoretical maximum</a> of 985 MB/s.</p> 
<p>As noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used <a data-i13n="cpos:59;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html">by the PS5</a> and Xbox. (<a data-i13n="cpos:60;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/">Sony recommends</a> SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s.</p> 
<p>But they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, <a data-i13n="cpos:61;pos:1" href="https://americas.lexar.com/product/lexar-professional-silver-plus-microsdxc-uhs-i-card/">Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus</a> — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used.</p> 
<p>It remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with years of use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:SanDisk;elmt:;cpos:62;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f45797c5-bae4-4ba9-9419-9454e07b099d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2df5caaa-9798-4115-a8f0-26050980cc10&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=SanDisk&amp;linkText=pricey+external+reader&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3Auc2FuZGlzay5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmQtcmVhZGVycy9zYW5kaXNrLXByby1yZWFkZXItc2QtZXhwcmVzcy1kdWFsLWNhcmQ_c2t1PVNERFItQTQ1MS1HTlBOTiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmRmNWNhYWEtOTc5OC00MTE1LWE4ZjAtMjYwNTA5ODBjYzEwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3Auc2FuZGlzay5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmQtcmVhZGVycy9zYW5kaXNrLXByby1yZWFkZXItc2QtZXhwcmVzcy1kdWFsLWNhcmQ_c2t1PVNERFItQTQ1MS1HTlBOTiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZiW7fgmTUUdao9xu_-GoC-6D5h1nIqgzhoRw5LXMc2V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.sandisk.com%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fmemory-card-readers%2Fsandisk-pro-reader-sd-express-dual-card%3Fsku%3DSDDR-A451-GNPNN" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shop.sandisk.com/products/accessories/memory-card-readers/sandisk-pro-reader-sd-express-dual-card?sku=SDDR-A451-GNPNN">pricey external reader</a>).

<p>We put our microSD Express cards through a series of tests meant to simulate how people would use each card on the Switch 2 in the real world. We mainly worked with four games: a mid-sized title in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a small one in <em>Fast Fusion</em>, a relatively large one in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and a hybrid in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, which ran off a Switch 1 cartridge but used a roughly 10GB Switch 2 upgrade pack that was downloaded and installed digitally.</p> 
<p>We first timed how long it took to move each game from the system’s internal storage to the card in question, and vice versa. We then timed how long it took to load each game when installed to a given card. After that, we measured how quickly the cards could load certain in-game scenarios: the first Grand Prix race in <em>Mario Kart</em>; the first championship race in <em>Fast Fusion</em>; fast traveling between the Jig-Jig Street, <a data-i13n="cpos:63;pos:1" href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Embers">Embers</a> and Downtown Central areas in <em>Cyberpunk</em> and fast traveling between the Kakariko Village, Korok Forest and the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins areas in <em>Zelda</em>. (We chose those places in the latter two games because they’re more taxing than other regions.) With <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>Zelda</em>, we also timed how long it took to load up different save files in those locations.</p> 
<p>With each test, we completed three to five runs to account for any irregularities and marked down the average time taken between them. We did each test in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off, to minimize any performance drain that could arise from background downloads. Between each test, we also spent at least an hour playing the games off each card to ensure there were no significant drop-offs compared to the console’s built-in storage.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-recent-updates">Recent updates</h2> 
<p><strong>December 2025</strong>: We’ve tested Samsung’s P9 Express card, though our general shopping advice for this market remains the same.</p> 
<p><strong>November 2025</strong>: We’ve tested the 256GB version of Walmart’s Onn microSD Express card and edited our guide accordingly. It’s generally slower than most of the other options we’ve tried, especially when moving games to and from system storage, and in synthetic benchmark tests on a PC. But the performance drop-off isn’t particularly noticeable in actual Switch 2 games, so if you see it in stock and just want to pay as little as possible, it’s a decent buy.</p> 
<p><strong>September 2025:</strong> We’ve taken another pass through this guide to confirm our advice is still accurate. We’ve also noted a new 512GB version of PNY’s microSD Express card and confirmed that a “<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:;cpos:64;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;itemId=walmart_transaction_16003402425&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2df5caaa-9798-4115-a8f0-26050980cc10&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=SanDisk+GamePlay&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9pcC9TYW5EaXNrLTUxMkdCLUdhbWVQTEFZLW1pY3JvU0QtRXhwcmVzcy1DYXJkLzE2MDAzNDAyNDI1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZGY1Y2FhYS05Nzk4LTQxMTUtYThmMC0yNjA1MDk4MGNjMTAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL2lwL1NhbkRpc2stNTEyR0ItR2FtZVBMQVktbWljcm9TRC1FeHByZXNzLUNhcmQvMTYwMDM0MDI0MjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZavPbTb8kqr5RbjCx-bsM6y2MeRL7EbrR2oF7vUmQa6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSanDisk-512GB-GamePLAY-microSD-Express-Card%2F16003402425" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SanDisk-512GB-GamePLAY-microSD-Express-Card/16003402425">SanDisk GamePlay</a>” Express card sold at Walmart has the same performance as the standard SanDisk model we recommend above, just with a different name.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Setting up a PS5 for a child means you can offer an age-appropriate and safe platform for them to play. Sony made its parental control tools more comprehensive in recent years and they allow families to manage screen time, block unsuitable content, guide online interactions and approve purchases. The process is straightforward once the right menus are in view, but it helps to understand how each feature works before handing over the controller.</p>
<p>The system uses individual accounts for each family member, and these accounts determine what a child can access. A parent or guardian assigns restrictions to the child’s profile and the console enforces them more consistently than earlier PlayStation systems. The process begins with creating a child account, then linking it to the Family Management section of the adult account, and finally adjusting controls on the console itself.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-create-a-child-account-through-family-management"><strong>Create a child account through Family Management</strong></h2>
<p>A child account is required before you can use any parental controls. This account is linked to the family manager’s PlayStation account and cannot be converted into an adult account until the child reaches the appropriate age under local regulations.</p>
<p>From the PS5 Home screen, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Family and Parental Controls </strong>then choose <strong>Family Management</strong>. The system will request the family manager’s password before any changes can be made. Select <strong>Add Family Member</strong> and choose <strong>Add a Child</strong>. The console generates a QR code that opens a secure PlayStation webpage on a phone or browser. This page guides the setup process and ties the new account to the family group.</p>
<p>The form asks for the child’s date of birth first. Sony uses this to assign default age restrictions and to determine which features are allowed. A small credit card charge may be requested to verify the adult’s identity. The next steps involve entering an email address for the child, creating a password and selecting basic settings for content access, communication and spending. The child account must then be verified through a link sent to the provided email address. This ensures the account can use PlayStation Network features including any future purchases through the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>Once complete, the new profile appears in the Family Management list on the PS5. This profile is now ready for fine-tuning.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-manage-parental-controls-on-the-console"><strong>Manage parental controls on the console</strong></h2>
<p>The PS5 keeps all parental controls in Family and Parental Controls within the main Settings menu. This section is organized into Playtime Settings, Content Restrictions, Communication and User-Generated Content and Spending controls. Each area can be adjusted separately for every child account in the family group.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-set-limits-on-playtime"><strong>How to set limits on playtime</strong></h2>
<p>Playtime controls help set boundaries for gaming sessions. Select the child’s profile, then open <strong>Playtime Settings</strong>. Limits can be set by total daily hours or by specific time windows. The console can be configured to notify the child when time is nearly up, or to log them out automatically once the limit is reached. These settings apply across the child’s account, so they remain active even if the child switches between PS5 consoles in the same household.</p>
<p>Parents can choose how strictly the system enforces these rules. For example, the console can continue to display warnings without blocking gameplay or it can stop activity when the allotted time ends. Playtime reports can also be viewed through the family manager’s PlayStation account or the PS App.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-restrict-content-based-on-age-ratings"><strong>How to restrict content based on age ratings</strong></h2>
<p>Sony’s content filters are based on age ratings from the ESRB in the United States and equivalent regional boards in other countries. In <strong>Family Management</strong>, select the child’s profile and then select <strong>Parental Controls</strong>. Here, parents can set an age level for games. Titles above this level will not launch without approval from the family manager.</p>
<p>Blu-ray and DVD content can also be restricted and the system browser can be disabled entirely. If the family uses services that stream movies or TV shows through the console, those apps often apply their own content filters, but the PS5 can serve as a first line of control.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-manage-communication-and-online-interactions"><strong>How to manage communication and online interactions</strong></h2>
<p>Online communication can be limited to prevent unwanted contact. In <strong>Parental Controls</strong>, select <strong>Communication and User-Generated Content</strong>. This area controls messaging, voice chat, profile sharing and the ability to see or share player-created media such as screenshots and video clips.</p>
<p>Online play can also be adjusted. For younger kids, it may be helpful to block online multiplayer entirely until they better understand online etiquette and safety. For older children, communication can be limited to friends only. The PS5 respects these limits across all supported games.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-set-spending-limits-for-purchases"><strong>How to set spending limits for purchases</strong></h2>
<p>A child account cannot use payment cards directly, but it can spend funds from the family manager’s wallet. Spending limits can be set in the child’s profile under Family Management. Parents can choose a monthly spending cap or block purchases altogether. Any attempt to exceed the limit requires approval from the family manager.</p>
<p>This feature covers games, add-ons, subscriptions and in-game currency. It ensures surprises on the credit card are less likely, especially in titles that promote quick digital purchases.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-sign-your-child-into-the-ps5"><strong>How to sign your child into the PS5</strong></h2>
<p>Once controls are set, the child can be added as a user on the console. Return to the home screen and select the user icon to switch users. Choose <strong>Add User</strong>, then select <strong>Get Started</strong>. Sign in using the child account’s email address and password.</p>
<p>The console guides the profile setup process and prompts for an online ID, avatar and privacy preferences. These steps help personalise the child’s space on the PS5. The system may request a locally created passcode that prevents access to parental controls without the family manager’s approval. This passcode should be unique and not shared with the child.</p>
<p>After setup is complete, the child will see a version of the PS5 tailored to the restrictions applied. Games that exceed the assigned age rating will appear with a lock icon and the console will block any actions that the family manager has limited.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-use-the-ps-app-and-playstations-online-tools-for-ongoing-management"><strong>Use the PS App and PlayStation’s online tools for ongoing management</strong></h2>
<p>Playtime and permissions can be managed remotely through Sony’s PS App or the PlayStation website. This makes it easier to adjust rules without taking over the TV. The app also provides notifications when playtime is running low or when the child attempts to access restricted content.</p>
<p>Sony’s Family Management tools synchronise across devices. Changes made from a phone appear on the PS5 within seconds. This helps maintain consistent rules, especially in homes with more than one console.</p>
<p>A child-ready PS5 is more than a restriction tool. It creates a safer environment for learning how to navigate digital spaces, interact with friends and handle screen time. Sony’s updated controls take much of the pressure off parents by enforcing rules in predictable ways that are difficult to bypass. Once everything is configured, the child can enjoy the console’s library while staying within the boundaries that support healthy gaming habits.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-set-up-a-ps5-for-a-child-160039866.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Upgrading to the Switch 2 is a big step forward, thanks to the larger screen, new features and improved performance. But shifting to a new console naturally raises the question of what happens to all your games and save data on the one you already have. Thankfully, Nintendo has built a clear <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">System Transfer</a> process that lets you move your account, digital purchases, save files and other key data from your original Switch to the Switch 2. If you prepare ahead of time, you can be back to playing your favorite titles on new hardware in minutes.</p><p>We’ll walk you through everything you need to know, including what transfers, how to start the process and what to check once you’re set up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="3dfe3624-a994-4b63-99b4-fad2f96c1ada">Before you transfer: A quick checklist</h2><p>Running through these steps first will save you time later:</p><ul><li><p>Charge your original Switch and your Switch 2, and keep them near each other.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a stable Wi-Fi connection, as this is required to verify your Nintendo Account and manage redownloads.</p></li><li><p>Update your original Switch by installing the latest system software so the transfer can run without interruptions.</p></li><li><p>Confirm your Nintendo Account is linked, and each user you want to move is tied to a Nintendo Account.</p></li><li><p>Most Switch titles work on Switch 2, but a few may have issues, so it’s worth checking <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Nintendo’s compatibility list</a> ahead of time.</p></li><li><p>Back up screenshots and videos if needed. These should transfer, but it never hurts to have your own copy.</p></li></ul><h2 id="891d7969-dd53-4f00-aadf-b7f103a15903">How to start the transfer of data from your old Switch to the Switch 2</h2><p>With your original Nintendo Switch to hand, navigate to <strong>System Settings</strong>, select <strong>Users</strong> then select <strong>Transfer Your User &amp; Save Data</strong>. Pick the user profile you want to move, confirm your Nintendo Account information and follow the on-screen prompts.</p><p>Power on your Switch 2 and go through the initial setup. When the console asks if you want to transfer data from another system, select <strong>Start System Transfer</strong>. Make sure both consoles are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and remain powered on during the process.</p><p>Once the Switch 2 detects your original console, it will guide you through pairing the systems for the transfer. After the connection is established the original Switch will begin sending your user information, save data and settings.</p><p>When the transfer is complete, your new console will automatically log in using your Nintendo Account. Your digital games will appear in the <strong>Redownload</strong> section of the eShop so you can pull them onto your Switch 2 as needed.</p><h2 id="29c233fd-4d3e-499d-a230-9610a6f53319">What to do after your transfer is complete</h2><p>Once everything has moved to the Switch 2, there are a few final steps that help round out the process. You can redownload your digital games from the eShop and start reinstalling your favorites. Any controllers, Joy-Con or Bluetooth accessories you used with your original console will need to be paired again (provided they are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-070011952.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Switch 2-compatible accessories</a>), which only takes a minute. It’s also a good time to update your games to their latest versions and restore any parental controls or family group settings you had before.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’re confident that all your data has transferred and everything is working as expected, you can then decide whether to keep your old console, hand it down or perform a factory reset if you plan to sell it.</p><h2 id="befe0488-a5e3-439e-aa5d-82588c531b8c">What data transfers to the Switch 2</h2><p>Nintendo’s System Transfer moves everything tied to your Nintendo Account, including digital games you’ve purchased, save data, user profiles, parental controls, system settings and screenshots and video captures.&nbsp;</p><p>Your Nintendo Switch Online membership moves as well, and you’ll be able to immediately re-download your digital games on the Switch 2 once the transfer completes. Physical Switch game cards also work on the new console, though some titles may require patches or updates for the best performance. Nintendo has noted that a small number of older games may have temporary compatibility issues, but these are being reviewed.</p><h2 id="7e9a71ec-e7f4-47b9-a453-c1debd2cdada">What data doesn’t transfer automatically</h2><p>A few settings won’t carry over on their own, so you may need to handle them manually once your Switch 2 is set up. Bluetooth pairing for controllers or headphones will need to be reconnected, since those device links stay tied to the original console. Your Wi-Fi passwords also won’t transfer, so you’ll have to sign in to your home network again.&nbsp;</p><p>Some game-specific preferences, as well as language or region settings, may require another quick adjustment on the Switch 2, but these are simple to reconfigure and only take a few moments.</p><h2 id="cf32dad8-d241-4151-95c7-5ab4e46a8d2f">Troubleshooting and other things to consider</h2><p>If you run into issues while getting settled, a few common scenarios are worth keeping in mind. Some older titles may have temporary compatibility problems on the new console, so if a game behaves unexpectedly, check <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Nintendo’s updated compatibility list</a> for known issues.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also notice slower download speeds as the Switch 2 queues up your full library after the transfer. It helps to prioritize the games you want to play first so they can download ahead of the rest. Storage can also play a role. If you use a microSD card, wait until the system transfer is complete before inserting it into the new console, since the Switch 2 may need to reformat the card.&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, don’t reset your old Switch right away. Keeping it powered on and accessible ensures you can confirm that all your saves and data made it across safely.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-transfer-your-games-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000702.html?src=rss]]></description>

Valve didn’t acknowledge the outage publicly, but SteamDB’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://steamstat.us/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">unofficial Steam Status page</a> reported that the Steam Store, Steam Community, and Steam Web APIs were all offline.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/steam/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">DownDetector</a> received over 6,000 outage reports around 1:15PM ET, and Steam was also inaccessible from Valve’s mobile apps. The outage appears to have affected APIs for Valve’s online games, like <em>Team Fortress 2, Dota 2</em> and <em>Counterstrike 2, </em>as well.</p><p>By around 4PM ET, Steam itself had begun to rebound, and as of 6PM ET, the platform had largely recovered, with the main PC, mobile and Mac clients broadly fully functional, but ocassionally erroring out. There are still parts of the service that are extremely sluggish and, according to SteamDB, many of Valve’s online games are down or only partially functional. Upon checking at 4AM on  December 25, all services seem to have been restored. The Steam Web API, Store and Community are working normally, and all games are running as usual. </p><p>Steam’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-is-back-online-after-outage-170514965.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">last major outage</a> was in October, when the store and online services were unavailable for an hour.

<p><strong>Read our full guide to the </strong><a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html"><strong>best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a></p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options.</p> 
<p>Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach.</p> 
<p>We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">separate Switch 2 guide</a>, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy.</p>

Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter.</p> 
<p>What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards <em>should</em> (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on.</p> 
<p>There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market.</p> 
<p>With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds.</p> 
<p>It all adds up to performance that&#39;s at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater.

<h3 id="jump-link-read-and-write-speeds">Read and write speeds</h3> 
<p>MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds.</p> 
<p>These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device.</p> 
<p>Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the <a data-i13n="cpos:55;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-speed-ratings">Speed ratings</h3> 
<p>If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s <a data-i13n="cpos:56;pos:1" href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/">speed class</a> and performance ratings, which are determined by the <a data-i13n="cpos:57;pos:1" href="https://www.sdcard.org/">SD Association</a>.</p> 
<p>A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost.</p> 
<p>The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s.</p> 
<p>The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards.</p> 
<p>The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s.</p> 
<p>To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today.</p> 
<p>It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-uhs-bus-speeds">UHS bus speeds</h3> 
<p>The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II.</p> 
<p>UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time.</p> 
<p>However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:;cpos:58;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;linkText=128GB+Lexar+Professional+Gold&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xNzkzMzcxLVJFRy9sZXhhcl9sbXNnb2xkMTI4Z19ibm5uZ18xMjhnYl9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxfZ29sZF9taWNyb3NkeGMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xNzkzMzcxLVJFRy9sZXhhcl9sbXNnb2xkMTI4Z19ibm5uZ18xMjhnYl9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxfZ29sZF9taWNyb3NkeGMuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZCQLJCaXg-xEzPrC4Qb_Sfvns0Klfc_o4OPsadFGvTC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1793371-REG%2Flexar_lmsgold128g_bnnng_128gb_professional_gold_microsdxc.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xNzkzMzcxLVJFRy9sZXhhcl9sbXNnb2xkMTI4Z19ibm5uZ18xMjhnYl9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxfZ29sZF9taWNyb3NkeGMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xNzkzMzcxLVJFRy9sZXhhcl9sbXNnb2xkMTI4Z19ibm5uZ18xMjhnYl9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxfZ29sZF9taWNyb3NkeGMuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZCQLJCaXg-xEzPrC4Qb_Sfvns0Klfc_o4OPsadFGvTC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1793371-REG%2Flexar_lmsgold128g_bnnng_128gb_professional_gold_microsdxc.html&amp;refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fcomputing%2Faccessories%2Fbest-microsd-card-130038282.html&amp;uuid=6snSMKg4JwD8JRwW19544">128GB Lexar Professional Gold</a> model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35.

You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations.</p>

That’s quicker than some older SSDs.</p> 
<p>It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the <a data-i13n="cpos:64;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which is <a data-i13n="cpos:65;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-promises-major-storage-upgrades-but-itll-cost-you-193758964.html"><em>only</em> compatible</a> with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games.</p> 
<p>Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down.</p> 
<p>But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-a-note-on-card-readers-and-reaching-advertised-speeds">A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds</h3> 
<p>While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: <a data-i13n="cpos:67;pos:1" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22481/~/microsd-card-faq">Both</a> of <a data-i13n="cpos:68;pos:1" href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech">those</a> gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces.</p> 
<p>The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-warranty">Warranty</h3> 
<p>Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:69;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=Samsung%27s+Pro+Endurance&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9jb21wdXRpbmcvbWVtb3J5LXN0b3JhZ2UvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmRzL3Byby1lbmR1cmFuY2UtYWRhcHRlci1taWNyb3NkeGMtMjU2Z2ItbWItbWoyNTZrYS1hbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY0MTFjYWRhLTNmMWUtNDg3ZC04ZDlhLWNiNWQzMGMxOWZiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvY29tcHV0aW5nL21lbW9yeS1zdG9yYWdlL21lbW9yeS1jYXJkcy9wcm8tZW5kdXJhbmNlLWFkYXB0ZXItbWljcm9zZHhjLTI1NmdiLW1iLW1qMjU2a2EtYW0vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcllRIX3DZuYIbvhGrQFIv7FHWlCKx1-FShaN--m5dJQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmemory-storage%2Fmemory-cards%2Fpro-endurance-adapter-microsdxc-256gb-mb-mj256ka-am%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/pro-endurance-adapter-microsdxc-256gb-mb-mj256ka-am/">Samsung&#39;s Pro Endurance</a>, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-avoiding-counterfeits">Avoiding counterfeits</h3> 
<p>The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper <em>and</em> seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users <a data-i13n="cpos:70;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/dz3h6z/amazon_still_selling_fake_microsd_cards_even_if/">have reported</a> receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else.</p> 
<p>Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like <a data-i13n="cpos:71;pos:1" href="https://crystalmark.info/en/">CrystalDiskMark</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:72;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=BlackMagic+Disk+Speed+Test&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9ibGFja21hZ2ljLWRpc2stc3BlZWQtdGVzdC9pZDQyNTI2NDU1MD9tdD0xMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9ibGFja21hZ2ljLWRpc2stc3BlZWQtdGVzdC9pZDQyNTI2NDU1MD9tdD0xMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAV-MT-_Cxc_IVGVKkSni1obntDX_NuMHjIa6GSG99qxo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fblackmagic-disk-speed-test%2Fid425264550%3Fmt%3D12" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9ibGFja21hZ2ljLWRpc2stc3BlZWQtdGVzdC9pZDQyNTI2NDU1MD9tdD0xMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAActngcAbGFJX7nyX4-HIJ1_WXXD3RN5G-OqiyGzawnQ0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fblackmagic-disk-speed-test%2Fid425264550%3Fmt%3D12">BlackMagic Disk Speed Test</a> to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs).

<p><strong>May 2025</strong>: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select. We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update.</p> 
<p><strong>February 2025</strong>: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Western Digital;elmt:;cpos:87;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=92bbc6e1-f32c-4060-9f86-b3358db79a39&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Western+Digital&amp;linkText=Apex+Legends+card&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXN0ZXJuZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZW4tc2cvcHJvZHVjdHMvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmRzL3NhbmRpc2stYXBleC1sZWdlbmRzLW5pbnRlbmRvLXN3aXRjaC1taWNyb3NkP3NrdT1TRFNRWEFPLTEyOEctR042WlkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY0MTFjYWRhLTNmMWUtNDg3ZC04ZDlhLWNiNWQzMGMxOWZiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VzdGVybmRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL2VuLXNnL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21lbW9yeS1jYXJkcy9zYW5kaXNrLWFwZXgtbGVnZW5kcy1uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gtbWljcm9zZD9za3U9U0RTUVhBTy0xMjhHLUdONlpZIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAR4C3d1JhfEP-izck2qevetGhec4AmuWhcvXalipOOvF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fen-sg%2Fproducts%2Fmemory-cards%2Fsandisk-apex-legends-nintendo-switch-microsd%3Fsku%3DSDSQXAO-128G-GN6ZY" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.westerndigital.com/en-sg/products/memory-cards/sandisk-apex-legends-nintendo-switch-microsd?sku=SDSQXAO-128G-GN6ZY"><em>Apex Legends</em> card</a>, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases.</p>

<p><strong>August 2024</strong>: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select.

<p>If the costs here still sound a bit high, that&#39;s because Sony <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-raises-ps5-console-prices-in-the-us-153429564.html"><ins>raised console prices by $50</ins></a> back in August. In other words, these $100 discounts are pretty much $50 discounts when factoring in that recent increase. Still, cheaper is cheaper. This puts the digital PS5 at the same price as an Xbox Series S and the disc-based version at the same price as a Switch 2.</p> 
<p>Both standard PS5 configurations won&#39;t arrive until December 28. The PS5 Pro, however, is available for same-day shipping if you&#39;re jonesing for one last holiday gift.</p>
