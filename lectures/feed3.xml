                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has announced a raft of new hardware, including a new VR headset, Steam Machine and Controller. The devices are all designed to usher in a new era of PC gaming, with Valve’s usual focus on the player. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html"><ins>Steam Frame</ins></a> is a slender VR headset that connects wirelessly to your PC and has a built-in battery to rid you of those pesky cables. That focus on freedom extends to the Frame operating as a standalone device, like the Meta Quest.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company has revived its long-loved (but not massively successful) <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html"><ins>Steam Machine</ins></a>. This new model has semi-custom AMD silicon capable of running 4K games at 60 frames per second. Valve says it’s roughly six times as powerful as its portable unit, the Steam Deck. Rounding out the list is the controller, which looks like a Steam Deck with the screen cut out. But it’s not as if that’s a bad thing, especially as it’s got TMR sensors which, while using a different underlying technology, promise the same benefits as a Hall Effect stick.</p>
<p>As someone on the not particularly game-y end of the spectrum, I use announcements like this as an exercise to see how excited <em>I would be</em>. To that end, I’m curious how much Valve will charge for this gear when it makes its debut early next year. On one hand, the performance promises laid out here are fairly substantial but, on the other, this is also a company that sells the base model Steam Deck for less than a Switch 2.</p>
<p>That said, I would certainly get off the couch if there was a new Half-Life game in the works, and that seems plausible here. Nathan Ingraham is certainly getting his little hopes up that the revival of the Steam Machine <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html"><ins>might see Valve revive something else</ins></a> too.</p>

Thanks to a streaming benefit for subscribers, you can then sign up for Peacock at no extra cost.</p> 
<p>Walmart+ subscribers are able to choose between a Peacock Premium or a Paramount+ Essential subscription. Considering Peacock premium would run you $110 for the year on its own, signing up for Walmart+ while this discount is available gets you access to the streaming service for less than half the normal cost.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

Here are the best power banks you can buy, with picks ranging from small MagSafe packs to massive laptop batteries and everything in between.</p>

<p>You may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Independent;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1149d18a-366d-41e7-9cfa-7ce4d0fd6835&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Independent&amp;linkText=just+such+a+thing+happened&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy1hbmQtYWR2aWNlL2hvbmcta29uZy1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1iYW5rLWIyNzE5MTY0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL25ld3MtYW5kLWFkdmljZS9ob25nLWtvbmctYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWZpcmUtcG93ZXItYmFuay1iMjcxOTE2NC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeU3AdLXhHs4rETBPmT2Fa8cfZB6yJ3Rqk5g0VxDNdcc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fnews-and-advice%2Fhong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/hong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html">just such a thing happened</a> in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-100-watt-hours-or-less-device">TSA</a> still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.</p> 
<p>Recently, Southwest Airlines was the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk">first in the industry</a> to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-capacity"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> 
<p>Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html">separate guide</a> that covers that entire category.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.</p> 
<p>You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wireless"><strong>Wireless</strong></h3> 
<p>Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhKVuT8-H1g">less efficient</a> than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank.</p> 
<p>Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/qi2/">Qi2</a> wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved.</p> 
<p>To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points. The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.facebook.com/Engadget/posts/the-best-magsafe-power-banks-for-your-iphone-httpsengtco4m1eij4/1307571497704209/">MagSafe</a> technology on iPhones were once the only handsets that were Qi2-compatible, but now Google’s <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixelsnap-is-googles-qi2-powered-answer-to-magsafe-for-the-pixel-10-series-160048306.html">Pixelsnap</a> tech brings both the higher speed and magnetic grip to Pixel 10 phones. Samsung may follow up with its own version in future releases.</p> 
<p>The latest wireless charging standard, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qi2-25w-wireless-charging-is-coming-to-iphones-and-major-android-smartphones-183013979.html">Q12 25W</a>, is supported by the new iPhone 17 phones as well as the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. Battery packs that are Qi2 25W-enabled are starting to hit the market as well, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0F37VLJQW&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1149d18a-366d-41e7-9cfa-7ce4d0fd6835&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Ugreen+MagFlow&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1VHUkVFTi1DZXJ0aWZpZWQtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ2hhcmdpbmctTWFnbmV0aWMvZHAvQjBGMzdWTEpRVy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTE0OWQxOGEtMzY2ZC00MWU3LTljZmEtN2NlNGQwZmQ2ODM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1VHUkVFTi1DZXJ0aWZpZWQtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ2hhcmdpbmctTWFnbmV0aWMvZHAvQjBGMzdWTEpRVy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT5A6QiOsKjUzeVpMblmEuHnfvE255GORR36nzi3S2fn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Certified-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic%2Fdp%2FB0F37VLJQW%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Certified-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic/dp/B0F37VLJQW/">Ugreen MagFlow</a> was the first on the scene.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> 
<p>USB-C ports can deliver faster charges than USB-A ports, and most of the portable chargers we recommend here have Type-C connections. But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind).</p> 
<p>There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them).</p> 
<p>As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds.</p> 
<p>Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along.</p> 
<p><strong>Design</strong></p> 
<p>Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-best-power-banks">How we test best power banks</h2> 
<p>Before I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office.</p>

<p>We&#39;re continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer).</p> 
<p>I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used a 140W cable from Anker.</p> 
<p>For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing:</p>

I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful.</p>

It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up.</p>

It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-power-bank-faqs">Power bank FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-portable-power-bank-and-a-portable-charger"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger?</strong></h3> 
<p>A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.</p> 
<p>Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-fast-charging-actually-ruin-your-battery"><strong>Does fast charging actually ruin your battery?</strong></h3> 
<p>Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.</p> 
<p>While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a <a data-i13n="cpos:73;pos:1" href="https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/vehiclebatteries/FastChargeEffects.pdf">study on EV batteries</a> (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.</p> 
<p>In short, fast charging could be <em>slightly</em> harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-use-a-power-bank-for-all-your-devices"><strong>Can you use a power bank for all your devices?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery.

That brings the cost of a full year down to $35, giving you access to guided meditations, courses and stress-management tools that can help you stay balanced heading into the new year.</p> 
<p>Headspace has become one of the most recognizable names in digital mindfulness. The app blends practical meditation guidance with structured courses and calming soundscapes designed to make everyday stress easier to manage. Its programs cover everything from beginner-friendly introductions to mindfulness to focused content on topics like anxiety, productivity and sleep.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Subscribers get access to hundreds of guided sessions led by the Headspace team, including short daily practices that can be completed in a few spare minutes, plus longer courses that help build consistency. The app’s Sleepcasts and soundscapes are unique, designed to create a steady nighttime routine that promotes better rest. For mornings, there are breathing exercises and motivational mini-sessions that can help set focus for the day ahead.</p> 
<p>Headspace also includes personalized progress tracking, mood check-ins and optional reminders that make it easier to stay consistent with your new mindfulness habits. For anyone new to meditation, the app’s clear structure is a major strength. You don’t have to know where to start, since it suggests sessions based on your goals or current mood.</p> 
<p>This annual deal is ideal for users who want to stick with mindfulness practice over time, or anyone interested in incorporating a new habit into their lives. Paying for the year upfront typically saves money compared with the monthly plan, and the discount brings that cost down even further. Whether you’re learning the basics of meditation or refining an existing routine, the full library provides enough variety to keep things engaging throughout the year.</p>

Like group chats in messaging apps, you can create conversations with friends and family. In this instance, though, ChatGPT is one of the participants, building an itinerary as you plan a vacation, giving you ideas for renovation projects or helping you find a restaurant everyone in the chat would enjoy if you’re planning a night out. You can also use the feature to collaborate with classmates or colleagues. ChatGPT, for example, can outline reports based on the articles and notes you and your collaborator give it. </p><p>To start a group chat, you have to tap on the people icon at the top right corner of the screen on any new and existing conversation. ChatGPT will create a new conversation without your chat history if you start from an existing chat. You can then add people or share a link to the group conversation with one to 20 persons, who then have to set up a profile with their name, username and a photo. Take note that anybody who has the link can invite people in, and participants can mute or remove other participants from the chat anytime except for the group creator. And if anybody in the chat is under 18, the chatbot automatically limits sensitive content for everyone. </p><p>Group chat responses are powered by GPT‑5.1 Auto, which can choose which model to respond with based on the prompt. OpenAI says it taught the chatbot to follow the flow of group conversations, so it knows when to stay quiet and when to respond, but participants can always summon the chatbot by mentioning “ChatGPT.” The company also says that it will continue tweaking the feature based on feedback from early users before it’s rolled out widely. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-piloting-group-conversations-in-chatgpt-053255102.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin&#39;s New Glenn rocket has completed its second flight, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/13/new-glenn-blue-origin-nasa-launch/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>The Washington Post</em> reports</a>. The rocket launched from Florida&#39;s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Thursday, and successfully separated from its first-stage booster, which later landed on a sea platform Blue Origin calls &quot;Jacklyn.&quot;</p><p>The launch marks the first time the space startup has been able to catch a New Glenn booster for later reuse. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-launches-into-orbit-on-its-maiden-flight-073451555.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">maiden flight</a> of the rocket in January was successful in the sense that it got New Glenn into space, but Blue Origin wasn&#39;t able to save the booster from a watery grave. The company hoped to launch its second New Glenn mission on November 9, but <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origin-scrubs-new-glenns-second-flight-due-to-bad-weather-214349212.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">cancelled it</a> last minute due to weather.</p><p>New Glenn&#39;s second mission is also notable because of its payload: The rocket ferried <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/blue-origins-second-new-glenn-launch-will-carry-real-nasa-satellites-153000627.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">NASA satellites</a> to space that are destined for Mars as part of the agency&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/escapade/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">ESCAPADE mission</a>. Considering SpaceX&#39;s close relationship with NASA, Blue Origin working with the agency could be an important vote of confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also mean New Glenn is in a good position to help another company founded by Jeff Bezos accelerate its satellite plans. <em>The Post</em> writes that Blue Origin has an existing agreement with Amazon to launch its recently rebranded <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Amazon Leo</a> satellites into space. Leo is positioned as a competitor to Starlink, SpaceX&#39;s satellite internet service.</p><p>While SpaceX has completed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-will-attempt-starships-11th-flight-test-on-monday-204237829.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">many more launches</a> with its Starship rocket than Blue Origin has, it&#39;s also had more than a few <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">explosive failures</a> along the way. Blue Origin still needs more missions under its belt, but if it can repeat its success with New Glenn, it could prove to be a threat to SpaceX.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-safely-made-it-to-space-a-second-time-230324439.html?src=rss]]></description>

This will be an opt-in space for chatting with an AI assistant and getting help from it while browsing. The goal with this project appears to be giving users more control over when and how they choose to interact with AI. AI Window will be another option for users alongside the standard Firefox window and the Private Window, which will continue to offer more privacy protections. The feature is still in development, so interested users can sign up in Mozilla&#39;s blog post to be among the first users and provide feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>AI built into browsers is one of the current hot issues among tech companies. Every browser provider and AI operation appears to be engaged in an arms race to offer the best integrated solution. Mozilla isn&#39;t immune to that push; it also introduced an iOS tool for Firefox earlier this year where you can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/firefox-provides-ai-page-summaries-if-you-shake-your-iphone-145837557.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shake your phone</a> to get an AI-generated summary of a web page. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mozilla-will-add-an-ai-window-to-firefox-225032453.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>
<p>Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html">VPN deal</a> this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to Proton VPN.</p>

Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.</p></li>

Under the App Store Mini Apps Partner Program, devs would pay a reduced rate of 15 percent, compared to the current 30 percent, on qualifying in-app purchases. Apple has a bunch of more <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">detailed explanations</a> and an FAQ about how the partner program will work and what mini apps are eligible.&nbsp;</p><p>Mini apps are "self-contained experiences" — often web-based games — that live within a larger "host" app. Apple has allowed developers to offer these experiences for years, but only allowed mini app developers to support in-app purchases of their own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-lets-apps-feature-streaming-games-chatbots-and-other-built-in-experiences-180016453.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">last year</a>. </p><p>In order to participate in the Mini Apps Partner Program, developers will need to meet a few additional requirements. To start, developers will need to support both iOS and iPadsOS functionality. They're also required to implement Apple's Advanced Commerce API, as well as the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-explains-how-it-will-comply-with-app-store-age-verification-requirements-in-texas-185934469.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Declared Age Range API</a>. The latter requirement would prevent underage users from circumventing parental controls by accessing a mini app with a higher age rating than the host app. </p><p>Apple's fee structure has been an ongoing subject of debate, and the company has faced global pressure from regulators to change its commission policies to prove it isn't engaged in monopolistic, anti-competitive practices. We've already seen some changes at Apple this year, as its legal saga with Epic Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/court-orders-apple-to-stop-collecting-fees-for-purchases-made-outside-the-app-store-110036376.html" data-i13n="slk:wound towards a conclusion;cpos:5;pos:1">wound towards a conclusion</a> and some of the App Store guidelines were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-allow-external-payment-options-123039994.html" data-i13n="slk:changed;cpos:6;pos:1">changed</a> to allow for external payment options.</p><p><strong>Update, November 13, 2025, 2PM PT:</strong> Added additional details about the Mini Apps Partner Program.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-halves-app-store-fees-for-mini-apps-190251153.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-04-amazon-internet-satellite-network-project-kuiper.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">introduced the project</a> in 2019 with the goal of offering internet in regions without a reliable connection, through a proposed constellation of over 3,000 satellites that could blanket 95 percent of the global population in high-speed internet. That constellation has yet to fully take shape, however. In the years following the Project Kuiper reveal, Amazon launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-first-internet-satellite-launch-was-a-success-202130763.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">prototype satellites</a>, detailed plans for a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-boosts-its-satellite-internet-network-with-the-help-of-space-lasers-123535946.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">space laser mesh network</a> and showed off <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-satellite-internet-antennas-can-double-as-picnic-tables-for-dolls-153450879.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the antennas</a> customers will use to connect to its network, but it didn&#39;t actually <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-deploys-the-first-project-kuiper-internet-satellites-140006298.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">launch the first 27 satellites</a> in its constellation until April 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, its competitor Starlink has had a much faster expansion. SpaceX launched the Starlink satellite internet service in beta in 2020, and has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">rapidly expanded it</a> since then. Now SpaceX has a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/t-mobile-is-offering-its-starlink-satellite-texting-feature-for-free-until-july-130044054.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">deal with T-Mobile</a> for satellite-enabled texting, and has struck up partnerships with airlines to test or offer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/alaska-air-will-offer-starlink-in-flight-internet-starting-next-year-120023852.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">internet connection on flights</a>. Rebranding Project Kuiper to Leo suggests Amazon is finally ready to think about its satellite network as a product in its own right, but the company still has some catching up to do.</p><p>Amazon hasn&#39;t shared a date for when its satellite internet service will be widely available for personal and commercial use, but you can sign-up on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://leo.amazon.com/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Amazon Leo website</a> to receive updates as the company works towards launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html?src=rss]]></description>

But to say money is tight is an understatement this year. If Amazon’s<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.numerator.com/prime-big-deal-days/"> Prime Big Deal Days was any indicator</a>, folks are spending more on essentials than anything else during these big sales.

<p>Even if that’s the case, I’d recommend not overlooking tech entirely this Black Friday. After all, all of us have essential tech that we use every day, and more often than not, you can avoid paying full price for most of those gadgets (and all of the rest of the<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-2025-114500543.html"> best tech of the year</a>) if you&#39;re looking to add to your repertoire or you need a replacement. Personally, I&#39;m not eyeing a new smartphone or laptop this holiday shopping season, but there are a few tech purchases I’d like to make if the prices are right. This is the tech I’m hoping to save on this year during Black Friday.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

In October, the country&#39;s Competition Appeal Tribunal <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-loses-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-over-app-store-fees-184515613.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">determined</a> that Apple benefited from &quot;near absolute market power&quot; over app distribution and in-app payments and was &quot;abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices&quot; as developer commission. At the time, Apple was reportedly planning to appeal, but today, the Tribunal <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/apple-refused-permission-appeal-uk-ruling-app-store-commissions-2025-11-13/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">refused</a> to give the company permission to challenge its decision.&nbsp;</p><p>That means Apple&#39;s next recourse, if it wants to not pony up more than £1 billion in damages, is to take its case directly to the UK Court of Appeal. The company has requested 21 days to file any application with that judicial body.&nbsp;</p><p>It has been a busy year for Apple as it faces more regulatory pressure over its rules for the App Store and fees charged to mobile developers.

From video streaming services to budgeting apps, many services will have some Black Friday promotion you may be able to take advantage of. One of the best we&#39;re tracking is for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1c0b3a26-9b3b-4971-a5c7-65f04653d525&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Audible&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2h6L2F1ZGlibGUvYXJ5YS9tbHA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWMwYjNhMjYtOWIzYi00OTcxLWE1YzctNjVmMDQ2NTNkNTI1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2h6L2F1ZGlibGUvYXJ5YS9tbHAiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUQqCgpFbvc2l0aR-BpzSekE0S8jSztA3KGJbmbkPdew&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/arya/mlp?">Audible</a>. You can sign up and get your first three months for just $3 in total, plus get a $20 Audible credit on top of that.</p> 
<p>This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That&#39;s not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Audible has a diverse catalog that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audible-is-testing-book-recommendations-based-on-your-prime-video-habits-123053133.html">goes beyond audiobooks</a>. It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases. Users also get unlimited access to the Plus Catalog, which houses thousands of audiobooks. Finally, active members get discounts on many audiobooks when looking to purchase.</p> 
<p>Winter is coming and this is a good way to make sure you have plenty to listen to throughout the next three months. This deal does have a time limit. It expires on December 16.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-audible-deal-get-three-months-for-only-3-140010540.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a white elephant gift exchange at work this year or with friends and family, there’s a good chance you’re scrambling right now to find a good gift — or decipher what even makes a good white elephant gift. The possible origins of the term “white elephant” provide one way of looking at it: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>Whether or not that story is true, it gives us one way of looking at a white elephant gift: something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, there are plenty of other ways of interpreting this strange yet delightful tradition. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-white-elephant-faqs">White elephant FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-white-elephant">What is white elephant?</h3> 
<p>A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-does-white-elephant-work">How does white elephant work?</h3> 
<p>A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-it-called-white-elephant">Why is it called white elephant?</h3> 
<p>The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most recent Switch 2 software update looks to have bricked many third-party docks and related accessories, according to users <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/"><ins>across the internet</ins></a> and a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081"><ins>report by </ins><em><ins>Kotaku</ins></em></a>. We don&#39;t know if this was an intentional move by Nintendo or simply an accident. Engadget has reached out to the company for clarification.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 update 21.0.0 brings some much-needed quality-of-life features, like the ability to turn off autoplaying videos in the eShop and new icons that indicate whether a game is digital or physical. However, it also brought along the aforementioned dock hiccup.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Switch 2 owners have reported that these docks either don&#39;t work at all or are now much more finicky, often requiring a restart. This doesn&#39;t seem to have impacted all third-party docks, but complaints are coming in pertaining to many different products. YouTuber AustinJohnPlays tested out two different Switch 2 dock dongles after the update and reported that both were borked.</p>

<p>Why on Earth would Nintendo do this on purpose? The company has been accused of engaging in anti-consumer practices these past several months. Remember, <em>Mario Kart World</em> costs $80, a tutorial minigame collection for the Switch 2 <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/truly-completing-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-cost-you-192255868.html"><ins>starts at $10</ins></a> and a fairly minor <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-is-getting-a-dlc-expansion-today-140016430.html"><ins>DLC update for </ins><em><ins>Donkey Kong Bananza</ins></em><ins> costs $20</ins></a>.</p>
<p>An official dock replacement costs around $80, while many third-party offerings can be found for $30. This could be Nintendo&#39;s way of keeping people tied to their hardware ecosystem. However, it could also just be a mistake and soon we&#39;ll get an update to restore access to these docks. We&#39;ll update this post when we know more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-new-nintendo-switch-2-system-update-just-bricked-many-third-party-docks-194551477.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla may finally be capitulating to the calls of iPhone users wanting what practically every other major automaker offers them, Apple CarPlay. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/tesla-is-working-to-add-apple-carplay-in-bid-to-boost-vehicle-sales"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> is reporting that the EV giant is working to add Apple’s car infotainment integration to its vehicles, according to the outlet’s sources. The feature has reportedly begun internal testing and could be ready for release in the coming months. Of course, development and testing of the feature is not a guarantee that it sees the light of day.</p>
<p>An about-face of this magnitude would be truly surprising given Tesla’s years of steadfast commitment to its own infotainment solution, which doesn’t require connecting a smartphone. In the past, there has been a somewhat frosty relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the iPhone maker. Musk once said that he offered to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-apple-tesla-221149687.html"><ins>sell Tesla to Apple</ins></a> when the Model 3 program almost bankrupted the company, but said Tim Cook refused to take the meeting. Apple had also previously <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-tesla-director-of-autopilot-software-104848566.html"><ins>poached</ins></a> key Tesla employees for its failed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-car-project-is-reportedly-dead-203012885.html"><ins>Apple Car</ins></a> project.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla will reportedly be including CarPlay in a separate window within its existing software interface, ensuring it won’t be fully replacing the existing Tesla system. <em>Bloomberg</em> also reported that Tesla would be using the standard version of CarPlay, as opposed to the newer <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/apples-carplay-ultra-finally-arrives-but-its-exclusive-to-aston-martins-right-now-132516946.html"><ins>CarPlay Ultra</ins></a> that integrates with the vehicle’s instrument cluster.</p>
<p>This would be an interesting time to jump on the bandwagon as Apple CarPlay may be just past its peak. GM recently announced it would be phasing out support for both CarPlay and Android Auto in favor of a system <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html"><ins>built around Gemini</ins></a>, which seems to go directly against the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.autopacific.com/autopacific-insights/2025/7/24/autopacifics-newest-future-attribute-demand-study-fads-shows-increase-in-demand-for-autonomous-driving-and-adas-features"><ins>popularity</ins></a> of the platform. Ford&#39;s CEO recently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/786376/ford-jim-farley-apple-carplay-ultra-decoder"><ins>expressed disappointment</ins></a> in Apple&#39;s latest beefed up version of the tool. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on the report, and at the time of publication Elon Musk has not commented either.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-reportedly-testing-apple-carplay-in-its-vehicles-192505635.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>In iRobot&#39;s lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot&#39;s other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html"><ins>favorite budget robot vacuum</ins></a>, and you&#39;ll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it&#39;s down charging.</p> 
<p>This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results"><ins>its last earning statement</ins></a>. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac&#39;s offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/this-roomba-robot-vacuum-is-on-sale-for-only-150-for-black-friday-191506560.html?src=rss]]></description>

This was discovered by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5jkjanx6k2r">prolific news source and deals curator Wario64</a>, who also revealed a release date of December 4.

<p>That same leaker has also discovered an ESRB website with ratings for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S and the Switch 2. Rockstar&#39;s open world western <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/820086/netflix-red-dead-redemption-mobile-modern-console-update">is heading to current-gen platforms</a> on December 2.

<p>It&#39;s worth reiterating that this is the first <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> from 2010, and not the sequel. It&#39;s still a great game, despite not quite reaching the highs of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>.</p>
<p>This is just the latest team-up between Netflix and Rockstar. <em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-adding-the-gta-trilogy-to-its-games-library-on-december-14-190357966.html">became available on Android and iOS</a> for Netflix subscribers back in 2023.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my many hours playing <em>Vampire Survivors</em> I often wondered what it would feel like to have the absolutely insane bullet hell action extremely close to my eyeballs. Now my dream is being fulfilled, as there&#39;s a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://poncle.games/vr-faq">VR port for Meta Quest headsets</a>.</p>
<p>The appropriately-named <em>Vampire Survivors VR</em> costs $10 and is available for the Meta Quest 2, 3, 3S and Pro. This isn&#39;t a game that puts you in the middle of the action, as you won&#39;t have to duck and weave around the living room to avoid incoming hordes. Rather, it gives you a top-down view of the stage and you use a controller to navigate as you would on any other platform. This kind of tactic has worked in the past with VR titles like <em>Demeo</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="04742896c8774b948637fc04fe7ad0e4"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDAAEYBvq3E?si=khWpdiOhmwS2r8Sx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It can be played seated or standing, which isn&#39;t true of all VR games. Also, this is a standalone version and there&#39;s no cross-buy with other platforms. That means that save files don&#39;t carry over. That&#39;s a bummer, but I guess it makes sense given the uniqueness of VR. Developer Poncle has not revealed if this version will feature online co-op, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vampire-survivors-will-soon-offer-online-co-op-141430146.html">which was recently announced</a> as coming soon to the PC and console builds.</p>
<p>As for DLC, <em>Vampire Survivors VR</em> includes the base game and the <em>Legacy of the Moonspell </em>and <em>Tides of the Foscari</em> expansions. We don&#39;t have any information regarding the status of other expansions like the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vampire-survivors-is-getting-a-castlevania-expansion-but-still-no-vampires-143149407.html">cool Castlevania one</a> or the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-comes-to-vampire-survivors-in-the-form-of-a-free-expansion-183005013.html">utterly bizarre <em>Balatro</em> tie-in</a>.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors VR</em> is available right now, for those willing to risk a massive headache and perhaps a spot of nausea. Poncle currently has no plans to develop it for other VR platforms, like Steam VR or Pico.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/vampire-survivors-vr-asks-what-if-the-bullet-hell-was-on-your-face-190749256.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During Disney&#39;s latest earnings call, CEO Bob Iger spoke about next steps for the Disney+ streaming service, and he noted that the entertainment giant has had &quot;productive conversations&quot; with potential AI partners. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-plus-gen-ai-user-generated-content-1236426135/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, Disney+ might soon play host to user-generated short-form AI videos.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The other thing that we’re really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user generated content — mostly short-form — from others,&quot; Iger said.&nbsp;He didn’t specify which companies Disney has been in talks with or offer any particularly timeline for the arrival of gen-AI features.</p><p>There are already a bunch of ways for people to make and share AI slop videos, so this isn&#39;t a new concept he&#39;s touting. But it is a surprising direction for Disney, which has long been hawkish about protecting both its image and its IP. The company has already made legal moves against multiple different AI platforms, including a cease and desist sent to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Character.AI" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Character.AI</a></a> and copyright infringement lawsuits against <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-and-universal-studios-file-suit-against-midjourney-for-copyright-infringement-154206053.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Midjourney</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-warner-bros-discovery-and-universal-file-joint-lawsuit-against-generative-ai-app-hailuo-163819825.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Hailuo</a>. Iger said he hoped any partnership would &quot;reflect our need to protect the IP,&quot; and it would almost certainly be a lucrative deal for Disney. But even within the confines of its own platform, this is still quite an about-face for the company to now encourage gen-AI creations of familiar characters.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-may-start-hosting-user-generated-ai-videos-185000745.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been clear for some time that all is not well at Ubisoft. Between games not meeting the company&#39;s sales expectations, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">studio closures</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-laying-off-more-workers-and-offering-voluntary-buyouts-120030931.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">downsizing elsewhere</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/former-ubisoft-executives-convicted-in-france-184919411.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">sexual misconduct issues</a>, it&#39;s been a rocky past several years for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>But now it seems something else may be going on at the publisher. Just before it was set to hold a call with investors on Thursday, Ubisoft said it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/13/3187667/0/en/Postponement-of-H1-FY2025-26-results-announcement.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">delaying</a> its half-year earnings report and halting trading of its shares. It has asked Euronext — the European stock market on which its shares are listed — to halt trading from November 14 until it publishes its earnings results &quot;in the coming days.&quot;</p><p>This could mean any number of things. Other companies have delayed earnings reports due to things like <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-finally-offers-233122126.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">accounting issues</a>. But halting trading of the company&#39;s shares could portend major news, such as a sale or Ubisoft becoming a private entity again. Engadget has contacted Ubisoft for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>It was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">reported late last year</a> that the founders of Ubisoft were looking to take the company private with the help of Tencent. That hasn&#39;t transpired as yet, but Ubisoft (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-spins-out-subsidiary-with-a-billion-dollar-investment-from-tencent-183516992.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">with the help of a Tencent investment</a>) did this year form a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios.

The idea is similar to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-rolling-out-its-telegram-like-broadcast-channels-worldwide-160815133.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">broadcast channels</a> on Instagram or Telegram&#39;s one-way messaging feature.&nbsp;</p><p>People who opt to join a creator&#39;s bulletin board will receive updates in their TikTok inbox. Updates can include text, links, polls or photos; as well as other TikTok posts or lives. Followers who join a board can react to messages but won&#39;t be able to comment or reply like a typical DM or post. According to TikTok, the feature could be especially useful for musicians and artists, as it allows them to share new songs and give fans a way to &quot;pre-save&quot; an upcoming release.</p><p>For creators with a large following, having a bulletin board could help streamline their ability to interact with fans without having to wade through an overloaded inbox or post separate video updates. It also gives them a way to get their work (including links to non-TikTok content) in front of their biggest fans without relying on the whims of the app&#39;s recommendation algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bulletin Board is available now to all creators over the age of 18 with 50,000 or more followers. TikTok users can find and join bulletin boards on creators&#39; profiles.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktoks-new-bulletin-board-feature-lets-creators-send-updates-to-their-fans-inboxes-181000448.html?src=rss]]></description>

The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there&#39;s an option to say if you&#39;re expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn&#39;t offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it&#39;s not for you.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/quicken-simplifi-subscriptions-are-half-off-for-black-friday-160025840.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lego is cutting prices for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. I&#39;m a lifelong Lego lover, and my younger self would have squealed at some of the deals I&#39;m seeing — as I&#39;m betting is true for many of you. With so many to choose from, you&#39;ll be able to find one that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-tech-gifts-and-gadgets-for-2025-140052015.html">makes a great gift</a> for anyone who you know loves these little building bricks.</p> 
<p>Throughout the month, I&#39;ll be checking all the biggest online shopping centers in search of the biggest discounts on the best Lego sets available. We&#39;ve already seen low prices on Disney and Harry Potter advent calendars your kids will love this December, plus beautiful botanicals and art pieces for yourself or the adults on your list. It&#39;s only likely to get better, so keep checking regularly.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>In general, we always recommend using a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">price tracker</a> when determining if a Lego deal is in fact a good one. You&#39;ll find Lego deals across the board this holiday season at retailers like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=04961d2b-11c7-46ee-ad98-02c58e5cd3ae&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3M_az1sZWdvJnJoPXBfbl9kZWFsX3R5cGUlM0EyMzU2NjA2NTAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNDk2MWQyYi0xMWM3LTQ2ZWUtYWQ5OC0wMmM1OGU1Y2QzYWUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vcz9rPWxlZ28mcmg9cF9uX2RlYWxfdHlwZSUzQTIzNTY2MDY1MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWuKMcAAurSWO8qBXo-P0E9v-yEHTM1oQ3zEQIkMkADP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dlego%26rh%3Dp_n_deal_type%253A23566065011" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=lego&amp;rh=p_n_deal_type%3A23566065011&amp;dc&amp;crid=1Z0T9GEPNLL3V&amp;qid=1762450815&amp;rnid=23566063011&amp;sprefix=lego+star+wars%2Caps%2C208&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_n_deal_type_1&amp;ds=v1%3AhlrF700NSndy7MpykhHSTqorRRYfcMBKyRoYYv4pOvY">Amazon</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=04961d2b-11c7-46ee-ad98-02c58e5cd3ae&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9icmFuZC9sZWdvLzEwMDMwMDk2P3BvdmlkPUVUU19EMDdfVlNCX0J1aWxkaW5nU2V0c19WRl9CUk5EX1NSQ0gtTEVHT1NlYXJjaF9MRUdPQnJhbmRTaG9wIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNDk2MWQyYi0xMWM3LTQ2ZWUtYWQ5OC0wMmM1OGU1Y2QzYWUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL2JyYW5kL2xlZ28vMTAwMzAwOTY_cG92aWQ9RVRTX0QwN19WU0JfQnVpbGRpbmdTZXRzX1ZGX0JSTkRfU1JDSC1MRUdPU2VhcmNoX0xFR09CcmFuZFNob3AifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdwPsGweZwvDenAHQHxCAQWT1upABTu39LrKo37hXqan&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrand%2Flego%2F10030096%3Fpovid%3DETS_D07_VSB_BuildingSets_VF_BRND_SRCH-LEGOSearch_LEGOBrandShop" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.walmart.com/brand/lego/10030096?povid=ETS_D07_VSB_BuildingSets_VF_BRND_SRCH-LEGOSearch_LEGOBrandShop">Walmart</a>, but don&#39;t overlook <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=04961d2b-11c7-46ee-ad98-02c58e5cd3ae&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Lego%27s+own+site&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9jYXRlZ29yaWVzL3NhbGVzLWFuZC1kZWFscyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDQ5NjFkMmItMTFjNy00NmVlLWFkOTgtMDJjNThlNWNkM2FlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9jYXRlZ29yaWVzL3NhbGVzLWFuZC1kZWFscyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaU4kmNkt-R-vq0q8OYFvVhNpzh7oDicxOUmH1u3S51i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fcategories%2Fsales-and-deals" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/categories/sales-and-deals">Lego&#39;s own site</a>.

<p>If you&#39;re a YouTube TV subscriber who relies on ESPN for football games, or maybe you never miss an episode of <em>Dancing with the Stars</em> (which airs on ABC), you&#39;re probably getting frustrated with the ongoing Disney feud. The two channels, along with other Disney-owned channels like Freeform and FX, have been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html">off air since October 30</a>, which is just over two weeks.</p>
<p>While no resolution has been reached yet, the two large streaming companies are still negotiating the new pricing terms. One analyst has estimated that Disney is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-cfo-on-outube-tv-carriage-battle-1236616203/">losing upwards of $4 million per day</a> while the holdout continues. &quot;We’re ready to go as long as they want to,” <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-cfo-on-outube-tv-carriage-battle-1236616203/">said Disney&#39;s CFO Hugh Johnston on CNBC</a> while discussing the company&#39;s quarterly earnings. Disney, of course, is trying to maximize the fees it gets for its channels, while <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/">YouTube claims Disney is &quot;proposing costly economic terms,&quot;</a> which could result in higher subscription prices.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But there&#39;s good news: YouTube has made good on its promise to offer a $20 credit to subscribers — you should&#39;ve received an email from YouTube about it. However, it&#39;s not automatic so you&#39;ll need to claim it first — here&#39;s how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-your-20-credit-from-youtube-tv">How to get your $20 credit from YouTube TV</h2>
<p>YouTube TV already <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">costs you at least $83 a month</a>, so take advantage of the $20 credit while you can. Here&#39;s what you need to do.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open YouTube TV in a web browser and go to your Membership Settings in the upper-right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the bottom of the menu and click Updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Click &quot;Claim credit&quot; on the Updates screen.</p></li>
<li><p>You should see a confirmation screen showing you&#39;ve claimed the credit. It will be applied to your next bill, likely in December.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pause-or-cancel-youtube-tv">How to pause or cancel YouTube TV</h2>
<p>If the two can&#39;t reach an agreement, you may be looking to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129668">cancel your YouTube TV subscription</a> (or at least pause it until there&#39;s a resolution). Here&#39;s how to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open YouTube TV in a web browser and go to your Membership Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Membership.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Manage.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Cancel Membership, and then click Cancel to confirm.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the same settings, you can also pause your subscription until YouTube cuts a deal with Disney. Go to Settings &gt; Membership &gt; select the number of weeks you want to pause your subscription, and then click Pause.</p>
<p>That&#39;ll at least give you more time to decide whether it&#39;s worth keeping your account or closing it out.</p>

<p>Your $20 credit just goes to your next YouTube TV bill. But if you view that as &quot;$20 more to spend on streaming this month,&quot; you can put that budget towards some fairly straightforward workarounds, including ESPN&#39;s new standalone service, Fubo (a YouTube TV competitor) and several more.

<p>Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">one of the strongest in the category</a>. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we&#39;ve tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you&#39;ll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture.

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-drone">What to look for in a drone</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-camera-features">Camera features</h3> 
<p>For this guide, we&#39;re looking only at drones that are basically flying cameras, so you want the best video and photo features possible. Bigger devices like DJI’s Mavic 3 Pro or Air 3S carry relatively large sensors, offering superior camera quality for nighttime cityscapes or other low-light scenes. Smaller models like the Mini 4 Pro and HoverAir X1 Max use smaller camera sensors, so they aren’t as good in dim light.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Field of view and minimum aperture are also important, with most drones typically having a wide-angle focal length, though a few others like the HoverAir X1 Max carry an ultrawide lens. Some models have multiple cameras including a wide and a zoom. As for aperture, lower numbers are better and allow for shooting in dim light. Most DJI models are solid in this regard, while the HoverAir models don’t perform as well.</p> 
<p>Video resolution and slow-mo are also essential camera capabilities. Most drones these days can shoot at 4K with a frame rate of at least 30 fps, though some offer 6K or even 8K at up to 30 fps. Higher-end models can shoot 4K at up to 120 fps, allowing you to slow down the action dramatically to create a cinematic look.</p> 
<p>Other noteworthy features include log or HDR video that supports higher dynamic range, particularly in bright and sunny conditions. Finally, the camera’s gimbal and stabilization are important factors to keep your footage looking as smooth as possible. Some drones have gimbals that can rotate the camera 90 degrees to give social media creators the maximum resolution for vertical formats.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-drone-features-speed-range-safety-battery-life-and-obstacle-detection">Drone features: Speed, range, safety, battery life and obstacle detection</h3> 
<p>By and large, there are two types of camera drones to consider. The first are standard drones (usually with open propellers but not always) designed to fly outside and take scenic shots. Often there’s nothing to stop the props from striking skin or objects, so they can’t really be used indoors or around people. Some models like the DJI Neo and Flip have prop guards that better protect bystanders and property, as well as the drone itself.</p> 
<p>Then there&#39;s first-person-view (FPV) camera drones, which often have propeller guards and are meant to be used both indoors or outside to capture exciting footage. Standard models don’t need to go particularly fast as they’re mainly used to shoot fun videos for social media, but FPV drones need to move at high speeds to create excitement. Because of that speed, they’re also better in breezy conditions thanks to stronger wind resistance, and they can fight gusts and return home more quickly. Acrobatic abilities (often promoted by the manufacturer in ads or packaging) are also important for FPV drones, as it allows the user to perform tricks and zip around obstacles.</p> 
<p>Battery life is another important factor. The best drones boast a battery endurance of up to 45 minutes, while FPV drones like the Avata 2 can only fly for about half that time as they tend to be heavier and carry smaller batteries to reduce weight. As a general rule, a single battery isn’t enough for any serious shooting so you’d do well to buy your drone in a kit with a few batteries and a charger.</p> 
<p>As for range, DJI tends to dominate in this area, with its latest models able to maintain a video signal at a distance up to 20km (12.4 miles). HoverAir’s models are weaker with the top-end X1 Max model limited to just 1km (0.6 miles) when using the optional beacon system. DJI also offers multiple ways to control its drones including headsets, joystick-type controllers, motion detection controllers and smartphones.</p> 
<p>The best drones have sensors to detect obstacles in all directions. Others are limited to only avoiding obstructions coming at them from the front and some only rely on the main camera to prevent crashes. Finally, if you want to have your drone follow you around automatically, you’ll need it to be able to track you around when you’re vlogging, riding a bike or skiing, while also avoiding obstacles. Smooth takeoff and return-to-home features are especially valuable here for both beginners and experienced drone pilots as well.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-rules-for-owning-a-drone">What are the rules for owning a drone?</h3> 
<p>Anyone can buy any drone, but once purchased, all drones between 250g and 25 kg must be registered with the FAA and marked with the FAA registration number. Recreational pilots with drones over 249g must pass the recreational UAS safety &quot;TRUST&quot; exam and carry proof of TRUST completion when flying a drone. Commercial pilots must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA. You must be aware of and avoid any areas with airspace restrictions, particularly around airports.</p>

<p>In general, it is not legal to fly a drone within city limits over populations, as a crash from a high altitude could injure or kill someone. However, they can be flown over adjacent, non-populated areas in many cases.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Yesterday, Valve announced three (3) hardware products: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a Steam Machine console</a>, an accompanying Steam Controller and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">long-rumored Steam Frame VR headset</a>. This hardware, along with the excellent Steam Deck, gives Valve a pretty comprehensive way to get people playing games wherever they want, on any sort of screen. And, of course, the games are what this is all about. Steam’s catalog is impossibly vast, encompassing every genre you can imagine — but there’s still one crucial title missing from the thousands of games available.</p><p>I am, of course, talking about <em>Half-Life 3.</em></p><p>I swore back in 2017 that I’d <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-10-half-life-2-episode-two-10-years-later.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">stop beating this dead horse</a>, but Valve <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-22-half-life-alyx-roller-coaster-of-emotions.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">sucked me back</a> in with the utterly unexpected, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">excellent</a>, VR-only <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>prequel. At the very least, it was a sign that the Half-Life universe <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-half-life-alyx-valve-vr-prequel.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">wasn’t dead and buried</a> in Valve’s mind, despite the fact that it had lain dormant with an unresolved cliffhanger for more than a dozen years.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2W0N3uKXmo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>At the time, Valve indicated it was interested in moving forward with more games in the series, though I wouldn’t have been surprised if the company just dropped things again. But, a big push into hardware that is significantly more powerful than the Steam Deck feels like <em>another</em> perfect opportunity to make Half<em>-Life 3</em> happen.</p><p>And there have actually been a few more concrete bread crumbs to follow over the last year or so indicating Valve might finally be returning to the Half-Life story. It <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-celebrates-half-life-2s-20th-anniversary-with-a-big-update-174316547.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">started with the 20th anniversary of <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>, when Valve dropped a major update for the game. “Every map in Half-Life 2 has been looked over by Valve level designers to fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog,” the developer wrote. Along with some developer commentary, a documentary and the inclusion of the two episodic follow-up games, this was a pretty substantial update for such an old game.</p><p>At the end of last year, YouTuber Gabe Follower dropped some details on a potential <em>Half-Life 3</em> coming soon. Follower had previously called the release of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, lending some credibility to his findings. To make a long story short, Follower claimed a Valve project internally titled “HLX” had reached the play-testing stage. That didn’t necessarily mean a launch was imminent, but at the very least the game was advancing in development.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g98eQx6WvbI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Another less consequential but fun tidbit dropped around the same time: actor Michael Shapiro (who voiced the infamous G-Man in the Half-Life series) posted a New Years’ message where he spoke in the G-Man’s strange accent and said he’d see viewers in the year to come. Not coincidentally, he also did this in 2020 prior to the <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> launch. The game had already been announced when he posted that message, but it’s still an intriguing tease.&nbsp;</p><p>The timing couldn’t be better, either. The Game Awards are less than a month away, and that extravaganza is about the biggest platform you could ask for if you’re announcing a big new title. Not that Valve really needs the stage — they could just drop a trailer on YouTube and the gaming world would take care of the rest.</p><p>But as a companion piece to the company’s renewed hardware ambitions? The synergy would be too good to pass up. After all, the Valve Index VR headset launched just a short time before <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>was announced, and anyone who had purchased it got the game for free. A theoretical <em>Half-Life 3</em> isn’t quite the same, as there’s no chance the game will require the official Steam Machine. But it would still make a heck of a launch title to help drive interest in the company’s new devices.&nbsp;</p><p>As for me, I’m not letting myself get too excited here. I remember in 2013, when Valve introduced the first Steam Machines initiative and its first attempt at a controller, I assumed it would be a perfect time to announce <em>Half-Life 3</em>. That clearly did not happen. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit hopeful this time around. There’s enough smoke to make me think that the fire is real; it’s hopefully time to wake up and smell the ashes.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html?src=rss]]></description>

Now, nearly a full year later, the company is bringing that same capability to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/notebooklm-the-acceptable-face-of-google-ai-is-getting-an-app-in-may-182041294.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">NotebookLM</a>. Like its Gemini counterpart, the tool allows you to task the app with generating an extensive report on a single topic. When you queue a Deep Research task, NotebookLM will browse hundreds of websites on your behalf before it starts writing up its findings.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire process can take a few minutes, but at the end you&#39;ll have a multi-page report to read. As the model works in the background, you can instruct it to seek out specific online sources. NotebookLM will also recommend articles, papers and websites that might be relevant to your query. Once its findings are ready, you can use any of NotebookLM&#39;s capabilities to generate insights on the content.</p><p>With today&#39;s update, Google is also adding to the variety of sources NotebookLM can access. Now the app can pull data from Google Sheets, Microsoft Word documents and PDFs you&#39;ve uploaded to Google Drive. It&#39;s now also possible to add Google Drive files just by copying over the URL.&nbsp;Google says all of today&#39;s enhancements should roll out to users within a week. The timing of the update is fortuitous given the company recently gave NotebookLM the capability to generate <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/notebooklm-can-now-test-your-knowledge-with-flashcards-and-quizzes-183351007.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">flashcards and quizzes</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-deep-research-capabilities-to-notebooklm-170000817.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is revamping Facebook Marketplace in an effort to make it more appealing to &quot;young adults&quot; on the platform. The updates includes new collaborative shopping features, as well as AI-generated suggestions and &quot;insights&quot; about specific listings.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, would-be buyers can create Pinterest-like &quot;collections&quot; of Marketplace listings and invite friends to join. These collections can then be shared elsewhere on Facebook or on WhatsApp and Messenger. People will also be able to invite their Facebook friends to join messages with sellers, which Meta says will make it &quot;easier to coordinate pickup, negotiate prices, and get answers to your questions.&quot; Facebook is also making Marketplace listings themselves more social, with the ability to add comments and reactions. And while I&#39;m not sure many Facebook users are clamoring for this, it seems like it could seriously up the meme potential for accounts like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@insanefbmarketplace" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">@insanefbmarketplace</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-12_at_16.39.34.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-12_at_16.39.34.png" style="height:343px;width:851px;" alt="Meta will provide AI-generated insights about vehicles listed on Marketplace." data-uuid="b26ce8b8-f93b-4236-a41a-0d262708d763"><figcaption>Meta will provide AI-generated insights about vehicles listed on Marketplace.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>And, because it&#39;s 2025 and AI is in just about every other part of Facebook, the company is also adding &quot;AI insights&quot; to listings. This will allow Meta AI to offer up suggestions for questions to ask sellers about the items they&#39;ve listed. (Importantly, though, it looks like the default first-message suggestion is still a variation of &quot;is this still available,&quot; which I&#39;ve always found to be one of the more annoying quirks of using Marketplace.) The company is also experimenting with vehicle-specific &quot;insights&quot; from Meta AI as car shopping is apparently one of the most popular use cases for Marketplace among younger adults.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the updates are part of Meta&#39;s years-long <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-says-the-future-of-facebook-is-young-adults-again-203500866.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">mission</a> to make Facebook cool — or, at least, useful — for &quot;young adults.&quot; And the company has long touted Marketplace as one of the more popular features among that demographic. The company has also experimented with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-is-pushing-local-content-and-events-to-try-to-win-back-young-adults-161742961.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">local events</a>, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-decides-content-from-your-actual-friends-is-an-og-facebook-feature-180803853.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">friends-only</a> feed and bringing back the Facebook &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/21-years-later-meta-still-hasnt-given-up-on-the-facebook-poke-000446458.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">poke</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-trying-to-make-facebook-marketplace-a-social-shopping-experience-170000682.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-have-arrived-the-best-tech-sales-from-amazon-apple-lego-anker-and-others-so-far-100052657.html?src=rss]]></description>

But if you really want to make the Steam Machine feel extra special when it arrives in early 2026, you’re going to want to dress it up in Dbrand’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:dbrand;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b4b2716f-3984-4476-b619-18c9cba6b899&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e89e229e-6ac5-44b7-bf87-912595728217&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=dbrand&amp;linkText=Companion+Cube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RicmFuZC5jb20vc2hvcC9saW1pdGVkLWVkaXRpb24vY29tcGFuaW9uLWN1YmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU4OWUyMjllLTZhYzUtNDRiNy1iZjg3LTkxMjU5NTcyODIxNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kYnJhbmQuY29tL3Nob3AvbGltaXRlZC1lZGl0aW9uL2NvbXBhbmlvbi1jdWJlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdBcEqz8ZXe9DwL2acxMDF91YyernEFIIlcN2rPOpEYT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Flimited-edition%2Fcompanion-cube" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/companion-cube">Companion Cube</a> skin.</p>
<p>A tribute to the iconic Weighted Companion Cube from Valve’s beloved Portal series, it’s such a fitting design that I sort of wonder if the company is kicking itself for not making something similar for its cube-shaped compact PC. Of course, putting your Steam Machine inside this will ensure it stands out from the other consoles occupying your TV unit, which is the opposite effect that the standard design is going to have. While it does have a customizable front plate and an LED light strip, the default all-black colorway could hardly be less attention-grabbing.</p>
<p>In case you missed yesterday&#39;s announcement, the Steam Machine is a Linux-based mini PC that runs SteamOS and is designed to be plugged into your TV, like a console. Valve says it’s roughly six times more powerful than a Steam Deck and is capable of supporting 4K/60fps gaming with FSR. You can also use it to stream VR games to the new <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html">Stream Frame</a> headset, while the Steam Controller, with its distinctive trackpads, allows you to play your Steam games wirelessly.</p>
<p>Given that we don’t yet have a release date or price for the Steam Machine, Dbrand’s accessory doesn&#39;t have either of those yet either, but it is coming in 2026. And I’m fairly confident that isn’t a lie…</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/dbrands-companion-cube-is-the-perfect-partner-for-your-future-steam-machine-161634417.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are about a month away from the premiere of <em>Fallout</em> season two on Prime Video. The streaming gods have blessed us with a beefy two-minute trailer that&#39;s packed with &quot;blink and you&#39;ll miss it&quot; Easter eggs and nods to the source material.</p>
<p>This is the first real-deal trailer for the upcoming season, though we did get a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-two-has-a-teaser-trailer-and-a-december-17-release-date-211307692.html"><ins>teaser back in August</ins></a>. It checks in on every major character from the first season and, of course, is absolutely littered with New Vegas stuff. The first batch of episodes ended with an acknowledgment that the show <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/first-images-from-fallout-season-2-tease-new-vegas-182528357.html"><ins>would be visiting the iconic location</ins></a> and this trailer further proves that.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7de1b8e43fde461eb88d506df85ab9b6"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECI3eCAxRGw?si=x_rVP7d_a4sGRKPI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>There are new actors coming to the show, many of which are featured here. Justin Theroux is playing Mr. House, a fan favorite character from the games who was originally voiced by the late, great René Auberjonois. Kumail Nanjiani shows up, and so does Macaulay Culkin. Ron Perlman can also be heard speaking during the trailer, and he did all of the opening narrations for the Fallout games.</p>
<p>We have no idea what will happen this season, as the show is set in the Fallout universe but is telling its own story. The first season took the world by storm, given that nobody really <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-fallout-tv-series-is-a-very-awesome-tv-show-130039789.html"><ins>expected it to be quite that good</ins></a>. The new batch of episodes begin on December 17, but this is a weekly release schedule. There will be no Netflix-style drop here.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallouts-new-season-two-trailer-is-filled-with-quick-nods-to-the-source-material-161533128.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers </em>is not coming to PS5, at least not initially. It&#39;s a mobile-first game that&#39;s also coming to PC, in another example of Sony Interactive Entertainment expanding <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-made-an-official-240hz-playstation-monitor-with-a-built-in-dualsense-charging-hook-230659339.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">beyond its core PlayStation console business</a>.</p><p>NCSoft, the MMO developer and publisher behind the likes of the Guild Wars series and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-throne-and-liberty-mmo-is-coming-to-the-west-in-september-123028015.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Throne and Liberty</em></a>, is taking the lead on <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>. It&#39;s working on the game alongside original Horizon developer Guerrilla Games and Sony.</p><p><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers </em>is said to build on the fun robot dinosaur hunting action of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> with greater player freedom, &quot;deeply customizable combat&quot; and other advanced MMORPG systems. You&#39;ll be able to undertake &quot;large-scale raids&quot; with other players. You&#39;ll likely end up competing with other players for resources too.</p><p>You&#39;ll create your own character, who belongs to a tribe of your choosing. Just like in the main games, status effects are a key component of combat. You&#39;ll also be able to grapple onto giant machines, chip parts of them off and use weapons that robot enemies drop against them. In a neat touch, you can carry these weapons on your mount and use them in your next fight. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> has Tallnecks too, so I&#39;m happy about that.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The action is set in a region called the Deadlands, which is inspired by New Mexico and Arizona, and you&#39;ll share this part of the Horizon world with &quot;thousands of other players,&quot; according to Guerrilla studio director Jan-Bart Van Beek. As with the series&#39; core games, the story here concerns finding a balance between humanity, technology and nature.</p><p>Guerrilla <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-multiplayer-single-player-guerrilla-games-155004343.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">said back in 2022</a> that it was working on more “epic solo adventures for Aloy” (the protagonist of the mainline entries) and it&#39;s said to be making its own Horizon multiplayer game. This MMO isn&#39;t the first Horizon spin-off either. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-horizon-adventures-might-be-sonys-most-important-game-of-the-year-160026354.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a>, from Guerilla Games and Studio Gobo, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-horizon-adventures-hits-ps5-pc-and-switch-on-november-14-223756234.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">arrived a year ago</a>. Co-op is a key aspect of that game, so that&#39;s a multiplayer title too.</p><p>Handing development of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers </em>to a studio with vast experience in the MMO genre is a smart move on Sony&#39;s part. The company pivoted a few years back to focus heavily on live-service games, but that strategy hasn&#39;t panned out so well. Sure, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-on-august-26-172937757.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a><em> </em>has been a major hit, but <em>Concord</em> was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-concord-and-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-180321212.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">an utter disaster</a>. An attempt to make a multiplayer game in the world of The Last of Us <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/naughty-dog-cancels-development-on-the-last-of-us-online-055333989.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">didn&#39;t work out</a>. Sony&#39;s acquisition of Bungie hasn&#39;t gone as smoothly as expected either. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-says-destiny-2-has-not-met-expectations-200000610.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">said this week</a> it wrote down the value of Bungie&#39;s assets by $204 million amid <em>Destiny 2</em>&#39;s struggles, putting even more pressure on the upcoming <em>Marathon</em> to succeed.</p><p>Sony and NCSoft have not yet revealed a release date for <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers. </em>In any case, Horizon is one of Sony&#39;s most popular franchises and it should make for strong fodder for an MMO. The action in the gameplay trailer looks as slick as you&#39;d expect from this series and taking down robot dinos with friends in Monster Hunter-style action could be a lot of fun. It&#39;s probably a good thing that you&#39;re not playing as Aloy here, given how annoyingly reluctant she is to accept help from would-be allies in her own games.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-latest-horizon-spin-off-is-an-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile-but-not-ps5-153532860.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, Valve announced a load of new hardware this week, including a second stab at the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html"><ins>Steam Machine</ins></a>, a Steam controller, and a long-rumored new VR headset called the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html"><ins>Steam Frame</ins></a>. But in with the new often means out with the old, and perhaps inevitably, the company has confirmed that its previous headset, the Valve Index, is no more.</p>
<p>Valve’s Lawrence Yang told <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817967/valve-index-vr-headset-stopped-manufacturing-frame"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that it’s &quot;no longer manufacturing&quot; the Index, which we <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-07-valve-index-hands-on-vr.html"><ins>called</ins></a> &quot;the best desktop VR yet&quot; when it launched in 2019. The Index arrived around the same time as the Oculus Quest and its promise of an affordable all-in-one future for VR. By contrast, the Valve Index was very much still a high-end tethered device for the hardcore enthusiasts, with a price tag that reflected that.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We don’t know how much the Steam Frame will cost yet, but it definitely sounds like Valve is making a play for the more casual VR crowd here too, as well as those who want to play demanding 3D titles. You can stream flatscreen and VR games from your PC or Steam Machine using a wireless adapter, but the Steam Frame is also a standalone device like the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html"><ins>Meta Quest 3</ins></a>, backed by a built-in Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and 16GB of RAM. Valve is supporting Android games too, seemingly a move to entice VR developers to bring their Quest games over to Steam.</p>
<p>In order to track your movements in virtual space, the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html"><ins>Valve Index</ins></a> relied on external lighthouse base stations, which meant you had to go through a more than a little laborious setup process to play roomscale VR games. Consumer VR has moved towards built-in sensors since then, and it sounds like Valve wants to leave its lighthouses in the past too, with the company confirming to <em>The Verge </em>that they won’t be supported on the Steam Frame. The new headset instead has four high-res monochrome cameras for inside-out tracking, as well as infrared LEDs on the outside that help with tracking in darker environments.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valve-confirms-that-it-has-stopped-making-the-index-vr-headset-150324456.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This particular model easily made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

<p>We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark.</p> 
<p>The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn&#39;t just for Nintendo&#39;s latest console. It&#39;ll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.

It’s supposed to mark the availability of the phone outside of China, where it came out in October, but the US government shutdown apparently put a damper on the manufacturer’s plans. “As is the case with every smartphone manufacturer, the United States’ Federal Communications Commission certifies OnePlus devices before they are sold in the US,” said Spenser Blank, OnePlus North America’s Head of Marketing &amp; Communications, in a statement. “As a result of the government shutdown, device certifications have been delayed.” That means the US release of the model has been postponed until the FCC approves its certifications.</p><p>The company explained that the OnePlus 15 has already gone through all the required tests from labs recognized by the government agency. It is also done submitting formal application for the certifications, and it’s just a matter of waiting for approvals at this point. “We are hopeful that approvals can be generated quickly and as a result, we can bring the OnePlus 15 to our customers in the US expeditiously,” Blank said. </p><p>OnePlus 15 is the first phone to ship with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/oxygenos-16-has-new-lock-screen-customization-options-and-a-novel-gemini-integration-184958404.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OxygenOS 16</a>, the company’s take on Android 16.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re reading this review, there’s a chance you’ve come to it with some confusion. Didn’t OnePlus already release a new flagship phone this year, and wasn’t it called the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html" data-i13n="slk:OnePlus 13;cpos:1;pos:1">OnePlus 13</a>? The answer is yes to both those questions. So, what gives? Well, over the last few years, OnePlus has been working to shorten the gap between when its phones debut in China and when they’re available in the rest of the world. This year, the OnePlus 15 arrives in North America just a few short weeks after its initial October 27 release. And like it did with the jump between the OP3 and OP5, OnePlus is skipping the OP14 because of the number four and its unlucky association in Chinese culture.</p><p>With that cleared up, you might think the OnePlus 15 suffers from following too soon after its predecessor. I’m happy to report it offers some clear upgrades over the OP13, including a faster processor and an absurdly big battery. What it doesn’t do, however, is change the OnePlus formula — for better and worse.</p><p><core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="fb8e9cce-1df6-4d7a-a6e4-0471ee1dc862" data-original-url="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-15"></core-commerce></p><h2 id="304b36d8-078d-4e05-a46c-29641be2a7c1">Pricing and availability</h2><p>Due to the federal government shutdown, the OnePlus 15 does not have a US release date yet. The company had hoped to begin selling the phone starting today, November 13, but the phone has yet to obtain the necessary clearance.&nbsp;</p><p>"As is the case with every smartphone manufacturer, the United States’ Federal Communications Commission certifies OnePlus devices before they are sold in the US. As a result of the government shutdown, device certifications have been delayed," Spenser Blank, OnePlus North America’s head of marketing and communications, told Engadget.</p><p>"Subsequently, US sales for the OnePlus 15 will be postponed until they have been secured. The OnePlus 15 has already finished all the required tests from the FCC’s recognized labs and the certification application has been formally submitted. We are hopeful that approvals can be generated quickly and as a result, we can bring the OnePlus 15 to our customers in the U.S. expeditiously."&nbsp;</p><p>There's also some uncertainty around pricing. On release, OnePlus plans to offer two versions of the OnePlus 15. The base model, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, will cost $900. The company will also sell a 16GB/512GB variant that will cost $1,000. However, OnePlus warns the price of both models is "subject to change due to current market conditions."</p><h2 id="3f967932-e697-48db-8b21-9b9734fce67b"><strong>Hardware and display</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-2.jpg" style="height:3375px;width:6000px;" alt="The OnePlus 15 offers a big, vibrant AMOLED display.

There’s no two ways about it, in making its new flagship look more like those devices, OnePlus has at the same time made it look more like last year’s iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>It’s a shame. The design of the OnePlus 13 was one of the things my co-worker Sam Rutherford <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html" data-i13n="slk:praised that phone for;cpos:3;pos:1">praised that phone for</a>, and it’s something I liked about it too. The 15 just looks generic, even if there are a few nice touches. For example, the sand storm color has a nice, ceramic-like feel to it. One other impressive aspect of the design is how thin OnePlus has managed to keep the 15 while adding a massive 7,300mAh battery. At 0.31 inches thick, the sand storm variant is only slightly fatter than the 0.29-inch thick <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html" data-i13n="slk:Galaxy S25 FE;cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy S25 FE</a> I recently reviewed, which has a more modest 4,900mAh battery (the two other OP15 colorways, infinite black and ultra violet, are listed as slightly thicker at 0.32 inches).</p><p>Now, if you’re a longtime OnePlus fan, I need to mention the 15 doesn’t have the signature Alert Slider found on the company’s previous phones. I know what you’re thinking, did OnePlus do away with a fan favorite feature to add an AI button? The answer is both yes and no. The first time you tap the Plus Key, OxygenOS will prompt you to make it a shortcut for one of eight functions. Naturally, the default option is to use the button in conjunction with the company’s newish Mind Space AI hub, but you also can bind other functions to the Plus Key, including the old Alert Slider functionality. Even if it’s another thing that’s derivative of the iPhone, I like the flexibility the Plus Key gives.</p><p>Separately, OnePlus has gone with a different screen this time around. The OP15 offers a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 1,272 x 2,772 resolution. The new screen is both smaller and less dense than the one found on the OnePlus 13, which was 6.82 inches big and had a 1,440 x 3,168 resolution. It’s also faster, offering a 165Hz refresh rate in select games, up from 120Hz on the earlier model. OnePlus told me it went with the lower resolution display because there’s no OLED manufacturer making QHD panels that fast yet. I’ll have more to say about the display in the performance section, but for now I’ll say the OP15’s screen is one of the best parts of using the phone. It’s dense enough to make text and images look sharp, and with up to 1,800 nits of brightness available, it’s easy to see and use even in harsh sunlight.</p><h2 id="f1e68af6-bdd5-44ce-8d37-ae417436e334"><strong>Cameras</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-1.jpg" style="height:3375px;width:6000px;" alt="The OnePlus 15's cameras are a half step behind the competition.

I’ll get to the software in a moment. First, OnePlus has once again gone with a main camera system built around three 50-megapixel sensors. What’s different this time around are the lenses. Two of them are slightly slower than their counterparts on the OnePlus 13. The main camera now has an f/1.8 aperture lens, down from the f/1.6 glass found on last year’s model. At the same time, OnePlus has gone with an f/2.8 lens for the telephoto camera. For comparison, the OP13 had an f/2.6 lens for distant shots. The good news is both cameras still come with optical image stabilization (OIS).</p><p>Broadly, the OP15 suffers from the same problem its predecessor did. Most photos look good — sometimes great even — but they don’t come out as nice as what you might snap with the latest phones from Apple, Google or Samsung. The difference is most noticeable in nighttime and low-light photos where the OP15 can sometimes struggle to eke out shadow detail. It will also completely miss a shot because it used too slow of a shutter speed. I sometimes saw similar results in daytime photos in situations where the company’s high dynamic range algorithm would get tripped up by harsh lighting. Specifically, the shots had overly lifted shadows and unnatural highlights, resulting in photos that look flat with poor contrast.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c321e4a1-416d-46b1-9bab-05fcf13e8b8f" /><p>I also wish the OP15 had a better telephoto camera. It’s not bad by any means, but after seeing what the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html" data-i13n="slk:Pixel 10 Pro;cpos:6;pos:1">Pixel 10 Pro</a> can do with its 5x zoom, any phone with a 3x telephoto doesn’t feel special. The limitations of the OP15’s hardware is especially noticeable when you try to push the camera beyond its maximum optical zoom. OnePlus says the camera offers 7x lossless zoom, but in my testing, I found there was a subtle drop in picture quality above 6x. At 10x and beyond, there's very noticeable pixel smearing.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two areas where the OP15’s cameras impress. Across both stills and video, it does a great job of measuring color temperature and ensuring images come out true to life. Even more impressive is the phone’s ability to capture a burst of photos at 10 fps, up from 6 fps on the OP13. If you’ve read one of my reviews before, you’ve probably noticed I enjoy photographing the cats in my neighborhood, and no phone has made that task as easy as the OP15.</p><p>As it’s already wintery in Toronto, I wasn’t able to test the OP15 new underwater camera mode. But if you live in a warmer climate, the feature is designed to make it easier to snap photos in the water by temporarily turning the OP15’s physical buttons into camera controls. This is also as good as any time to mention that OnePlus has shored up the OP15’s waterproofing. The phone is now rated IP68 against water and dust, and carries IP69 and IP69K protection against pressurized water at up to 176 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2 id="6f96b5d7-1ec4-4306-a6c4-398fd48301bf"><strong>Performance and battery life</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-3.jpg" style="height:3375px;width:6000px;" alt="In North America, the OP15's SUPERVOOC adapter can charge the phone at 80W.

In Geekbench’s processor suite, the OP15 put up a single-core score of 3,696 and a multi-core mark of 11,187. That puts it in select company with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html" data-i13n="slk:iPhone Air;cpos:8;pos:1">iPhone Air</a> and its A19 Pro chipset, which in our testing had a slight edge in single-core performance but didn’t perform nearly as well in the multi-core suite (likely due to thermal limitations). In real-world use, I tried my best to find a game or application that could trip up the OP15, but between its new Snapdragon chipset and the 16GB of RAM that came in my unit, the phone handled everything with ease.</p><p>It’s hard to describe how smooth the OnePlus 15 feels relative to other phones I’ve used recently. Every swipe and scroll feels nearly instantaneous. I suspect that’s a byproduct of the OP15’s dedicated touch response chip, which samples the screen at 3,200Hz. Speaking of the display, that 165Hz refresh rate I mentioned at the top is more of a forward-looking feature right now. As things stand, there are only seven games that can render at 165 fps. One of those, <em>PUBG</em>, does so through frame interpolation. So unless you’re an avid <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em> or <em>Clash of Clans</em> player, you won’t notice that benefit of the OP15’s screen, yet. Things could change in time, especially as more OEMs bring 165Hz displays to their phones. For now, the OP15 is still a great gaming phone, but it has yet to live up to its true potential.</p><p>As much performance as the OnePlus 15 offers, what’s more impressive is its 7,300mAh battery. It’s the result of a new technology the company calls Silicon NanoStack. It allowed OnePlus to make a denser battery and one it claims will age more gracefully over time, thanks to a design that retains more than 80 percent of its health after four years. Obviously, I haven’t had the OP15 long enough to test that claim, but what I can say is that it offers tremendous battery life out of the box. On our local video rundown test, it posted a time of 38 hours and 30 minutes, which is eight hours longer than the OnePlus 13, the previous record holder.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-7.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-7.jpg" style="height:3375px;width:6000px;" alt="The Aramid case is one of three cases OnePlus offers alongside the OP15.

With the included 80W SUPERVOOC adapter, the battery can go from dead to full in about 40 minutes. The one downside of how OnePlus has approached charging is that the phone doesn't support the Qi2 standard. It can wirelessly charge at 50W, but you'll need to buy the company's proprietary <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link rapid-with-clickid rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d8d4d385-7f93-4537-83d1-d5fb47d219ec&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2f732d6e-f057-4278-95ec-9d6965def5b6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OnePlus&amp;linkText=AIRVOOC+magnetic+puck&amp;custData=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_X2dsPTEqbHV2cHJvKl91cCpNUS4uKl9nYSpNVGc0TWpjek1qQTROaTR4TnpZek1EUXlNVFkwKl9nYV9LUzQ5UEhXWjhTKmN6RTNOak13TkRJeE5qTWtiekVrWnpFa2RERTNOak13TkRJeE56WWthalEzSkd3d0pHZ3cifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAay-kjY8lFdVTYtnQ9MWYikIqJfnKUPV0fb0lY0qoAXA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-airvooc-50w-magnetic-charger%3F_gl%3D1*luvpro*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg4MjczMjA4Ni4xNzYzMDQyMTY0*_ga_KS49PHWZ8S*czE3NjMwNDIxNjMkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjMwNDIxNzYkajQ3JGwwJGgw" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:OnePlus;elmt:;slk:AIRVOOC magnetic puck;cpos:9;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.oneplus.com/us/product/product/oneplus-airvooc-50w-magnetic-charger?_gl=1*luvpro*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg4MjczMjA4Ni4xNzYzMDQyMTY0*_ga_KS49PHWZ8S*czE3NjMwNDIxNjMkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjMwNDIxNzYkajQ3JGwwJGgw">AIRVOOC magnetic puck</a>.</p><h2 id="aa3a919e-8ca9-44df-b410-01a85f85bae8"><strong>Software</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-mind-space.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-mind-space.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Two screenshots showing of the OnePlus Mind Space" data-uuid="1880303c-9ba7-4be6-9edb-e740d9c70550"><figcaption>Two screenshots showing of the OnePlus Mind Space</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic for Engadget</div></figure><p>When he reviewed the OnePlus 13 in February, Engadget’s Sam Rutherford praised OnePlus for its restrained AI approach. Unfortunately, no company appears immune to the technology’s pull at this point, and in the months since, OnePlus has begun integrating more AI features into OxygenOS. Thankfully, many of those are either easy to ignore or situationally useful.</p><p>First, there’s Mind Space, which is functionally similar to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-essential-spaces-ai-powered-app-done-right-163042976.html" data-i13n="slk:Nothing’s Essential Space;cpos:10;pos:1">Nothing’s Essential Space</a>. You can either tap the Plus Key (if it’s configured for use with Mind Space) or swipe up on the touchscreen with three fingers to save a screenshot to the hub. From there, the OP15’s built-in LLM will summarize the image, and you can ask the model questions about it. It’s also possible to save voice memos to the hub, and OnePlus offers a few other AI tools there, including one for scanning documents. All of these work well, and like I said, if they’re not your thing, they’re easy to ignore.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-4.jpg" style="height:3301px;width:5869px;" alt="The OnePlus 15's volume rocker and power button are located on the right side of the phone.

A standout is some of the custom animations OnePlus has baked into the OS to accentuate the speed of the phone. I also find OnePlus has one of the best organized quick settings menus. There are just enough customization options there to make it feel powerful, but not enough to overwhelm.</p><p>One area where OnePlus could do better is software support. The company has pledged to provide the OP15 with four years of software updates and six years of security patches. That’s worse than both Google and Samsung, which have committed to supporting their latest phones for seven years.</p><h2 id="173757e2-fcfd-4bd3-97f4-e46fd221dc0b"><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-5.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oneplus-15-5.jpg" style="height:3375px;width:6000px;" alt="The OnePlus 15 sits on a set of icy concrete steps.

At the time, it was the company’s most expensive device ever, coming in at the same $750 price as the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-23-apple-iphone-xr-review.html" data-i13n="slk:iPhone XR;cpos:12;pos:1">iPhone XR</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-samsung-galaxy-s10e-review.html" data-i13n="slk:Galaxy S10e;cpos:13;pos:1">Galaxy S10e</a>. The appeal of that phone was its speedy Snapdragon 855 processor and the fact it was one of the first smartphones with a 90Hz AMOLED screen. It was also the first OnePlus phone with a camera that was more than just serviceable.</p><p>All these years later, the appeal of the OP15 feels similar. It’s a phone for those who value speed over everything else. The tricky thing about this phone is judging its value when its price could change tomorrow. As I mentioned earlier, in the US the OP15 will start at $900, with OnePlus warning pricing for both models could “change due to current market conditions.” At $1,000, the 16GB model is a compelling alternative to the Pixel 10 Pro XL, offering a newer processor, more storage and a significantly bigger battery.</p><p>Here’s the thing: Google has already aggressively discounted the entire Pixel 10 lineup, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-is-300-off-in-this-early-black-friday-deal-123036348.html" data-i13n="slk:until Black Friday;cpos:14;pos:1">until Black Friday</a>, you can get the Pro XL for $899 — $100 less than the 16GB OnePlus 15. For most people, I think that’s the play, given both the Pro and Pro XL have the better telephoto camera and Google has promised to support all of its latest phones for seven years. That said, if you’re okay with a worse camera overall, the OP15 has a lot going for it, and provided OnePlus can successfully navigate an uncertain tariff regime, it will end up not just one of the best phones of 2025 but much of 2026 too.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html?src=rss]]></description>

The 25 percent discount applies to multiple colors, too.</p> 
<p>We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html">best MacBook computers</a>.

The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That&#39;s well beyond a full day of work.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it&#39;s technically just a 13-inch panel. There&#39;s support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.</p> 
<p>This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There&#39;s no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html">released the MacBook Pro M5</a>, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DoorDash is bringing its robot delivery service to Miami, following an initial <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/doordash-starts-robot-deliveries-in-la-and-chicago-172358704.html"><ins>rollout</ins></a> in Los Angeles and Chicago earlier this year with over 600 participating merchants. The company continues to work with Coco Robotics as part of its push towards a &quot;muliti-modal system&quot; that allows it to make human, robot and drone deliveries at scale.</p>
<p>As well as adding a third city to the initiative, DoorDash also now takes orders from DashMart, its delivery-only convenience store chain for groceries and household items. This means customers will receive robot deliveries from national grocers and retailers as well as restaurants.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DoorDash has a dedicated robotics and automation division called DoorDash Labs, which is focused on forging new partnerships that allow it to meet increased demand with more environmentally friendly methods of delivery. Earlier this year it began operating <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://wing.com/news/wing-and-doordash-tee-off-first-ever-drone-delivery-service-in-charlotte"><ins>drone deliveries</ins></a> in Charlotte with Wing, and as well as using Coco’s self-driving robots, DoorDash recently <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/doordash-introduces-a-cute-delivery-robot-named-dot-130036016.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> its own in-house developed delivery robot called Dot.</p>
<p>Decidedly cuter than its Coco colleague, Dot is designed for quick neighborhood trips and is able to navigate roads, as well as bike lanes and sidewalks. Dot is currently being piloted in Arizona, and when rolled out more widely is expected to fulfill cheaper deliveries, with DoorDash ensuring its human staff that the robot will complement, rather than replace them.</p>
<p>With fully autonomous technology still in its infancy, lower-risk hyper-local deliveries are being explored by a number of food delivery companies that have traditionally relied on gig workers to fulfill orders. At the beginning of this year, GrubHub <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/grubhub-is-bringing-new-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses-140028029.html"><ins>partnered</ins></a> with the autonomous robot delivery company Avride to scale up the latter’s existing robot delivery offering on college campuses including the Ohio State University.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/doordash-customers-in-miami-can-now-receive-their-food-orders-from-robots-140017928.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/agentic-checkout-holiday-ai-shopping" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> a trio of new AI-powered shopping features. The tech company is rolling out more conversational search capabilities for shopping in AI Mode, so that buyers can make more specific and descriptive queries to find exactly what they&#39;re looking for. The AI Mode results will also be formatted to match the type of search, delivering shoppable images for prompts with a more visual angle or side-by-side comparisons of different traits for shoppers considering several options of what to buy.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also two new agentic shopping features. First is an agentic checkout for finding and buying an item at a particular price. Shoppers can use Google&#39;s price-tracking feature to set the sale price they want to pay for a particular product, and can opt to allow Google&#39;s AI to purchase the item when it hits the desired discount. Users will have to confirm the purchase and shipping info before the agentic checkout purchase is completed via Google Pay. For now, agentic checkout is limited to US shoppers at select online retailers including Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and certain Shopify stores; Google said it plans to support more sellers in the future.&nbsp;(Presumably Amazon <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-and-perplexity-are-fighting-over-the-future-of-ai-shopping-215445479.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">will not be one of them</a>.)</p><p>Finally, once you know what you want to purchase, Gemini can call local businesses to ask about product availability. The agentic AI can gather information about prices, stock and current promotions, ask relevant follow-up questions, then will email the results to the user. The first wave of categories that will support AI phone calling are toys, health and beauty, and electronics, and it will be available to US Search users.&nbsp;</p><p>Google has been rapidly expanding its shopping tools to include AI integrations, with new resources such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-tool-for-virtually-trying-on-clothes-is-now-available-in-the-us-144342056.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">virtual clothing try-ons</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-to-see-your-feet-for-virtual-shopping-purposes-165446054.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">shoe shopping</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-agentic-ai-checkout-to-shopping-140000930.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hideo Kojima has unveiled <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/deathstranding-animation-series-announcement"><em>Death Stranding Isolations</em></a> (working title), an original anime series based on his franchise, coming to Disney+ in 2027. The gaming legend made the announcement at a Disney+ event in Hong Kong alongside series director Sano Takayuki. It will be the first Kojima Productions&#39; partnership with a global streaming platform, with Kojima serving as an executive producer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The series will tell a new story set within the Death Stranding universe and not draw from any of the games&#39; narratives. All we know so far is that it &quot;will follow a young man and woman as they set out on an adventure&quot; and that traditional hand-drawn 2D animation will be used. Concept art displayed at the event was created by <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045</em> character designer, Ilya Kuvshinov.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Death Stranding</em> (the game) originally launched in 2019 starring Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydou. The franchise finally got a sequel earlier this year with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/who-is-this-final-six-minute-death-stranding-2-trailer-actually-for-161728737.html"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>In 2023, Kojima <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/a24-will-help-bring-the-death-stranding-movie-to-life-171735945.html">revealed</a> that production company A24 was collaborating with Kojima Productions on a Death Stranding live action film project. At the time, he said that &quot;I aim to present a new dimension of cinematic adaptation that goes beyond merely turning a game into a live-action movie.&quot; That film will be directed by Michael Sarnoski (<em>A Quiet Place: Day One). </em></p>
<p>Live action series and movies based on games seem to be everywhere of late, but the number of animated productions is also growing. Many of those are on Netflix, including <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-animated-series-arrives-on-october-14-145632934.html"><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch,</em></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html"><em>Arcane</em></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-new-castlevania-series-other-game-related-reveals-184651262.html"><em>Castlevania</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-ending-with-its-second-season-193502328.html"><em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>. <em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> (working title), appears to be the first gaming IP-based animation series for Disney+.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/a-new-death-stranding-series-is-coming-to-disney-in-2027-133018605.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify is testing a new feature that could make it easier to pick up an audiobook that you&#39;ve ignored a little too long. The streaming service is rolling out recaps for audiobooks that can summarize the story up to where a user stopped listening. Recaps will be available once a user has gotten 15 to 20 minutes into the audiobook and will be updated to reflect the point the listener has reached without spoiling anything yet to come. It could help listeners to finish audiobooks they haven&#39;t revisited in awhile without needed to restart from the beginning, and it might be handy just to refresh your memory on the plot.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an AI-powered feature, but Spotify noted that it will not be training any large language models on authors&#39; content or developing voice generation from narrators&#39; performances. For now, recaps are only available on Spotify&#39;s iOS app for a select number of English-language titles. The company said it plans to add recaps for more content in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotify-is-adding-recaps-for-audiobooks-133000324.html?src=rss]]></description>

It also supports <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon&#39;s Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">Samsung&#39;s The Frame</a>) while the device is in standby. It&#39;s also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-is-better-as-a-retro-gaming-device-than-a-streamer-160022685.html">works well as a retro game emulator</a>, too.</p> 
<p>The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device&#39;s low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff.</p>

This model doesn&#39;t support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it&#39;s certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.</p>
