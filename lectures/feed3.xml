                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-shutting-down-its-desktop-messenger-app-202539375.html">Meta</a> is launching new tools aimed at trying to protect Messenger and WhatsApp users from potential scams. The company says its teams have &quot;detected and disrupted&quot; nearly 8 million accounts associated with scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines since the beginning of 2025. It has also taken action on over 21,000 Pages on Facebook pretending to be customer support services of legitimate companies. But much still needs to be done to squash scams, specifically those <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/us-attorneys-general-band-robocalls-055620761.html">targeting the elderly</a> who may not be as tech-savvy or may not be aware of the scammers&#39; latest schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On WhatsApp, the company will start showing users warning notices if they attempt to share their screen with someone not on their contacts list during a video call. Scammers sometimes get their targets to share their screens in order to steal sensitive information. In the warning window pictured below, Meta tells users outright to only share their screens with people they trust, since they will be able to see anything displayed on their phones, including their banking info.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company is also testing advanced scam detection tools in Messenger chats for mobile. When a user receives a potentially scammy message, a warning notice will pop up, telling them the message is suspicious and that they can forward it to Meta for an AI review. If Meta AI detects a potential scam, it will show the user a list of common scam signs, such as job offers in exchange for money, job offers promising fast cash and work from home offers for jobs that can&#39;t possibly be done remotely. It also reminds users not to wire transfer money or send gift cards, which are very common methods scammers use to steal money from their victims. At the bottom of the page, users will have the option to report and block the account that sent them the message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta didn&#39;t say when the new Messenger warning tool will roll out widely. For now, it&#39;s encouraging users to set up passkeys for quick identity verification and to run Security Checkup to review their security settings and get recommendations, including updating their passwords.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-warn-whatsapp-and-messenger-users-against-scams-120048067.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re not a big fan of the, well, glass in iOS 26&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">Liquid Glass interface</a>, Apple has apparently heard you. The latest iOS 26.1 Beta 4 has a new toggle that lets you apply a &quot;tinted&quot; setting to boost the opacity of elements and add contrast, making them stand out better against the background, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/20/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-toggle/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> reported. &quot;Choose your preferred look for Liquid Glass. Clear is more transparent, revealing the content beneath. Tinted increases opacity and adds more contrast,&quot; the description states.</p>
<p>The new toggle (Settings &gt; Display and Brightness on iPhone or iPad and System Settings &gt; Appearance macOS) is a rare instance of Apple altering course on a design based on user input. The company said the setting was added as many beta users desired a more opaque option for Liquid Glass. That&#39;s putting it mildly, as you may have noticed on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/search?q=%23liquidglass">social media</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1njqlo5/ios_26s_liquid_glass_design_draws_criticism_from/">Reddit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The setting is more noticeable on some areas of iOS than others. Toggling it from clear to tinted changes everything throughout iOS and affects apps and lock screen notifications as well. Other new changes in the latest beta include a Camera swipe toggle, a new slide-to-stop feature for alarms and timers, Settings updates, new Apple Intelligence languages and a new Apple TV app icon. If you&#39;re in the beta program, you can download the latest version now.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-261-beta-4-lets-you-make-liquid-glass-frosted-110021700.html?src=rss]]></description>

Your humble narrator’s Ring Chimes started turning their night lights on and off entirely at random, with no prompting from yours truly.</p>
<p>The company has already fixed the DNS issue that caused the outage, but a failure like this, which knocks out so damn much of the internet, should serve as a reminder. After all, having so many critical systems in the same basket means that when something goes wrong, a lot of the internet stops working. All at once.</p>

<p>It’s teeth-grindingly frustrating that Meta seems to be the company that has worked out how to make a truly transformative pair of smart glasses. Karissa Bell has <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">reviewed its new Ray-Ban Display and has plenty of praise for so much of what it can do</a>. You should read her exhaustive review to learn more, but the biggest barriers to adoption are size and price. But you can bet your bottom dollar the second or third generation of these are going to be a smash hit. At least until Meta gets rocked by another scandal that prompts people to deactivate their accounts.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AI is the star of Yelp&#39;s fall product update. The review site has updated Yelp Assistant, its chatbot to answer users&#39; questions, rolling the tool out for all business categories. Its responses will draw on information from the business&#39; website as well as posts by other Yelp users. The chatbot will also remember past queries and preferences when it&#39;s used for finding services. Saved information can be managed in the Yelp app under Yelp Assistant memory settings.</p>
<p>Yelp has been pushing more artificial intelligence into its platform, adding <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/yelp-adds-ai-powered-scores-to-business-pages-195131103.html"><ins>Review Insights</ins></a> in December and announcing <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/yelp-will-use-ai-to-help-restaurants-answer-calls-and-make-phone-reservations-143320476.html"><ins>calling features</ins></a> in April. The AI-powered calling is rolling out in the company&#39;s fall update as Yelp Host and Yelp Receptionist. Yelp Host is specifically for table-service restaurants, and promises the ability to take reservations, change bookings and capture special requests. It is available now starting at $149 a month, or $99 a month for customers with a Yelp Guest Manager plan. Yelp Receptionist can manage calls for any &quot;eligible local businesses.&quot; Subscriptions to this AI-powered service start at $99 a month and will begin rolling out this week.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are several other updates from Yelp, but one of the more interesting ones is Menu Vision. With this resource, pointing your camera at a restaurant&#39;s menu will show photos of the dish in question along with reviews about that particular item. Menu Vision will arrive on the iOS and Android apps this week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/yelp-is-getting-more-ai-including-an-upgraded-chatbot-110051320.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-an-action-camera">What to consider before choosing an action camera</h2> 
<p>Action cameras have certain traits that separate them from regular cameras or smartphones. The most important is ruggedness that makes them resistant to water, dust and shocks. Most models are now waterproof without the need for a separate enclosure. At the same time, you can purchase housing accessories to make them waterproof to even greater depths.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Video quality is also key. Every model we recommend goes to at least 4K 60fps, but some models like GoPro’s latest <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/gopro-hero-13-black-release-date-price-hands-on-impressions-130027978.html">Hero 13</a> boost resolution up to 5.3K 60fps, or even 8K 30fps with the Insta360 Ace Pro 2. That allows you to crop in on shots and capture vertical video at higher resolutions for social media. And for slow-mo, you’ll want at least 120 fps video, preferably at 4K or at least 2.7K.</p> 
<p>Another nice feature is log video that improves dynamic range when filming on sunny, contrasty days. And if you film in dim environments, you’ll want the largest sensor possible for the best low-light performance.</p> 
<p>Next is the question of flat versus 360 video. 360 cams have become incredibly popular lately because they capture video all around the camera, even above and below. Then, you can reframe the shots in post, cutting from a cool bike trick to your reaction, for example. Or, you can post the entire 360 video online and let the audience choose which angle they want to see.</p> 
<p>For activities with bumps and jolts like mountain biking, stabilization is incredibly important. You want your video to look smooth, but still convey the thrill and speed of the action. Cameras from DJI, GoPro and Insta360 are all good in this regard, but GoPro’s Hero 13 still tops the list.</p> 
<p>Some action cameras are easier to handle and use, so take that into account as well. You’ll want bright and colorful displays both front and back, buttons you won’t have to fumble to find and easy-to-use menus. Remote control is another factor that can ease operation. And you’ll want to check which software is available to improve stabilization, edit video, remove selfie sticks and more.</p> 
<p>Size has also become a factor, with tiny cameras having become an all-new category recently. Mini sized models like Insta360’s Go 3S and Go Ultra, along with DJI’s new Osmo Nano, let you separate the camera from the display for maximum portability. Whether it’s mounted on a hat or your chest, you’ll barely notice it’s there.</p> 
<p>Then there are accessories. Do you need helmet or chest mounts, waterproof housings or battery charger? GoPro has the largest number as it’s been around the longest, but DJI and Insta360 now have a solid accessory lineup and both make handy wireless mics that connect directly with their cameras. And of course, battery life is critical for action shooting as it’s hard to change one when you’re out surfing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-action-camera-130017459.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It felt like half of the internet was dealing with a hangover from the morning of October 19 to the early hours of October 20. A severe Amazon Web Services outage took out many, many websites, apps, games and other services that rely on Amazon’s cloud division to stay up and running. That included a long list of popular software like Venmo, Snapchat, Canva and <em>Fortnite</em>. Even Amazon's own assistant Alexa stuttered, and if you were wondering why the internet seemed to be against you — you weren't imagining it. The good news is that, Amazon <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">announced</a> by 6:53PM Eastern time on October 20 that it resolved the "increased error rates and latencies for AWS Services."</p>
<p>The company said it "identified the trigger of the event as DNS resolution issues for the regional DynamoDB service endpoints." It ran into more problems as it tried to solve the outage, but it was eventually able to fix everything. "By 3:01 PM, all AWS services returned to normal operations," it said.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At about 4:30PM ET on October 20, things seemed to be returning back to normal. Apps like Venmo and Lyft, which were either slow to respond or completely nonresponsive before, were appearing to behave smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of 1:15PM ET on October 20, multiple services were unavailable, including asking Alexa for the weather or to turn off lights in your home. The Lyft app was also slower to respond than usual, and Venmo transactions were not completing.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS service health page</a> at the time, Amazon was looking into "increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services" in the US-EAST-1 region (i.e. data centers in Northern Virginia) as of 3:11AM ET on Monday. By 5:01AM, AWS had figured out that a DNS resolution issue with its DynamoDB API was the cause of the outage. DynamoDB is a database that holds info for AWS clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At about 12:08PM ET, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-service-disruptions-outage-update">posted a small statement</a> that reiterated the above and added that the "underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT." According to the notice, some Amazon "customers still continue to experience increased error rates with AWS services in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region due to issues with launching new EC2 instances." Amazon also said Amazon.com and Amazon subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer service support operations have been impacted.</p>
<p>“Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data,” Mike Chapple, a teaching professor of IT, analytics and operations at University of Notre Dame, told <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/amazon-tech-outage-10-20-25-intl?post-id=cmgz331910000356o8os98qu2"><em>CNN</em></a>. “It’s as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia.”</p>
<p>As of 6:35AM, AWS said it had fully mitigated the DNS issue and that "most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now." However, the knock-on effect caused issues with other AWS services, including EC2, a virtual machine service on which many companies build online applications.</p>
<p>At 8:48AM, AWS said it was "making progress on resolving the issue with new EC2 instance launches in the US-EAST-1 Region." It recommended that clients not tie new deployments to specific Availability Zones (i.e. one or more data centers in a given region) "so that EC2 has flexibility" in picking a zone that may be a better option.</p>
<p>At 9:42AM, Amazon noted on the status page that although it had applied "multiple mitigations" across several Availability Zones in US-EAST-1, it was "still experiencing elevated errors for new EC2 instance launches." As such, AWS was "rate limiting new instance launches to aid recovery." The company added at 10:14AM that it was seeing "significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region." Even once all the issues are resolved, AWS will have a significant backlog of requests and other factors to process, so it'll take some time for everything to recover.</p>
<p>Many, many, many companies use US-EAST-1 for their AWS deployments, which is why it felt like half of the internet was knocked offline on Monday morning. As of mid-morning, tons of websites and other services were sluggish or offering up error messages. Outage reports for a broad swathe of services spiked on Down Detector. Along with Amazon's own services, users reported issues with the likes of banks, airlines, Disney+, Snapchat, Reddit, Lyft, Apple Music, Pinterest, <em>Fortnite, Roblox </em>and <em>The New York Times </em>— sorry to anyone whose <em>Wordle</em> streaks may be at risk.</p>
<p>Sites like Reddit have posted their <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.redditstatus.com/">own status updates</a>, and though they don't explicitly mention AWS, it's possible that the services' paths may cross somewhere in the pipelines.</p>
<p>AWS offers a lot of useful features to clients, such as the ability for websites and apps to automatically scale compute and server capacity up and down as needed to handle ebbs and flows in traffic. It also has data centers around the world. That kind of infrastructure is attractive to companies that serve a global  audience and need to stay online around the clock. As of mid-2025, it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">estimated</a> that AWS' share of the worldwide cloud infrastructure market was 30 percent. But incidents such as this highlight that relying on just a few providers to be the backbone of much of the internet is a bit of a problem.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Home products company Kohler is launching a new Kohler Health division, and its first product is a $599 camera for your toilet. The item, dubbed Dekoda, is equipped with sensors that analyze whatever liquid or solid waste goes into the toilet bowl with &quot;validated machine learning algorithms.&quot; The data, which can offer insights on hydration and gut health as well as detecting the presence of blood, then goes to Kohler Health&#39;s iPhone app, although Android support is in the works. It comes with a magnetic charging pad and a wall-mounted remote that can optionally use Bluetooth fingerprint authorization so that you don&#39;t learn way more than you want to about your guests.</p>
<p>I must salute the PR person who came up with this gem from the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kohler-co-launches-kohler-health-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-health-and-wellness-in-the-home-302584350.html"><ins>release</ins></a>: &quot;By turning the bathroom into a connected, data-informed health and wellness hub, Kohler Health empowers individuals to turn ordinary routines into proactive, personalized experiences.&quot; Because who doesn&#39;t want to be proactive about pee? Health data is great, no arguments here. But this seems like a pretty extreme and expensive way to figure out if you&#39;re drinking enough water. Maybe I&#39;m in the minority with my skepticism, however, because this isn&#39;t the first instance we&#39;ve seen of toilet-bowl tech for better health. Withings introduced a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-urine-monitoring-device-ces-2023-010057961.html"><ins>monitor</ins></a> a few years back for analyzing urine streams, which you can buy for a mere $500.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re just that passionate about tracking your biometrics, Dekoda products are expected to ship starting tomorrow. You&#39;ll also need to sign up for a Kohler Health subscription on top of the product cost, and there are individual and family plan options.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kohlers-dekoda-is-600-camera-for-your-toilet-225942144.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>X is finally following through on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-reportedly-soliciting-people-to-buy-recycled-user-handles-for-50000-174504242.html">long-rumored</a> plans <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/XHandles/status/1979714053221257393">to sell</a> old user handles, and some of the most sought-after usernames could fetch millions of dollars. The company shared more details about and opened a waitlist for its &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://handles.x.com/">handle marketplace</a>,&quot; that will enable paying subscribers to request and buy &quot;inactive&quot; handles.</p>
<p>According to the company, X will make two types of &quot;inactive&#39; handles available: &quot;priority&quot; usernames that may include &quot;full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations&quot; and &quot;rare&quot; handles that consist of &quot;short, generic, or culturally significant names.&quot; Subscribers to X&#39;s Premium+ and Premium Business tiers will eventually be able to request some &quot;priority&quot; handles as part of their subscription. The company says @PizzaEater and @GabrielJones are possible examples of such handles. Notably, this process requires what essentially amounts to an indefinite subscription to X Premium, as the company says it will revoke priority handles if an account&#39;s subscription lapses.</p>

<p>The process for acquiring a &quot;rare&quot; handle is a lot less clear. X says that it will offer some rare handles through &quot;public drops&quot; and that those will be given away for free &quot;based on merit&quot; and that multiple users will be able to apply. X will take a user&#39;s engagement and &quot;past contributions&quot; to the platform into account when deciding who gets these handles. The company will also make some handles available for sale via an invitation-only process. These prices will be &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;determined by a number of factors including popularity of word, character length, and cultural significance.&quot; These usernames could include common one-word usernames like @one, @fly or @compute, according to examples provided by X. They could also be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Some handles are included with a Premium+ or Premium Business subscription,&quot; X wrote in an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://handles.x.com/how-it-works">FAQ</a>. &quot;Others – especially Rare handles – may be priced anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.&quot; People who buy a supposedly rare handle will need to have a Premium+ or Premium Business subscription in order to start the process, but won&#39;t be required to maintain one in order to keep the handle.</p>
<p>In a separate &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://legal.x.com/en/x-handle-transfer-agreement.html#:~:text=Confidential%20Information%20does%20not%20include,you%20may%20have%20with%20X.">handle transfer agreement</a>,&quot; X describes its handle-buying scheme as an &quot;evolving initiative&quot; that it hopes will be adopted by other social media companies in the future. &quot;We are establishing a new standard for social media handles—a framework we hope the broader industry will adopt, similar to how Community Notes has influenced online transparency,&quot; the company wrote.</p>
<p>Andrew Allemann, the publisher of Domain Name Wire, a publication that tracks the domain name industry, says that there are some similarities between X&#39;s plan to sell handles and the marketplace for expired domains. &quot;For a long time, people have been buying and selling handles off of X, and X hasn&#39;t been getting a cut of that,&quot; he told Engadget. &quot;So in some ways, I think this will get some of the better handles to be more used on the platform.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said he would have concerns about some of the terms in X&#39;s policies, which allow it to &quot;reclaim&#39;&#39; handles if they become inactive. The company&#39;s current &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-x-accounts">inactive account policy</a>&quot; defines an inactive account as one that hasn&#39;t been logged into for 30 days. &quot;I would definitely want a firmer contract if I were to pay money for a handle,&quot; Allemann says. &quot;I would want some rights baked into a contract that says it can&#39;t just be taken away. I certainly want a longer period of inactivity before it can be taken away.&quot;</p>
<p>X also has a history of commandeering desirable handles from users that <em>were</em> actively using them. The company took the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190824506/the-man-who-once-tweeted-as-x-wasnt-informed-when-the-company-took-over-his-hand">@X handle</a> from a San Francisco photographer in 2023 without compensating him, though he was offered &quot;merch&quot; and a tour of X&#39;s headquarters. That same year, it also took the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/x-commandeers-music-handle-from-user-with-half-a-million-followers.html">@music handle</a> from a longtime user with more than a half million followers. Last year, the company swiped the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musk-takes-america-x-handle">@America</a> handle from a reported Donald Trump critic. The handle is now used by Musk&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/america">super PAC</a>.</p>
<p>X&#39;s plan to give away handles based on &quot;merit&quot; raises additional questions about who the platform could decide to reward and penalize. The company didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Allemann says that all social media users should remember they don&#39;t own any of the content they publish on company platforms. &quot;If you create your website, you control it, and people can always come to it. On social media, the single billionaire owner of it could decide they don&#39;t like you, and it&#39;s pretty much within their rights to kick you off, or demote you, or change the algorithm to impact you as well.&quot;</p>

The team at the company&#39;s Chelsea campus were notified on Sunday that a possible bed bug infestation had been discovered in the building and were told to remain at home so the location could be treated. As if working over the weekend wasn&#39;t enough of a bummer. Fortunately, exterminators collected their bug bounty, and employees were allowed to return to the building on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Google told employees to file a report if they had symptoms of bed bug bites or saw evidence of bed bugs on site, according to an email sent by the company and obtained by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-beg-bug-infestation-at-googles-manhattan-offices/"><em>Wired</em></a>.

<p>Are you still using Windows 10 on your desktop or laptop? If so, you need to know this: As of October 14, Microsoft moved the software to its "end of life" phase. What that means is that while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. That leaves you with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html">three options</a> to make sure your computer remains secure:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>You can <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-new-computers-to-replace-your-old-windows-10-pc-134500000.html">buy a new PC</a> that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook).</p></li>
<li><p>Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The third option is easier than it sounds — and can now be done for free in many cases — so we'll focus on that one here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-sign-up-for-windows-10-extended-security-updates-on-your-computer">How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer</h2>
<p>We can <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-pressured-to-extend-free-windows-10-security-updates-in-most-of-europe-164533056.html">question Microsoft's motives</a> for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely.</p>
<p>At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-1-make-sure-your-pc-is-up-to-date"><strong>Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date</strong></h3>
<p>You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings &gt; System &gt; About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-2-make-sure-youre-using-an-administrator-account"><strong>Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account</strong></h3>
<p>If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see "Administrator" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings &gt; Your Info.)</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-3-verify-if-your-pc-is-eligible-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-or-not"><strong>Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not)</strong></h3>
<p>If you see an option to upgrade to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html">Windows 11</a>, just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-4-enroll-in-extended-security-updates"><strong>Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates</strong></h3>
<p>Sign up for ESU by selecting Update &amp; Security from the Settings menu. Click the "Enroll Now" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it).</p>

<p>If you're not seeing the "Enroll now" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above).</p>

(Screenshots/Engadget)</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-5-choose-your-upgrade-method"><strong>Step 5: Choose your upgrade method</strong></h3>
<p>Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to use your administrator account to get started.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDjeKN1_Es"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e52590d0-a60f-11f0-96ff-415266e25201" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e52590d0-a60f-11f0-96ff-415266e25201" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" data-uuid="ab17ee67-0c79-3a86-b04a-7ee38e44c5dc"><figcaption>Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube)</figcaption></figure></a>
<p>That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-pressured-to-extend-free-windows-10-security-updates-in-most-of-europe-164533056.html">no strings attached</a>.) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this "free" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe.</p>
<p>The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=973badc7-4f72-4f95-82dc-34d0ba6aff68&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=5+GB+of+storage&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL21pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUvb25lZHJpdmUvZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTczYmFkYzctNGY3Mi00Zjk1LTgyZGMtMzRkMGJhNmFmZjY4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL21pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUvb25lZHJpdmUvZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb76BKdsZUEVk6dLEl2FB2BKQaUjjCPoN1dC7mQw4-c5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fonedrive%2Ffree-online-cloud-storage" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/free-online-cloud-storage">5 GB of storage</a>. Anything more, and you’ll need to pay up for Microsoft's OneDrive services. But thankfully, you can turn off anything you don't want to back up by going to Settings &gt; OneDrive and toggling off options like Documents, Pictures and Videos to get in under the free threshold to start.</p>
<p>Once you're signed in, a window will pop up that says "Add this device to receive Extended Security Updates." Click Add Device to enroll it. Click Done.</p>
<p>A note: Thanks to YouTube's <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ExplainingComputers">Explaining Computers channel</a>, where we grabbed the screenshot above (since our test PC was already signed up for cloud backups, and didn't provide the splash screen to choose options). You can watch their <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDjeKN1_Es">full video</a> if you'd like a deeper dive into the process.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-thats-it-youre-done-until-next-year"><strong>That's it, you're done! (Until next year)</strong></h2>
<p>You've got 12 more months to figure out an alternative upgrade path to Windows 11. If anything changes next year, we'll update this story with what your next steps are.</p>

The company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-galaxy-event-worlds-wide-open-a-new-era-of-multimodal-ai">has scheduled a livestream event</a> for October 21 at 10PM ET.</p>
<p>The event will be streamed live via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">company&#39;s YouTube page</a> and on the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">official Samsung Newsroom site</a>. We don&#39;t know how long the stream will be, but Samsung promises that Project Moohan will open up the &quot;true potential&quot; of mixed-reality devices.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just a reveal for a mixed-reality headset. Moohan is the very first device that uses <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html">Google&#39;s new Android XR operating system</a>, which has been specifically designed for XR, VR and AR devices like glasses and headsets. We&#39;ll finally get to see what all the fuss is about and what kind of new tools the OS brings to the table.</p>
<p>Samsung says that this technology &quot;seamlessly blends everyday utility with immersive new experiences.&quot; Hopefully we&#39;ll get a look at both everyday utility and immersive new experiences during the livestream.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have official specs about the headset itself, but there have been <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">plenty of leaks and rumors</a> that will be confirmed or refuted during the stream. Leaks <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/why-im-so-excited-for-samsung-android-xr-event-and-its-not-just-the-headset/">have suggested</a> it includes a high-end display, advanced tracking and Gemini integration. These same leaks indicate a potential price tag of $1,800 to $2,800, making it more of a rival to the Apple Vision Pro than <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Meta&#39;s new Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/how-to-watch-samsung-unveil-its-android-xr-headset-184820772.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Five years after the release of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-fan-edition-extended-hands-on-143012969.html"><ins>Galaxy S20 FE</ins></a>, Samsung has settled into a predictable pattern with its "Fan Edition" line of phones. Each new phone doesn't offer much new or different from its immediate predecessor, with the company opting to offer iterative updates instead.</p> 
<p>That might have been fine before, but with the arrival of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html"><ins>Nothing Phone 3a Pro</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html"><ins>Pixel 10</ins></a> — devices that changed the value proposition in their respective categories — the S25 FE feels woefully out of touch with a market that's changing to meet people's demands. There's not much here that makes the new Galaxy S25 FE stand out, and any "upgrades" aren't substantive.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>When I first took the S25 FE out of the box, I thought Samsung had played a cruel trick on me. The phone looks identical to its predecessor, sporting the same brushed aluminum frame that's been the company's go-to for years now. I had to dig the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-review-a-great-phone-but-i-wish-it-was-cheaper-190032655.html">S24 FE</a> out of my gadgets drawer to compare the two phones before I confirmed they were in fact different devices.</p> 
<p>The physical differences are minor. Samsung has tweaked the dimensions of the new phone, making it slightly shorter, wider and thinner. Specifically, the S25 FE measures in at 6.35 x 3.02 x 0.29 inches, while its predecessor was 6.38 x 3.04 x 0.31 inches. The new phone is also protected by Samsung's "enhanced Armor" aluminum frame.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More noticeable is that the S25 FE is lighter than last year's model, coming in at 6.7 ounces, down from 7.51 ounces. This is despite the fact the new device has a higher-capacity 4,900mAh battery. Together, these changes don't make the S25 FE easier to hold if you have small hands (just ask my girlfriend), but it does feel better balanced than its predecessor. One issue with the size of the S25 FE is the placement of the in-display fingerprint sensor. It's right at the bottom of the screen. I found this made it awkward to unlock the phone with my thumb — and I'm someone with big hands.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="14cc8ec8-fd73-4b16-9c1f-abf9910b60a2" /> 
<p>Another slight difference is the finish on the back of the phone. This time around, Samsung has gone with a matte coating, instead of the glossy finish it used on the S24 FE. It's a welcome change since it makes the new model less prone to smudging and attracting fingerprints. I just wish Samsung had decided to offer the S25 FE in more fun colors. At release, it's available in four colorways: white, icy blue, jet black and navy (pictured). So, if you don't like blue, I'm sorry.</p> 
<p>Amid the slight design tweaks, Samsung has gone with the same screen it did last year. The S25 FE has a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, with a panel that offers a 120Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution. The S24 FE's vibrant screen was one of the best parts of last year's model, and it's the same with S25 FE. It's easy to see the screen in bright sunlight, thanks to the fact it can push 1,900 nits of peak brightness. It's also vibrant, and with HDR10 support included, great for watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Samsung made a single tweak to the Galaxy S25 FE's camera hardware. Like last year's model, the new phone has a 50-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and a fast f/1.8 aperture lens. Once again, it also has an 8MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide angle that offers a 123-degree field of view.</p> 
<p>The one addition is a higher resolution 12MP front-facing camera with a faster f/2.2 aperture lens. For selfies, the S24 FE made do with a 10MP sensor and f/2.4 lens. If the new front-facing camera included phase detection autofocus (PDAF), it would be the same one that's available on the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-170040665.html"><ins>Galaxy S25</ins></a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't and that's a shame because PDAF greatly increases the likelihood your photos will come out sharp and in focus.</p> 
<p>It's also a shame Samsung decided not to update the FE's telephoto camera. Before the Nothing 3a Pro, that was one of the features that made the S24 FE stand out in its price range. In 2025, however, the S25 FE's telephoto feels outdated. It doesn't offer the 5x optical zoom of the Pixel 10 nor the 50MP of resolution and periscope zoom you get with the 3a Pro. Coming from the former, the FE's telephoto camera felt limiting. With only 8MP of resolution, trying to snap a photo at anything beyond 5x zoom was pointless; it would just turn out a blurry mess.</p> 
<p>As for FE's other cameras, they're decent if uninspiring. The 50MP camera is the best of the bunch, capable of capturing detailed, good-looking photos even in low light. The ultrawide, meanwhile, is mostly forgettable. It does an okay job of capturing big scenes, but it's lacking in dynamic range and detail. The selfie camera is a noticeable upgrade from the one that came with last year's model, and produces pleasing photos that are on par with what you can expect from the S25's front-facing camera.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, snapping pictures with the S25 FE feels like using a flagship phone from a few years ago. The one thing that saves it from being a complete blast from the past is the inclusion of Samsung's generative photo editing software, which you can use to remove distracting objects from photos. Of the AI photo apps I've tested, Samsung's is among the best at editing out objects without smearing the background. You can also use the generative edit to add things to a photo, but as you might expect, this doesn't work as well as removing them.</p>

<p>On paper, the S25 FE should offer better performance than its predecessor, thanks to Samsung's decision to equip the phone with its Exynos 2400 chipset over the cut-down Exynos 2400e it used on last year's model. In practice the two are about on par with one another. On Geekbench's processor test, the Exynos 2400 delivered a 2,144 single-core score and a 7,059 multi-core score. That's not much better than the 2,140 and 6,690 I recorded last fall on the S24 FE.</p> 
<p>Still, it's a more impressive showing than either the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html"><ins>Pixel 9a</ins></a> and Nothing 3a Pro had when my colleague Sam Rutherford and I put their Tensor G4 and Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chips through Geekbench earlier this year. For comparison, the former delivered a modest 1,665 on single-core performance and 4,294 on multi-core performance. The latter scored an even less impressive 1,115 and 3,082 respectively.</p> 
<p>In real-world use, the Exynos 2400 feels snappy. Scrolling is fast and fluid, as is opening apps and switching between them. Gaming performance is also impressive, with the chip able to handle the 60 fps modes in graphically demanding games like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-immortal-review-120001807.html"><em><ins>Diablo Immortal</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/"><em><ins>League of Legends: Wild Rift</ins></em></a> without dropping frames.</p> 
<p>Last year, Samsung said it redesigned the S24 FE's vapor chamber to make it bigger and improve cooling. With the S25 FE, that component is an additional 10 percent larger. However, if the new vapor chamber made a difference to the phone's thermals, I had a hard time telling. Both the S25 FE and S24 FE got warm after about 15 to 20 minutes of gaming. The new phone never got hot to the point I couldn't hold it anymore, but it also didn't feel noticeably cooler than the S24 FE running the same games.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As mentioned at the top, the S25 FE has a larger 4,900mAh battery. That's about four percent more capacity than the S24 FE offered. As a result, any difference in battery life is minimal. I'm sure there are some scenarios the S25 FE may last longer than its predecessor, but in my testing the two phones were equal in terms of longevity. With three to four hours of active screentime, I managed to get a full day of battery life from the S25 FE, with enough power left over to get the phone through the night before charging it in the morning. That's similar to the experience I had last year.</p> 
<p>Speaking of charging, the S24 FE, with a 25 watt wired limit, was painfully slow at it. Going into this review, my hope was the S25 FE would do better and I had good reason to be hopeful. Samsung lists the new phone as capable of charging at 45 watts. However, in my testing the S25 FE was only slightly faster than its predecessor. Plugged into a 130 watt Razer GaN charger, it took the phone about an hour and 14 minutes to charge to full from a battery at 10 percent life. When I replicated that same test with a 25 watt charger, it took the S25 FE just over an hour-and-a-half to charge back up.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Either way, if battery life is important to you, the Nothing 3a Pro and Pixel 9a are better bets. Both come with bigger batteries (5,000 and 5,100mAh, respectively), and with the former, you also get 50 watt charging.</p>

<p>The S25 FE ships with Android 16 and Samsung's One UI 8 out of the box. Samsung has promised to support the phone with at least seven generations of platform updates, so it should stay current with Google's yearly release schedule up until at least Android 23 in 2032. Notably, this means the S25 FE may end up on a more recent version of Android than the S25, S25 Edge and S25 Ultra, all of which released with Android 15.</p> 
<p>With One UI 8, the S25 FE has access to all of the latest AI features from both Samsung and Google. Some of these tools are useful; others replicate functionality that has been present in Android for a long time. For example, Google's Circle to Search is great. It makes it easy to do a visual search of anything on the phone's screen. On the other hand, I could do without Samsung's Now Brief, which offers much of the same utility you'll find on Android's Discover page (a feature that comes standard on every Android phone).</p> 
<p>Each S25 FE also comes with six months of free access to Google AI Pro. Normally priced at $20 per month, the service gives you access to some of the company's best models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, inside of the Gemini app. Within Flow, Google's AI filmmaking app, you also get limited access to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-31-is-better-at-generating-videos-from-images-220829129.html"><ins>Veo 3.1</ins></a>, Google's latest video generation system. Some other perks include 2TB of cloud storage and higher rate limits when using NotebookLM.</p>

<p>With changes that amount to window dressing, I can't recommend anyone buy the S25 FE at full price. There's just enough here to justify spending $650 on a phone that is barely an upgrade over its predecessor. If you're a Samsung fan, I'm sure the S25 FE will be frequently discounted, but why reward the company for a lazy effort? Besides, the S25, following a <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-200-off-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-for-prime-day-100037363.html"><ins>$200 discount for Prime Day</ins></a>, was only $10 more than the FE earlier this month.</p> 
<p>Over the past few years, Google and Nothing have shown midrange phones don't need to be boring, iterative affairs. For Samsung, I think it's time to rethink its FE strategy. If these phones offered something different — say actual fan favorite features like a headphone jack — there could be compelling reasons to recommend them. But as things stand, there's just no reason to buy a new FE phone when the company's flagships see steep price discounts within months of their release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of February, Anthropic <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html">announced Claude Code</a>. In the eight months since then, the coding agent has arguably become the company&#39;s most important product, helping it carve out a niche for itself in the highly competitive AI market. Now, Anthropic is making it easier for developers to use Claude Code in more places with a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!FY8Yx9u0w-2ZTY5kVXnLhRUnDV9G4vi8qwlBBVss1ry8HTqJfks973x-8W-9QYYY0KeSAhrb35mDlHweRlsr$">new web interface</a> for accessing the agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get started, you&#39;ll need connect Claude to your GitHub repositories. From there, the process of using the agent is the same as if it had direct terminal access. Describe what you need from it, and the agent will take it from there. Claude will provide progress updates while it works, and you can even steer it in real-time with additional prompts. Through the web interface, it&#39;s also possible to assign Claude multiple coding tasks to run in parallel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Every Claude Code task runs in an isolated sandbox environment with network and filesystem restrictions. Git interactions are handled through a secure proxy service that ensures Claude can only access authorized repositories — helping keep your code and credentials protected throughout the entire workflow,&quot; said Anthropic.</p>
<p>In addition to making Claude Code available on the web, Anthropic is releasing a preview of the agent inside of its iOS app. The company warns the integration is early, and that it hopes &quot;to quickly refine the mobile experience based on your feedback.&quot;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-the-sims-find-a-new-home-on-ios-and-android.html"><em><ins>The Sims Mobile</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is going away as EA will shut it down on January 20, nearly eight years after its debut in March 2018. An update that went live on Monday is the final one and the company is delisting the game on October 21. Since the game requires online servers (game progress is stored there), it&#39;ll no longer be possible to play <em>The Sims Mobile </em>in three months&#39; time.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The Sims Mobile </em>and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination,&quot; EA said <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a>. &quot;You’ve amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We’re proud to have shared this journey with you, and as a token of our appreciation, we’ve prepared a few surprises as we head into <em>TSM</em>’s final chapter.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>EA will run 14 events, including limited-time quests and treasure hunts, in <em>The Sims Mobile</em> over the next few months. It&#39;s no longer possible to spend any real money in the game, though players can use their existing in-game currency. As of today, players also have unlimited energy, which &quot;should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play,&quot; EA said. On January 6, EA will unlock all of the Build Mode and Create A Sim items so players can fully customize their homes and sims&#39; looks for a couple of weeks before the grim reaper shows up for <em>The Sims Mobile.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2022, EA and Sims studio Maxis <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-sims-5-cross-platform-project-rene-ea-maxis-mobile-freeplay-185822870.html"><ins>announced Project Rene</ins></a>, a game that will run across multiple platforms, including mobile. So it&#39;s maybe not too surprising that the company wants to focus its Sims mobile efforts there.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s a lot to like about NordVPN, as I covered in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN review</a>. It&#39;s one of the fastest among the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a>, and it&#39;s got a bunch of cool, specialized servers for various VPN tasks. But the apps can be frustrating, and beyond that, no VPN is perfect for everyone. If you&#39;ve decided NordVPN isn&#39;t for you, here&#39;s how to cancel your subscription and get your money back.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-off-auto-renewal-on-nordvpn"><strong>How to turn off auto-renewal on NordVPN</strong></h2>
<p>Even though you&#39;ve decided to part ways with NordVPN, you may want to keep your subscription active while you pick out a replacement service. If that&#39;s the case, you can simply cancel automatic renewal and let your subscription expire at the end of the billing period. If you change your mind before then, you can turn auto-renew back on. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ol>
<li><p>Go to my.nordaccount.com. Click <strong>Log in to Nord Account </strong>and enter your email address and password.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll arrive at the account overview page. In the left-hand column, click on <strong>Billing</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the list of subscriptions that appears, find NordVPN. Find the line that says &quot;Auto-renewal: ON,&quot; and click the <strong>Cancel </strong>link next to it.</p></li>
<li><p>A warning message will appear. Click <strong>Cancel auto-renewal </strong>at the bottom-right.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This will turn auto-renewal off. If you decide to turn it back on, just go back to the billing tab of your Nord account overview, find your NordVPN subscription and click <strong>Enable auto-renewal</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-if-you-subscribed-through-an-app-store"><strong>How to cancel if you subscribed through an app store</strong></h3>
<p>If you paid for NordVPN on a mobile device through Google Play or the Apple app store, you&#39;ll need to go to the relevant app store to cancel the subscription. On Android, sign in to Google Play, touch your profile picture, tap <strong>Payments &amp; subscriptions </strong>and tap <strong>Subscriptions.</strong> Scroll until you find NordVPN, tap it and hit <strong>Cancel subscription.</strong> If you want a refund, follow the instructions in &quot;How to get a refund from NordVPN&quot; below.</p>
<p>On iOS, open the settings app, touch your profile picture, then tap <strong>Subscription.</strong> Scroll down to NordVPN, tap it and hit <strong>Cancel subscription</strong>. To get a refund for an Apple purchase, contact the Apple support team instead of the NordVPN team.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-delete-your-nordvpn-account"><strong>How to delete your NordVPN account</strong></h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re sick of NordVPN and already have another VPN lined up, you can cancel immediately by deleting your Nord account altogether. This will also cut you off from any other Nord Security products you might be using, including NordPass and NordLocker.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to my.nordaccount.com, click <strong>Log in to Nord Account</strong> and enter your credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>At the top-right of the account overview page, click your email address. In the dropdown menu, click <strong>Account settings</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the bottom of the page to find the account deletion controls. Click <strong>Delete account.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Nord will send an authentication code to your account&#39;s email address. Enter it.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the onscreen prompts to confirm deletion.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-nordvpn"><strong>How to get a refund from NordVPN</strong></h2>
<p>NordVPN has a standard 30-day money-back guarantee. As long as you bought your subscription in the last 30 days, you can get a full refund. To do so, you&#39;ll need to first cancel auto-renewal on your plan as described above, then contact support to ask for the refund.</p>
<p>You can reach NordVPN support by going to the help center at support.nordvpn.com. To reach the live chat and email ticket options, you&#39;ll need to work your way down to a bottom-level help center article, then scroll down until you reach the section titled &quot;Still having issues?&quot; It&#39;s frustrating, but you can get there by just clicking the first link on every page (or just <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1ddb3ee-c532-422e-ab51-bd46ab294248&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=follow+this+link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxNjQwOTY5Nzg0NDktSS1jYW4tdC1jb25uZWN0LXRvLWEtTm9yZFZQTi1zZXJ2ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImYxZGRiM2VlLWM1MzItNDIyZS1hYjUxLWJkNDZhYjI5NDI0OCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lm5vcmR2cG4uY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTY0MDk2OTc4NDQ5LUktY2FuLXQtY29ubmVjdC10by1hLU5vcmRWUE4tc2VydmVyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQN3YqZSQHtryrjeV1LjDaSWOo-zVTenL1v_t1Mu5LTq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.nordvpn.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F20164096978449-I-can-t-connect-to-a-NordVPN-server" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20164096978449-I-can-t-connect-to-a-NordVPN-server">follow this link</a> and scroll down).</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve found the buttons, either start a live chat or open the email form. Whichever you choose, explain that you&#39;ve cancelled your subscription and would like a refund. Make sure not to end the interaction until you&#39;ve received confirmation that your refund will be processed. Afterwards, it&#39;ll take up to 10 business days for your reimbursement to go through.</p>

<p>To that end, there are now three main and easily identifiable tabs. The &quot;Today&quot; tab includes only the most relevant data to help inform daily decisions. The &quot;Vitals&quot; tab offers &quot;at-a-glance views of core health pillars.&quot; This includes data on sleep, stress and cardiovascular trends. Colors change based on various biometric indicators to offer quick visual cues.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The &quot;My Health&quot; tab is more interested in long-term health, offering cumulative data on a user&#39;s strengths, traits and opportunities for proactive care. This tab also includes a section about habits and routines to link &quot;daily behaviors to measurable outcomes.&quot;</p>
<p>The new Oura app also offers some increased health-tracking capabilities. The previous version of the app included a view that showed a month of data regarding menstrual cycles and fertility window predictions. This has been increased to a full year. Members also now get personalized cycle phase data from a single night of sleep instead of having to wait two months like before.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify just introduced a feature that lets users <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-10-20/live-music-venues-on-spotify/"><ins>follow their favorite concert venues</ins></a>. This will provide people with updates and details about upcoming concerts.</p>
<p>Once a venue is selected as a favorite, it gets saved in a user&#39;s library. Browsing each venue provides information on scheduled concerts, general announcements and other stuff. Folks can even filter upcoming shows by genre. Clicking on a specific spot will also pull up &quot;tailored suggestions for other venues&quot; in the vicinity.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify&#39;s new venue-tracking platform will offer links to each location&#39;s &quot;official ticketing partner&quot; to make it easier to scoop up some tickets. The company says it currently tracks over 20,000 venues throughout the globe, from &quot;iconic arenas to beloved independent clubs.&quot;</p>
<p>Spotify also announced a change to its live event feed. This will now update daily instead of weekly. For the uninitiated, this tool <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-live-events-feed-125033086.html"><ins>tracks when artists are touring</ins></a> and lists nearby live events.</p>
<p>The platform recently added yet another tool for concert discovery in the form of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-latest-custom-playlist-highlights-artists-with-upcoming-shows-in-your-area-150817219.html"><ins>custom playlists that highlight artists</ins></a> with upcoming shows in the area. These playlists update every week and include 30 songs.</p>
<p>These are welcome tools, as artists <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/30/spotify-smaller-artists-wrapped-indie-musicians"><ins>don&#39;t get paid a whole lot</ins></a> from streaming platforms, instead relying on live ticket sales. The features could also help stem some of the bad press that&#39;s been coming Spotify&#39;s way lately, thanks to CEO Daniel Ek&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave"><ins>involvement with a weapons manufacturing company</ins></a> and the platform going running recruitment ads for <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-ads-all-over-streaming-services-spotify-hbo-pandora-1235447970/"><ins>controversial government entities like ICE</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-now-lets-people-follow-venues-to-find-out-about-concerts-153836816.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The ZenBook S14 wowed us with its powerful hardware, excellent battery life (of over 16 hours) and solid construction. It's a sign of how far ASUS has come from simply copying Apple. The S14 is also lighter than the MacBook Air, and it includes more useful ports (two USB-C, one USB-A, HDMI and a headphone jack). Its Ceraluminum case (a unique ceramic material) also feels surprisingly polished, and its OLED screen looks simply amazing.

While we haven't reviewed this specific model, the specs on even the entry-level configuration have all of the power you need for basic computing, despite housing everything in a frame that's notably smaller than older tower PCs. And if you need a bit more performance, consider the slightly more expensive Dell Pro, which can squeeze in up to 32GB of RAM and a handful of dedicated graphics cards.</p>

<p>Apple's Mac mini is one of the most powerful mini-desktops around, it's adorably small and it starts at just $599 (look for the frequent sales that drop the price by as much as $100). Just as I argued above for the MacBook Air, it's worth considering the jump to MacOS simply because Apple's hardware is so impressive now. And don't worry, you can connect any monitor to it, and you won't have to replace your existing PC keyboard and mouse.</p>

<h3 id="a5190240-9e05-4b93-85b2-2a09ad105aab">Do I need to upgrade to a new computer if my current Windows 10 PC still works fine for me?</h3>
<p>Your computer will still continue to run following the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">Microsoft’s termination of default support for Windows 10 on October 15, 2025</a>, but that’s not a wise longterm strategy. The free Extended Security Updates will buy you another year, but that's effectively a limited life support: After that, Windows 10 PCs won’t receive security updates or any sort of improvements, so they’ll be vulnerable to hacking and malware. And if you’ve still got an old Windows 10 machine, there’s a good chance that its components may wear out soon. If you choose to continue using a Windows 10 PC, be sure to back up your important data and try not to rely on it for critical tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="b47244d8-0b05-4ee6-9caf-581b7d54cf36">Can a Mac run native Windows software?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Virtualization software like VMWare and Parallels can let you run Windows apps inside of macOS, but be aware that also involves buying a copy of Windows and dedicating a large chunk of disk space for it. These days, most major apps are available across both platforms, so be sure to check if there’s a Mac version of your favorite Windows app.</p>
<h3 id="61f3555d-78ca-4696-b011-753f90be0af9">Can a Chromebook or iPad replace a Windows 10 PC?</h3>
<p>Chromebooks and iPads both have very specific purposes: Chromebooks are great budget-friendly machines for accessing the web and running online apps. iPads are a handy way to upgrade your mobile internet experiences, since their large screens are better for browsing the web, running apps and watching media. But neither are ideal replacements for a Windows 10 PC, which can access the full breadth of Windows software in addition to the web. If either one works for you, great; but we think the options listed above are better full-service PC replacements.</p>
<h3 id="7887eefa-99f8-421d-a81f-3125d1d90438">I have a ton of PC games. What's my best upgrade option?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to find a decent gaming desktop from a reliable computer maker these days, just make sure you’re equipped with at least 32GB of RAM (new titles can be pretty memory intensive), and an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/how-to-buy-a-gpu-160100017.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">NVIDIA RTX 40-series or AMD Radeon RX 9000-series GPU</a>.</p>
<p>As for CPUs, I’d recommend sticking with Intel’s 13th-gen chips or AMD’s Ryzen 8000-series processors at a minimum. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">Don’t count out gaming laptops</a> either, as they’ve come a long way over the last decade. It’s not hard to find a gaming notebook that’s powerful, portable and useful for multimedia and productivity work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update, October 20 2025, 9:30AM ET: </strong><em>This story has been updated to reflect that the Windows 10 end of support date has now passed, and we’ve included a link to an explainer on how to extend support for another year for free.</em></p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monarch Money is one of our favorite budgeting apps and, fittingly enough, there's a way for newcomers to save money on a subscription right now. If you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=you+can+get+12+months+of+access+for+%2450+with+this+code.&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code.</a></p> 
<p>There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-half-off-annual-subscriptions-to-one-of-our-favorite-budgeting-apps-right-now-174011463.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This is a mighty fine deal, given that Apple TV recently changed both its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-is-now-just-apple-tv-200644609.html">name</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/apple-tv-subscriptions-just-rose-to-13-a-month-150516370.html">price</a>. The platform costs $13 per month now on its own. Peacock starts at $11 per month. In other words, this is a discount of around $9 each month. In this economy, we'll take any savings we can get.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="a7175737134e46319a381c426a2da866" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://tv.apple.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>As mentioned previously, the only caveat is that the base tier includes ads. The subscription shoots up to $20 per month for an ad-free version. However, a standalone subscription to ad-free Peacock is $17 on its own. Additionally, Apple One subscribers will get a 35 percent discount on Peacock Premium Plus plans. It's always nice when two lonely corporations find friendship, isn't it?</p> 
<p>For the uninitiated, Apple TV is the company's big-wig streaming platform. It's primarily known for sci-fi like <em>Severance</em>, <em>For All Mankind</em> and the upcoming <em>Pluribus</em>. The platform is also host to plenty of comedy, like <em>The Studio</em>, <em>Shrinking</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em>.</p> 
<p>Peacock is NBC's streaming service. It streams old-school network programming like <em>The Office</em>, <em>Grimm</em> and <em>Superstore</em>. The service features a stable of original programming like <em>Poker Face</em>, <em>Twisted Metal</em> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html">underrated <em>Mrs. Davis</em></a>. The platform also recently premiered a little show called <em>The Paper</em>, which is a spinoff of <em>The Office</em>. Against all odds, this is actually a great little sitcom and a worthy successor to the original.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beats devices have been the more colorful, full-of-personality complements to Apple’s clean-and-minimal gear ever since Apple bought the company back in 2014. Beats earbuds and speakers are the more flexible alternatives to things like AirPods and HomePods, and the new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-announces-the-powerbeats-fit-a-slightly-updated-successor-to-the-beats-fit-pro-140000905.html">Beats Powerbeats Fit</a> keep that tradition alive. Some six months after the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> debuted earlier this year, Beats now has an updated version of the Fit Pro to offer folks looking for many of the conveniences of an Apple device in something with slightly more character and versatility. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Beats made small changes on the Powerbeats Fit that ultimately make for a more polished version of its predecessor.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-whats-new">What’s new</h2> 
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">Beats Fit Pro</a>, you’ll be familiar with the Powerbeats Fit. Beats kept much of what worked with its previous $200 earbuds here (including the price), making very minor changes to improve the comfort and the overall design. The new buds have 20 percent more flexible wingtips and the charging case is 17 percent more compact than that of the Beats Fit Pro. More on the wingtips in a moment, but first I have to commend Beats for making the charging case feel ever so slightly more premium this time around — and since it’s smaller than before, it’s less cumbersome to tuck in your back pocket. The buds also fit snugly into the charging case with a satisfying <em>snap</em> every time; they always align properly to recharge, something I cannot say about past pairs of the AirPods Pro I’ve owned.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="361222c39aa54b1ea2e4e44ced20bbbb" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Powerbeats-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Compatible/dp/B0FPGQZTFB/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>When it comes to the wingtips on the Powerbeats Fit, they appear to be a hair shorter than those on the Beats Fit Pro, and certainly more malleable. I felt the biggest difference in flexibility at the base of the wingtip where it meets the earbud — those on the Powerbeats Fit have a bit more give than those on its predecessor. These small changes make it easy to pop the Powerbeats Fit into your ears and really not fuss with the wingtips at all. They’re present just to provide a more secure fit during intense workouts, and they do just that.</p> 
<p>I wore them during strength training, 5K runs and leisurely walks and I didn’t have to adjust them at all once I popped them in. When Beats announced these new buds, the company claimed its design tweaks would also make the Powerbeats Fit more comfortable to wear all day long, not just during workouts. I’ll admit that I didn’t find the previous Beats Fit Pro uncomfortable to wear when not at the gym or on the trail. Yes, the Powerbeats Fit are marginally more comfortable now and the wingtips are more supple, but the change is subtle. If you jibe with the wingtip design to begin with, you’ll safely be able to use the Powerbeats Fit as daily drivers in addition to workout companions.</p> 
<p>Notably, the Powerbeats Fit come with one extra pair of eartips in the box (four instead of the previous three), so once you find the eartips that are your best fit, you’ll be off to the races. There are also two new bold colors to choose from, orange and pink, in addition to gray and black.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-whats-the-same">What’s the same</h2> 
<p>Thankfully, Beats didn’t mess with all of the good things about the Fit Pro when developing the Powerbeats Fit. The new buds have an IPX4 water resistance rating, which isn’t the highest level of protection out there, but more than enough to withstand your sweatiest training sessions. Onboard controls in the form of physical buttons remain the same, although I didn’t accidentally trigger the buttons on the Powerbeats Fit nearly as much as I did with the Fit Pro. That might be because all the small changes Beats made in the design paid off — I didn’t fuss with the new buds in my ears as much as before, therefore I didn’t accidentally press the buttons as much.</p> 
<p>The Powerbeats Fit also have Apple’s H1 chip inside, which enables features like hands-free Siri, automatic switching between devices, Adaptive EQ, Audio Sharing and Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking. Transparency mode returns here as well, and it remains one of the standout features of any Apple-associated wireless earbuds. And if you do decide to wear the Powerbeats Fit all day long, you’ll likely make even more use of transparency mode as you need to jump in and out of conversations happening around you. In addition, you can keep track of the new earbuds in Apple’s Find My app.</p> 
<p>Beats didn’t bill any improvements in sound quality on the Powerbeats Fit, and after listening to them alongside the Beats Fit Pro, I can say they sound almost identical. While listening to some tracks with the Powerbeats Fit, I noticed an almost imperceptible increase in the clarity of vocals, but that’s about it. Bass remains punchy and strong, and the buds get decently loud.</p> 
<p>Active noise cancellation (ANC) is also the same on the new buds: strong enough to block out ambient noise around you and people’s voices. While running outside, I still heard the loudest disturbances like passing trucks and oddly sonorous cackling of nearby wildlife, but that’s arguably for the best. If you’re exercising outside, be it in a park or on city streets, you should be at least somewhat aware of your surroundings.</p>

<p>Battery life is consistent here as well, with Beats promising up to seven hours on a single charge (or six with ANC turned on) and up to 30 hours total when employing the Powerbeats Fit charging case. Anecdotally, after a week of using the Powerbeats Fit for an average of one hour each day, the charging case still had 75 percent battery left. If you’re using these all day, every day, you’ll obviously need to power it up more frequently.

But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be.

If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html">foldables</a> — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.<br><br>At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years.

<h2 id="jump-link-other-smartphones-weve-tested">Other smartphones we've tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-iphone-air">iPhone Air</h3> 
<p>At just 5.6mm, the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air</a> is the thinnest iPhone ever made. But it’s so much more than that. It’s beautifully crafted and thanks to a titanium frame, Ceramic Shield 2 screen and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, it’s surprisingly durable too. The Air also has a gorgeous 6.5-inch display with ProMotion support and an A19 Pro processor, so it delivers nearly the same performance as you get from the iPhone 17 Pro line. And despite its super thin chassis not leaving a ton of room for a big power cell, battery life isn’t an issue. In short, this is the iPhone design that everyone wants. However, with the Air only having a single rear camera, the question you need to answer is if you’re willing to give up some extra lenses to get the most exquisitely engineered iPhone and all of its style and sleekness. <em>— S.R.</em></p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h3> 
<p>While the design and performance of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is so good that we had to pick it as our favorite foldable of this generation, the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-tankiest-foldable-170051471.html">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> isn’t that far behind. Sure, it’s bigger and bulkier, but it still has the best cameras on any foldable phone along with better software and a larger battery. But perhaps most importantly, it now has a proper IP68 rating for dust and water resistance — something you won’t find on any of its rivals. This could save the phone from an early demise and prevent a lot of headaches if you frequent the beach or pretty much anywhere with little particles that could threaten the insides of your device. <em>— S.R.</em></p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</h3> 
<p>While the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html">OnePlus 13</a> features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.</p> 
<p>OnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smartphone">What to look for in a smartphone</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-android-or-ios">Android or iOS?</h3> 
<p>When you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms.</p> 
<p>As for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cameras">Cameras</h3> 
<p>Since your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html">Mid-range phones</a> often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-will-you-get-mmwave-5g-or-wi-fi-7">Will you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?</h3> 
<p>The good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.</p> 
<p>On the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/linksys-releases-its-first-ever-wi-fi-7-mesh-router-system-160053926.html">compatible router</a>, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-other-features-to-consider">Other features to consider</h3> 
<p>Because not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 17 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-smartphone-faqs">Smartphone FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-know-which-smartphone-is-the-best-for-me">How do I know which smartphone is the best for me?</h3> 
<p>While choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-is-a-smartphone">How much is a smartphone?</h3> 
<p>Smartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-can-you-do-on-a-smartphone">What can you do on a smartphone?</h3> 
<p>Smartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-smartphones-last">How long do smartphones last?</h3> 
<p>Smartphones can last years and people are <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252524995/Smartphone-trade-value-rises-as-average-age-of-devices-breaks-35-year-threshold">holding on to their phones</a> longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Links have proven to be a tricky thing when it comes to social media engagement. On platforms like Threads, data suggests that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-users-still-barely-click-links-170139103.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">people often don&#39;t click the links</a> in posts, and creators on X have complained that posts including links don&#39;t get as much visibility. X is now trying to solve that. Head of product Nikita Bier <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1979994223224209709" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shared</a> that the platform is &quot;testing a new link experience&quot; that lets people open a link without leaving the original post entirely, so they can still view the Like, Repost and other buttons. The test is rolling out to iOS users first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re testing a new link experience, starting on iOS -- to make it easier for your followers to engage with your post while browsing links.<br><br>For creators, a common complaint is that posts with links tend to get lower reach.

</div><p>&quot;To help get better signal, posts will now collapse to the bottom of the page so people can react while you&#39;re reading,&quot; Bier wrote alongside a screen recording of how it will work. As to why posts with links typically don&#39;t perform as well, Bier said, &quot;This is because the web browser covers the post and people forget to Like or Reply. So X doesn&#39;t get a clear signal whether the content is any good.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, X has been accused of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-slowing-down-links-to-websites-elon-musk-has-publicly-feuded-with-185544463.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">throttling links to</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-temporarily-blocked-users-from-sharing-links-to-signal-170642960.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">specific sites</a>, and Elon Musk has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">said</a> in the past that links &quot;don&#39;t get as much attention&quot; on the platform, so tweaking the popups will only go so far in addressing the reach issue. Bier added that posts should always &quot;stand alone as great content so write a solid caption.&quot;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/x-is-testing-a-new-way-of-opening-links-in-posts-to-improve-engagement-211210520.html?src=rss]]></description>

As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-accuses-us-cyber-breaches-national-time-centre-2025-10-19/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the Chinese agency posted on WeChat that the NSA targeted the country&#39;s National Time Service Center. As part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the center is tasked with generating, maintaining and transmitting its national standard of time, which is provided to important sectors across the country, including communications, defense and finance.</p>
<p>The state ministry said the operation used around 42 types of &quot;special cyberattack weapons&quot; to infiltrate the National Time Service Center which could have led to the disruption of network communications, financial systems and power supply. The WeChat post also claimed that the NSA exploited vulnerabilities in a foreign mobile phone brand&#39;s messaging system to steal sensitive info from staff devices, without naming the brand.</p>

In addition to adding a new mountain area with two new dungeons, <em>Woolhaven</em> will introduce ranching, so you can raise animals — the regular, <em>non</em>-anthropomorphic kind — to keep as pets, shear for wool or slaughter for meat (you know, if you have no heart).</p><p>Based on the overview video, we&#39;ll get to raise cows(ish), goats and sheep as well as some more unexpected critters like crabs, snails, spiders and turtles. I, personally, am very excited about the snails. You&#39;ll be able to form bonds with and name the animals, and you&#39;ll have to tend to their wellbeing, feeding them healthy foods and cleaning them. Followers will also be able to bond with the animals and have their own pets. As wholesome as that all sounds, this is <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> we&#39;re talking about, so I&#39;m already bracing myself for the inevitable heartbreak of when some unruly follower kills my favorite animals at some point. The video notes that you&#39;ll have to keep them safe from predators.</p><p><em>Woolhaven</em> will be a paid expansion, but we don&#39;t know yet how much it will cost or when exactly it drops.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-14-mortal-kombat-x-the-comedy-of-violence.html">Violent video games</a> have found themselves in the crosshairs of politicians yet again, but this time with Mexico&#39;s government. Earlier this week, Mexico&#39;s Chamber of Deputies approved a comprehensive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/work/models/Finanzas_Publicas/docs/paquete_economico/cgpe/cgpe_2026.pdf">financial package</a> that includes an eight percent tax on video games with mature content. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/mexico-moves-closer-to-putting-a-tax-on-violent-video-games/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, the proposed tax covers games that have a C or D rating under Mexico&#39;s video game age classification system, which is similar to ESRB in the US. The C rating is for players who are at least 18 years old and allows for extreme violence, bloodshed and moderate graphic sexual content, while the D rating is reserved for adults only and allows for prolonged scenes that include similar content.</p>
<p>The proposed law was first introduced in September, when the country&#39;s Treasury Department claimed that &quot;recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.&quot; The report cited a study from 2012 in a footnote, which also observed some positive associations with video games, including motor learning and building resilience.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The current interpretation of the proposal that&#39;s been approved by the Chamber of Deputies would apply to digital and physical copies of affected games, as well as any in-game purchases or microtransactions. The proposal still has to go through Mexico&#39;s other congressional chamber, the Senate, where it will be debated before a November 15 deadline to submit a budget proposal.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mexico-is-considering-slapping-an-eight-percent-tax-on-violent-video-games-184101628.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nearly four years after the release of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-preview-xbox-series-x-080130895.html"><em>Halo: Infinite</em></a>, the sixth installment in the franchise has failed to live up to its name. Instead, the studio behind the sci-fi series may be working on a &quot;live service, long-term updating multiplayer&quot; Halo game that could do just that. According to YouTuber <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E">Rebs Gaming</a>, a source claimed that Halo Studios, previously known as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-itself-to-halo-studios-120041943.html">343 Industries</a>, is working on a multiplayer Halo title that could borrow <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s model of constantly pushing out content updates. The report also noted that there aren&#39;t any mentions of <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s battle royale style for the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While live service games are becoming the norm, veterans of the Halo franchise may not have much faith in Halo Studios after failing to deliver on <em>Halo: Infinite</em>&#39;s longevity. Back in March, another <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twistedvoxel.com/halo-infinite-scrapped-10-year-content-plan-revealed/">report</a> revealed that <em>Halo: Infinite</em> was meant to be supported with a 10-year plan of consistent updates, but this roadmap was scrapped following leadership issues and a switch to Unreal Engine. While <em>Halo: Infinite</em>&#39;s multiplayer mode has received notable updates since its initial release, the game still sits at a Mixed rating on Steam.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with this upcoming live service Halo title, the report claimed that the studio is working on a remake of the first game in the series, <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Unyshek/status/1978966083252937164">John Junyszek</a>, the senior community manager at Halo Studios, we could hear more about either project during the Halo World Championship that takes place from October 24 to 26.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-next-game-in-the-halo-franchise-could-be-live-service-multiplayer-171036206.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Techtober is a busy time for our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/" data-i13n="slk:reviews;cpos:1;pos:1">reviews</a> team as a deluge of new devices arrive before the holiday season. We’ve been hard at work conducting our in-depth testing, but it’s understandable if you missed a review or two over the last few weeks. Read on to catch up all the reviews you might’ve missed, including the latest trio of Google Pixel devices.</p>
<h2 id="d75a7c61-4119-4539-abd9-71f49724214e">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a</h2>
<p>

<p>Earlier this month, a trio of new Pixel devices arrived for us to put through their paces. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold headlines the group, but the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-review-a-well-rounded-smartwatch-with-a-surprising-advantage-170059851.html" data-i13n="slk:Pixel Watch 4;cpos:2;pos:1">Pixel Watch 4</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/google-pixel-buds-2a-review-affordable-earbuds-that-are-better-with-anc-170052705.html" data-i13n="slk:Pixel Buds 2a;cpos:3;pos:1">Pixel Buds 2a</a> are also highly capable devices in their own categories. Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford wrote that Google has removed one of the last remaining issues with foldable phones: durability. “The addition of proper dust and water resistance on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has removed one of the last two shortcomings of modern foldables, which is no mean feat,” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-tankiest-foldable-170051471.html" data-i13n="slk:he said;cpos:4;pos:1">he said</a>. However, at $1,799, the price barrier is still hard to overcome for most folks.”</p>
<h2 id="55c5cdd8-bd5f-4997-a0bc-51afa10a3abf">Meta Ray-Ban Display</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="99aa747f-4c24-4ea5-8ffc-f4f7af46e3b2" data-original-url="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-and-neural-band/"></core-commerce></p>
<p>The second-gen Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses may be the best option for most people right now, but the Meta Ray-Ban Display is the more exciting product for many. If you can get past the chunky look and in-progress features, you still have to contend with limited availability and a $800 price tag. “The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, on the other hand, still look very much like a first-gen product,” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="slk:senior reporter Karissa Bell wrote;cpos:5;pos:1">senior reporter Karissa Bell wrote</a>. “There are some really compelling use cases for the display, but its functionality is limited.”</p>
<h2 id="054ed9c3-366a-43be-b009-a49f65d5015f">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="5f2b5496-8ac9-464f-81e5-f66652668f61" data-original-url="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus/learn-about-rog-ally/pcmcat1678398541884.c?id=pcmcat1678398541884"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Microsoft’s collaboration with ASUS has produced a compelling gaming handheld that’s decidedly Xbox. The combination of familiar controls and a full-screen Xbox experience give this device an advantage over its Windows-based competition. “While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements,” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html" data-i13n="slk:Sam said;cpos:6;pos:1">Sam said</a>. “The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here.”</p>
<h2 id="8981a7b7-2e98-4723-af3a-4ec706a9fc86">Bose QuietComfort Headphones (2nd gen)</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="0cea2e41-ac38-4121-815c-ad1dacdf38dd" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0FDKR293G"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Bose never leave the top few spots on our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html" data-i13n="slk:best noise canceling headphones;cpos:7;pos:1">best noise canceling headphones</a> list, but its refresh of the QC Ultra Headphones put the company firmly back in first place. Updates to active noise cancellation, sound performance, battery life and power management are enough to recommend this model over the previous version and the Sony WH-1000XM6. “Similar to the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds over the summer, Bose didn’t make huge upgrades for the updated version of the QC Ultra Headphones,” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review-impactful-upgrades-to-a-familiar-formula-150000709.html" data-i13n="slk:I explained;cpos:8;pos:1">I explained</a>. “But what you do get here is a decent improvement over its predecessor.”</p>
<h2 id="54bce20c-c32b-4097-abc9-330293243503">Razer Blade 18 (2025)</h2>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="4268516e-31eb-471a-a5bc-a6d74ec877e6" data-original-url="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-18/RZ09-05297ER3-R3U1"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Razer’s massive 18-inch gaming laptop has impressive performance, but it’s size and limited battery life don’t offer a lot of convenience. “Personally, if I had to choose between Razer’s current lineup, I’d go with the Blade 16 so that I could actually carry it around and occasionally use it as a productivity machine,” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-blade-18-2025-review-an-18-inch-gaming-laptop-that-does-the-most-153000136.html" data-i13n="slk:senior reviews editor Devindra Hardawar wrote;cpos:9;pos:1">senior reviews editor Devindra Hardawar wrote</a>. “Not so with the Blade 18 — its short two hour and 17 minute battery life (in PCMark 10’s battery benchmark) means you’ll always need to lug around its beefy power adapter.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-new-pixel-devices-meta-ray-ban-display-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-and-more-130000215.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been 40 years to the day since the Nintendo Entertainment System made its US debut, and to celebrate, gaming accessory maker 8BitDo has unveiled a line of NES-themed products. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary/"><ins>NES40 collection</ins></a> includes a limited edition version of the company's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/"><ins>Ultimate 2 controller</ins></a> that comes with an NES Retro Receiver, so it can be used with the classic console. There's also the NES-inspired <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/"><ins>Retro Cube 2</ins></a> speaker and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/"><ins>Retro 68 Keyboard</ins></a>, the latter of which sports a full aluminum alloy build and an eye-watering $500 price tag. All are available for pre-order now.</p> 
<p>The Ultimate 2 controller is one of our favorite controllers <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-070011952.html"><ins>for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</ins></a>, and the NES40 version comes with all the same features, including TMR joysticks, Hall Effect triggers with mode switching and lots of customization options. But with this one, you also get the NES Retro Receiver (a transparent black version that's exclusive to this drop), four custom joystick caps and a robot keychain that pays homage to Nintendo's R.O.B. toy robot. The controller set costs $80 and will ship November 18. It's compatible with Switch 1, 2 and Windows, as well as the original NES using the receiver accessory.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The Retro 68 Keyboard is 8BitDo's first 68-key keyboard, and it's made entirely of aluminum alloy. That includes the shell, keycaps and buttons, according to the company. It uses Kailh Box Ice Cream Pro Max switches. The keyboard features the NES colorway (like its similar, much less expensive <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/8bitdos-nintendo-inspired-mechanical-keyboard-has-super-buttons-just-begging-to-be-mashed-150024778.html"><ins>Retro Mechanical Keyboard</ins></a>) and comes with programmable wireless dual Super Buttons. 8BitDo says it gets up to 300 usage hours on a charge thanks to its 6500mAh battery. It's compatible with Windows and Android, and is expected to ship in January 2026.</p>

<p>The Retro Cube 2 speaker isn't just a cosmetic update to the original Cube Speaker, but brings some improvements in battery life and functionality too. The dual-speaker system has three connection modes — Bluetooth, 2.4G wireless and wired USB — and comes with a charging dock. It has a 2000mAh battery that gets up to 30 hours of use between charges. Like the earlier version, it has D-pad controls for volume, playback and pairing. The $50 speaker ships on December 12.</p>

Amazon is working with Energy Northwest, Washington state&#39;s utilities agency, and X-energy, an SMR developer, to build the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility.</p>
<p>The SMR has a smaller footprint than traditional nuclear reactors, but will still offer a modular design that can pump out up to 960 megawatts of power. Amazon is planning to help develop four SMRs in the first phase of the Cascade facility that will provide an initial power capacity of 320 megawatts. After that, the facility has the option to expand to 12 units for the maximum energy output. According to Amazon, construction on the project will start sometime before the end of the decade, while operations are expected to start in the 2030s.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Texas could have a serious legal battle on its hands thanks to an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-enacts-age-verification-law-for-app-stores-190603522.html">age verification law</a> for app stores that it recently enacted. In response to the Texas App Store Accountability Act, the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) filed a lawsuit that argues the new order goes against First Amendment rights. The not-for-profit trade association has Amazon, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-explains-how-it-will-comply-with-app-store-age-verification-requirements-in-texas-185934469.html">Apple</a> and Google amongst its members.</p>
<p>The law goes into effect on New Year&#39;s Day and requires app store users to verify their age before downloading apps or making in-app purchases. If underage, users have to get parental consent each time they want to download an app or make another in-app purchase. Along with those stipulations, the suit claims that there&#39;s an additional burden on developers, who have to &quot;age-rate&quot; their apps for different age groups.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This Texas law violates the First Amendment by restricting app stores from offering lawful content, preventing users from seeing that content, and compelling app developers to speak of their offerings in a way pleasing to the state,&quot; Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president and chief of staff for the CCIA, said in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ccianet.org/news/2025/10/ccia-sues-texas-to-block-unconstitutional-app-store-law/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Along with CCIA, a student advocacy group called Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT) filed a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.dwt.com/about/news/2025/10/dwt-files-1a-challenge-to-texas-app-store-law">similar lawsuit</a> objecting to Texas&#39; upcoming app store requirements. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, the firm representing SEAT and the two high school students named in the lawsuit, said the law &quot;violates the First Amendment by imposing sweeping restrictions on access to protected speech and information.&quot; The law firm also noted the potential dangers associated with collecting <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/us-employee-screening-firm-disa-hit-with-data-breach-affecting-over-33-million-people-145658681.html">personal information</a>, like government IDs, when it comes to verifying identity.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-hit-with-a-pair-of-lawsuits-for-its-app-store-age-verification-requirements-164940290.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>US District Judge Phyllis Hamilton has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://courthousenews.com/israeli-spyware-company-blocked-from-whatsapp/">reduced</a> the damages Meta is getting from the NSO Group from $167 million to $4 million, but she has also ordered the Israeli spyware maker to stop targeting WhatsApp. If you&#39;ll recall, Meta <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-sues-nso-group.html">sued the NSO Group</a> in 2019 over its Pegasus spyware, which it said was used to spy on 1,400 people from 20 countries, including journalists and human rights activists. Meta said at the time that Pegasus can infect targets&#39; devices even without their participation by sending text messages with malicious codes to WhatsApp. Even a missed call is enough to infect somebody&#39;s device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://courthousenews.com/israeli-spyware-company-blocked-from-whatsapp/"><em>Courthouse News Service</em></a>, Hamilton reduced the damages because they would need to follow a legal framework designed to proportionate damages. However, she has also handed down a permanent injunction on the NSO Group&#39;s efforts to break into WhatsApp. In her decision, she took note of statements made by NSO&#39;s lawyers and its own CEO revealing that it hasn&#39;t stopped collecting WhatsApp messages and trying to get around the messaging app&#39;s security measures. The defendants previously said that the injunction Meta was requesting would &quot;put NSO’s entire enterprise at risk&quot; and &quot;force NSO out of business,&quot; since WhatsApp is one of the Pegasus spyware&#39;s main ways to infect targets&#39; devices.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Today’s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again,&quot; said Will Cathcart, Head of WhatsApp. &quot;We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hamilton wrote that the proposed injunction requires the Israeli company to delete and destroy computer code related to Meta&#39;s platforms, and that she concluded that the provision is &quot;necessary to prevent future violations, especially given the undetectable nature of defendants’ technology.&quot; It&#39;s not quite clear how Meta will ensure that the NSO Group doesn&#39;t use WhatsApp to infect its users&#39; devices again.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-22-google-proposes-privacy-sandbox.html">Privacy Sandbox</a> is officially dead. In an update on the project&#39;s website, Google Vice President Anthony Chavez has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/">announced</a> that the company was sunsetting the remaining technologies developed for Sandbox due to their &quot;low levels of adoption.&quot; A spokesperson has confirmed to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.adweek.com/media/googles-privacy-sandbox-is-officially-dead/"><em>AdWeek</em></a> that Google isn&#39;t just killing those technologies, it&#39;s retiring the whole initiative altogether. &quot;We will be continuing our work to improve privacy across Chrome, Android and the web, but moving away from the Privacy Sandbox branding,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;We&#39;re grateful to everyone who contributed to this initiative, and will continue to collaborate with the industry to develop and advance platform technologies that help support a healthy and thriving web.&quot;</p>
<p>The company <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-22-google-proposes-privacy-sandbox.html">launched</a> Privacy Sandbox in 2019 as a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-14-google-chrome-third-party-cookies.html">future replacement</a> to third-party cookies. It&#39;s a set of open standards that are supposed to enable personalized ads without divulging identifying data. Over the years, Google&#39;s plans to deprecate third-party cookies got pushed back again and again due to a series of delays and regulatory hurdles. Specifically, both the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the US Department of Justice looked into the Privacy Sandbox out of concerns that it could harm smaller advertisers.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 2024, Google ultimately decided <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-isnt-killing-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-after-all-202031863.html">not to kill third-party cookies</a> in Chrome and instead chose to roll out &quot;a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing.&quot; Just this April, Google announced that it <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-keep-third-party-tracking-cookies-on-chrome-as-they-are-130026362.html">wasn&#39;t going to make any to changes</a> to how third-party cookies work on the Chrome browser at all, and that it was going to &quot;maintain [its] current approach to offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome.&quot; At the time, the company said that it was going to keep the Privacy Sandbox initiative alive, but things have clearly changed since then. Chavez wrote in the latest update that Google will &quot;continue to utilize learnings from the retired Privacy Sandbox technologies.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-has-killed-privacy-sandbox-130029899.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. I&#39;ve reluctantly paused <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Ball x Pit</em></a> for long enough to share some neat new releases and more details on upcoming games — some of which are arriving very soon. We&#39;ve got a notable update for a classic as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Steam Next Fest is taking place at the minute, and you still have until Monday to join in by checking out some of the many, many demos that have gone live for the event. Thanks partially (okay, almost entirely) to being unable to escape <em>Ball x Pit</em>, I&#39;ve only tried a fewm Next Fest demos so far.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOA768Gmlpo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;m a fan of <em>Aerial_Knight&#39;s Never Yield </em>and after last year&#39;s sequel, it&#39;s cool to see solo developer Neil Jones (aka Aerial_Knight) trying something totally different. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3987530/Aerial_Knights_DropShot_Demo/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em></a> is a skydiving first-person shooter with finger guns and dragons. It’s a single-player game in which the aim is to take out your opponents and reach the ground first. Like Jones&#39; previous games, it&#39;s stylish and fast-paced. I&#39;m planning to check out the full game when it arrives down the line.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XaY8TEaiJg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It certainly helps to be a fast, accurate typer when you put words together for a living, but I wasn&#39;t quick or precise enough to win any rounds in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Final Sentence </em>demo</a>. This is a battle royale for up to 100 players in which you&#39;re at a typewriter and have to bash out sentences (or other strings of letters, numbers and symbols) in a race to the finish. If you run out of time, make too many mistakes or don&#39;t win, it&#39;s lights out, courtesy of the masked figure with a revolver who’s standing in front of you.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some nice touches here. Having to type out the rules in the first few rounds is a clever idea on the part of developer Button Mash. I haven&#39;t won a round myself yet (I finished in second place a couple of times), but watched some streamers play. It&#39;s very funny when the winning player flips the bird at the guy holding a revolver in front of them. </p><p><em>Final Sentence</em> is coming to Steam later this year. Maybe I&#39;ll have learned how to spell &quot;sphinx&quot; by then.</p><p>There are a few other Next Fest demos I&#39;d like to try this weekend, namely:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Crashout Crew</em></a><em> </em>(<em>Overcooked</em>-style <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/crashout-crew-looks-like-overcooked-style-mayhem-from-one-of-the-studios-behind-peak-193854718.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">co-op chaos with forklifts</a>)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129530/REANIMAL/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Reanimal</em></a><em> </em>(<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/reanimal-promises-a-more-terrifying-journey-than-little-nightmares-200457474.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">co-op horror</a> from the team behind <em>Little Nightmares </em>and <em>Little Nightmares 2</em>)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3631290/Slots__Daggers/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1"><em>Slots &amp; Daggers</em></a><em> </em>(as if I need <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-2-slot-machine-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000884.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">another slot-machine-based roguelite</a> in my life right now)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1"><em>The Last Caretaker</em></a><em> </em>(sci-fi survival)</p></li><li><p><em>Goodnight Universe </em>(we&#39;ll get to that)</p></li></ul><p>I&#39;ve been looking forward to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1"><em>Skate Story</em></a><em> </em>for forever, but I think I&#39;m going to skip that demo.

I love when you get to play a game as a weird little guy. The game of the same name is a spooky NES homebrew platformer from Calgames.&nbsp;</p><p>Mister Scary can stomp on his enemies, or freeze or burn them after eating a snack. When Mister Scary ducks, he becomes immune to damage because he&#39;s taking a nap. I appreciate that. Nothing scary can happen while you&#39;re snoozing.</p><p><em>Mister Scary </em>is $10 on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://calgames.itch.io/mister-scary" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">Itch</a>.

I&#39;ve been playing that classic freeware platformer for a long time, and now there&#39;s a good reason for many people to revisit the third entry in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>As a thank you to the <em>N++ </em>community, Metanet Software is releasing a free update to mark the 10th anniversary of the game&#39;s PS4 debut. TEN++ is said to include the developer&#39;s &quot;most challenging levels yet.&quot; Given how darn tough these games are already, that&#39;s saying something. The update is available now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">Steam</a> and it&#39;s coming to the console versions of <em>N++ </em>soon.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9b3YBcTFt8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>The Cabin Factory </em>is an anomaly-hunting (i.e. spot the difference) game in the style of <em>The Exit 8</em>. You&#39;ll examine horror-themed cabins that are built for use in movies and theme parks to make sure they aren&#39;t actually haunted. If you spot an anomaly, you&#39;ll want to get out of the cabin post haste.</p><p>This $3 horror walking sim from International Cat Studios and publisher Future Friends Games debuted on Steam last year, and it just hit consoles in time for Halloween.

Alas, the latest game from the legendary Ron Gilbert now has a release date, and it&#39;s very soon!</p><p>In <em>Death by Scrolling</em>, the aim is to collect enough gold to pay a ferryman so you can escape purgatory. However, there&#39;s a wall of fire coming after you the whole time, so you&#39;ll need to keep moving in order to try to stay alive. You&#39;ll also need to avoid or stun an unkillable grim reaper as you collect gold and gems that unlock upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Death by Scrolling </em>is from Gilbert&#39;s Terrible Toybox and MicroProse Software. It&#39;s coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_by_Scrolling/" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">Steam</a> on October 28.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxO69IGZMpE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There&#39;s a lot going on in <em>Silly Polly Beast</em>. It&#39;s safe to say this game is a shooter, but the release date trailer rapidly flits between perspectives and genres. There&#39;s an emphasis on survival horror, along with puzzles and stealth segments. Polly will even sometimes remove the board that&#39;s strapped to her back for some skateboarding sequences.&nbsp;</p><p>This is said to have a story that morphs and evolves as much as the gameplay does. After escaping her hellish orphanage, Polly lands right in the underworld and has to navigate her way out of that too.&nbsp;</p><p>Developer Andrei Chernyshov and publisher Top Hat Studios are behind <em>Silly Polly Beast.</em> It&#39;s coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598780/Silly_Polly_Beast/" data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016634/" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">PS4, PS5</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2be25d7-2136-4bcb-aa14-9857837a590a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;linkText=Xbox+One%2C+Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9zaWxseS1wb2xseS1iZWFzdC85UDlENlIyNUM0N1YiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyYmUyNWQ3LTIxMzYtNGJjYi1hYTE0LTk4NTc4MzdhNTkwYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvc2lsbHktcG9sbHktYmVhc3QvOVA5RDZSMjVDNDdWIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAap-UkzTgOFbVYj9w-hysWYaWbK8NKx4Qag8yDtd0MJK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fsilly-polly-beast%2F9P9D6R25C47V" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:;cpos:26;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silly-polly-beast/9P9D6R25C47V">Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</a> and Nintendo Switch on October 28.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MpivAiqGbFY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3309750/As_Long_As_Youre_Here/" data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1">coming to Steam</a> on October 28 is a project from Autoscopia Interactive that&#39;s designed to be played in a single sitting. <em>As Long As You’re Here</em> is a first-person game that places you in the role of a woman with Alzheimer’s disease. Her memories of the past, including her late brother, blend into the present as Annie settles into living with her family.&nbsp;</p><p><em>As Long As You’re Here</em> started as a student project by Marlène Delrive, who was trying to better understand what her grandmother was experiencing in her final years. &quot;The aim is to create a mature and nuanced experience that shows the difficult repercussions of losing not only your memory, but also your agency and sense of time and place,&quot; the developers said.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMf3zJH3k_Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Let&#39;s close things out with a new trailer for <em>Goodnight Universe</em>. This is a cinematic adventure in which you play as a six-month-old baby. This particular infant is incredibly intelligent and has psychic powers. Isaac simply desires familial love and acceptance but (shock horror!) a tech company wants to take away the tot.</p><p>As with Nice Dreams&#39; last game (the stupendous <em>Before Your Eyes</em>), you control <em>Goodnight Universe </em>with your peepers via your device&#39;s camera. It seems fascinating, and I really have to check out the Next Fest demo.

It&#39;s an opt-in feature, but the company may train its models on your media if you use its AI editing or share the results.</p>
<p>From a user experience perspective, the idea is to help you find &quot;hidden gems&quot; in your library and turn them into something shareable. After scanning your photo library (with your permission), it will cough up suggestions. For example, it might recommend a collage based on a vacation, a recap of a graduation party or simply spruce up some photos with AI. For better or worse, it&#39;s another step in the direction of automating creativity and skill.</p>

<p>Zooming out to Meta&#39;s business motives, it&#39;s easy to imagine this is a move for more AI training data. The company says it won&#39;t train its AI on your camera roll &quot;unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share.&quot; If you find it useful enough to use, your media may help train Meta&#39;s AI models.</p>
<p>The company says the feature&#39;s suggestions are private to you until you choose to share them. Its permissions state, &quot;To create ideas for you, we&#39;ll select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis, based on info like time, location or themes.&quot; However, Meta says your media won&#39;t be used for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&#39;s opt-in, so you can safely ignore this altogether without privacy worries. If you grant it permission, you&#39;ll see its suggestions (visible only to you) in Stories and Feed. And should you activate it but change your mind later, you can turn it back off through Facebook&#39;s camera roll settings.</p>
<p>The feature is available now in the US and Canada. Meta says it will soon begin testing it in other countries.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/facebooks-latest-ai-feature-can-scan-your-phones-camera-roll-200056906.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s Ring brand is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-expands-community-requests-to-additional-community-safety-partners/" data-i13n="slk:entering into a new partnership;cpos:1;pos:1">entering into a new partnership</a> with surveillance company Flock Safety to make it possible for law enforcement to request footage from smart doorbell owners. The move is part of a pivot back to collaborating with police, after Ring spent several years distancing itself and its products from law enforcement agencies.</p><p>As part of the partnership, &quot;public safety agencies&quot; using Flock&#39;s Nova platform or FlockOS will be able to use Ring&#39;s previously announced &quot;Community Requests&quot; program to receive footage captured by the camera of a Ring customer. Agencies investigating an event that might have been captured on camera will have to provide details like the &quot;specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated&quot; before the request is passed on to relevant users. Throughout the process, the identity of Ring users is kept anonymous, as is whether they agree to share footage. The entire process is also entirely optional.</p><p>Amazon and Ring&#39;s approach to working with law enforcement has varied over the years. While Ring reportedly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-is-reportedly-walking-back-its-police-friendly-stance-on-data-sharing-191514423.html" data-i13n="slk:removed the ability;cpos:2;pos:1">removed the ability</a> for police to make warrantless video requests in 2024, there were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-law-enforcement-disclosure-224557384.html" data-i13n="slk:documented cases;cpos:3;pos:1">documented cases</a> of the company providing access to law enforcement in years prior. This pivot back towards a more police-friendly stance might have been prompted by Ring founder Jamie Siminoff <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ring-founder-jamie-siminoff-is-back-at-amazon-to-run-its-video-doorbell-unit-130009731.html" data-i13n="slk:returning to the Amazon-subsidiary;cpos:4;pos:1">returning to the Amazon-subsidiary</a> in April 2025. Now Amazon is reportedly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-is-reportedly-aggressively-pitching-law-enforcement-on-its-cloud-services-215334082.html" data-i13n="slk:pitching its cloud and AI services;cpos:5;pos:1">pitching its cloud and AI services</a> to law enforcement agencies and Ring is looking to work with Flock and other surveillance companies.</p><p>That might not bother the average Ring customer who already planned to opt out of sharing, but there&#39;s reasons to be concerned that Amazon is budding up with Flock. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/" data-i13n="slk:404 Media reports;cpos:6;pos:1"><em>404 Media </em>reports</a> the company&#39;s surveillance tools have been used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to find and detain people, without a formal contract. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/" data-i13n="slk:Navy and Secret Service employees;cpos:7;pos:1">Navy and Secret Service employees</a> also reportedly had access to Flock&#39;s network. That doesn&#39;t implicate Ring in anything, but it does make the connection between the two camera networks feel more fraught.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/rings-latest-partnership-allows-police-to-access-camera-footage-through-flock-194609879.html?src=rss]]></description>

On one hand, I'm still not entirely comfortable with how they look. I've worn them on the bus, at the office, on walks around my neighborhood and during hangouts with friends. Each time, I'm very aware that I probably look a bit strange.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's a lot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html" data-i13n="slk:I really like;cpos:2;pos:1">I really like</a> about using these glasses. The built-in display has helped me look at my phone less throughout the day. The neural band feels more innovative than any wrist-based device I've tried. Together, it feels like a significant milestone for smart glasses overall. But it's also very much a first-generation device with some issues that still need to be worked out.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="9237af4f-de93-4f23-91eb-0dc04ed4494a">Chunky statement glasses or hideously nerdy?</h2>
<p>To once again state the obvious: The frames are extremely chunky and too wide for my face. The dark black frames I tried for this review unfortunately accentuate the extra thickness. I won't pretend it's my best look and I did feel a bit self-conscious at times wearing these in public. Meta also makes a light brown "sand" color that I tried at the Connect event, and I think that color is a bit more flattering, even if the frames are just as oversized. (Sidenote: Smart glasses companies, please, please make your frames available in something other than black!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, everyone has a different face shape, skin tone and general ability to "pull off" what one of my friends charitably described as "chunky statement glasses." What looks not-great on my face, may look good on someone else. I really wish Meta could have squeezed this tech into slightly smaller frames, but I did get more used to the look the more I wore them. Overall, I do think the size is a reasonable tradeoff for a first-generation product that's pretty clearly aimed at early adopters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason the glasses are so thick compared with Meta's other frames is because there are a lot of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/ifixit-calls-metas-ray-ban-display-glasses-unrepairable-but-praises-the-tech-154820301.html" data-i13n="slk:extra components;cpos:3;pos:1">extra components</a> to power the display, including a mini projector and waveguide. And, at 69 grams, the display glasses are noticeably heavier. I didn't find it particularly uncomfortable at first, but there is a noticeable pressure after six or seven hours of wear. Plus, the extra weight and width also made them consistently slide down my nose. I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable wearing these on a bike ride or a jog as I'd worry about them falling off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I tested these, I was very interested to get reactions from friends and family. I didn't get many positive comments about how they looked on my face, though a few particularly generous colleagues assured me I was "pulling them off." But seeing people's reactions as soon as the display activated was another matter. Almost everyone has had the same initial reaction: "whoa."&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="bdcc9840-607e-4bbc-82a4-28e379bf32f8">Quality display with some limitations</h2>
<p>As I discussed in my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html" data-i13n="slk:initial impressions;cpos:4;pos:1">initial impressions</a>, these glasses have a monocular display on the right side, so it doesn't offer the kind of immersive AR I experienced with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html" data-i13n="slk:Orion prototype;cpos:5;pos:1">Orion prototype</a> last year. You have to look slightly up and to the right to focus on the full-color display. It's impressively bright and clear, but doesn't overtake your vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 20 degrees, the field of view is small, but it never felt like a limitation. Because the content you see isn't meant to be immersive, it never feels like what's on the display is being cut off or like you have to adjust where you're looking to properly see it. The display itself has three main menus: an app launcher, a kind of home screen where you can access Meta AI and view notifications and a settings page for adjusting brightness, volume and other preferences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For now, there are only a handful of Meta-created "apps" available. You can check your Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger inboxes and chat with Meta AI. There's also a simple maps app for walking navigation, a music/audio player, camera and live translation and captioning features. There's also a mini puzzle game called "Hypertrail."</p>
<p>One of my favorite integrations was the ability to check Instagram DMs. Not only can you quickly read and respond to messages, you can watch Reels sent by your friends. While the video quality isn't as high as what you'd see on your phone, there's something very cool about quickly watching a clip without having to pull out your phone. Meta is also working on a standalone Reels experience that I'm very much looking forward to.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed being able to view media sent in my family group chats on WhatsApp. I often would end up revisiting the photos on videos once I pulled out my phone, but being able to instantly see these messages as they came in tickled whatever part of my brain responds to instant gratification.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The display also solves one of my biggest complaints with Meta's other smart glasses: that it's really difficult to frame photos. When you open the camera app on the display model, you can see a preview of the photo and even use a gesture to zoom in to properly frame your shot. Similarly, if you're on a WhatsApp video call you can see both the other person's video as well as a small preview of your own like you would on your phone's screen. It's a cool trick but the small display felt too cramped for a proper video call. People I used this with also told me that my video feed had some quality issues despite being on Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The glasses' live captioning and translation features are probably the best examples of Meta bringing its existing AI features into the display. I've written before about how Meta AI's translation abilities are one of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html" data-i13n="slk:my favorite;cpos:6;pos:1">my favorite</a> features of the Ray-Ban smart glasses. Live translation on the display is even better, because it delivers a real-time text feed of what the person in front of you is saying. I tried it out with my husband, a native Spanish speaker, and it was even more natural than the non-display glasses because I didn't have to pause and wait for the audio to relay what he was saying. It still wasn't an exactly perfect translation, and there were still a few occasions when it didn't catch everything he said, but it made the process so much simpler overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, live captions transcribes conversations in real-time into a similar text feed. I've found that it's a cool way to demo these glasses' capabilities, but I haven't yet found an occasion to use this in anything other than a demo. However, I still think it could be useful as an accessibility aid for anyone who has trouble hearing or processing audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another feature that's useful for travel is walking navigation. Dictate an address or location (you can say something like "take me to the closest Starbucks") and the glasses' display will guide you on your route. The first time I tried this was the roughly 10-minute walk from my bus stop to Yahoo's San Francisco office. The route only required two turns, but it didn't quite work. My glasses confidently navigated me to an alleyway behind the office building rather than the entrance. These kinds of mishaps happen with lots of mapping tools — Meta's maps rely on data from OpenStreetMap and Overture — but it was a good reminder that it's still early days for this product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't use Meta AI a ton on any of my smart glasses, but having a bit of visual feedback for these interactions was a nice change. I retain information much better from reading than listening, so seeing text-based output to my queries felt a lot more helpful. It's also nice that for longer responses from the assistant, you can stop the audio playback and swipe through informational cards instead.</p>

<p>While cooking dinner one night, I asked for a quick recipe for teriyaki salmon and Meta AI supplied what seemed like a passable recipe onto the display. The only drawback was the display goes to sleep pretty quickly unless you continue to interact with the content you're seeing, so the recipe I liked disappeared before I could actually attempt it. (You can view your Meta AI history in the Meta AI app if you really want to revisit something.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main complaint is that I want to be able to do much more with the display. Messaging app integrations are nice, but I wish the display worked with more of the apps on my phone. When it worked best, I was happy to be able to view and dismiss messaging notifications without having to touch my phone; I just wish it worked with all my phone's notifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also some frustrating limitations on sending and receiving texts. For example, there's no simple way to take a photo on your glasses and text it to a friend with the glasses. You have to wait for the glasses to send a "preview" of your message to your phone and then manually send the text. Or, you can opt in to Meta's cloud services and send the photo immediately as a link, but I'm not sure many of my friends would readily open a "media.meta.com" URL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The glasses also don't really support non-WhatsApp group chats, at least on iOS. You can receive messages sent in group chats, but there's no indication the message originated in a group thread. And, it's impossible to reply in the same thread; instead, replies are sent directly to the person who texted, which can get confusing if you're not checking your phone. It was also a little annoying that reading and even replying to texts from my glasses wouldn't mark the text as read in my phone's inbox. Meta blames all this on Apple's iOS restrictions, and says it's hoping to work with the company to improve the experience.&nbsp;The company tells me that group messaging should work normally for people with Android devices and that there is also a dedicated inbox for checking texts on the glasses. I haven’t tested this out yet. </p>
<h2 id="349fd7d6-e3b7-4738-9680-8ed1a31ae0c9">The band + battery life</h2>
<p>The glasses are controlled using Meta's Neural Band, which can translate subtle gestures like finger taps into actions on the display. Because the band relies on <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link rapid-with-clickid rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=df191793-b225-49b9-a438-e963044e3134&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Meta&amp;linkText=electromyography&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9lbWVyZ2luZy10ZWNoL2VtZy13ZWFyYWJsZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGYxOTE3OTMtYjIyNS00OWI5LWE0MzgtZTk2MzA0NGUzMTM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9lbWVyZ2luZy10ZWNoL2VtZy13ZWFyYWJsZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaZA1zwo3dm6DSVFIxfcB-DtLh7hxrNexCpXFeN3b-Yb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Femerging-tech%2Femg-wearable-technology%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Meta;elmt:;slk:electromyography;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/emg-wearable-technology/">electromyography</a> (EMG), you do need a fairly snug fit for it to work properly. I didn't find it uncomfortable, but, like the glasses, I don't love how it looks as a daily accessory. It also requires daily charging if you wear the glasses all day.</p>
<p>But the band does work surprisingly well. In more than a week, it almost never missed a gesture, and it never falsely registered a gesture, despite my efforts to confuse it by fidgeting or rubbing my fingers together. The gestures themselves are also pretty intuitive and don't take long to get used to: double tapping your thumb and middle fingers wakes up or puts the display to sleep, single taps of your index and middle fingers allow you to select an item or go back, and swiping your thumb along the side of your index finger lets you navigate around the display. There are a few others, but those are the ones I used most often.</p>

<p>Each time you make a gesture, the band emits a small vibration so you get a bit of haptic feedback letting you know it registered. I've used hand tracking-based navigation in various VR, AR and mixed reality devices and I've always felt a bit goofy waving my hands around. But the neural band gestures work when your hand is by your side or in your pocket.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other major drawback of these glasses is that heavy use of the display drains the battery pretty quickly. Meta says the Ray-Ban Display’s battery can go about six hours on a single charge, but it really depends on how much you're using the display. With very limited use, l was able to stretch the battery to about seven hours, but if you're doing display-intensive tasks like video calling or live translation, it will die much, much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The glasses do come with a charging case that can deliver a few extra charges on-the-go, but I was a bit surprised at how often I had to recharge the case. With my normal Ray-Ban Meta glasses I can go several days without topping up the charging case, but with the Meta Ray-Ban Display case, I'm charging it at least every other day.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="39901e8f-4170-4fec-b082-8f368b371adf">Privacy and safety</h2>
<p>Whenever I write or post on social media about a pair of Meta-branded glasses, I inevitably hear from people concerned about the privacy implications of these devices. As I wrote in my recent review of Meta's <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html" data-i13n="slk:second-gen Ray-Ban;cpos:8;pos:1">second-gen Ray-Ban</a> glasses, I share a lot of these concerns. Meta has made subtle but meaningful changes to its glasses' privacy policy over the last year, and its track record suggests these devices will inevitably scoop up more of our data over time.</p>
<p>In terms of privacy implications of the display-enabled glasses, there isn't a meaningful difference compared to their counterparts. Meta's policies are the same for all its wearables. I suppose you could use live translation to surreptitiously eavesdrop on a conversation you wouldn't typically understand, though that's technically possible with Meta's other glasses too. And the addition of a wrist-based controller means taking photos is a bit less obvious, but there's still an LED indicator that lights up when the camera is on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been surprised at how many people have asked me if these glasses have some kind of facial recognition abilities. I'm not sure if that's a sign of people's general distrust of Meta, or an assumption based on seeing similar glasses in sci-fi flicks, but I do think it's telling. (They don't, to be clear. Meta currently only uses facial recognition for two <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-back-facial-recognition-with-new-safety-features-for-facebook-and-instagram-222523426.html" data-i13n="slk:safety-related features;cpos:9;pos:1">safety-related features</a> on Facebook and Instagram.) Meta hasn't done much to earn people's trust when it comes to privacy, and I wish the company would use its growing wearables business to try to prove otherwise.</p>
<p>On a more practical level, I have some safety concerns. The display didn't hinder my situational awareness while walking, but I could see how it might for others. And I'm definitely not comfortable using the display while driving. Meta does have an audio-only "driving detection" setting that can automatically kick in when you're traveling in a car, but the feature is optional, which seems potentially problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="0af5c1fd-f042-43e9-b313-68713e7a3c9a">Should you buy these?</h2>
<p>In short: probably not. As much as I've been genuinely impressed with Meta's display tech, I don't think these glasses make sense for most people right now. And, at $800, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are more than twice as much as the company's <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html" data-i13n="slk:very good;cpos:10;pos:1">very good</a> second-generation Ray-Ban glasses, which come in a wide range of much more normal-looking frame styles and colors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, on the other hand, still look very much like a first-gen product. There are some really compelling use cases for the display, but its functionality is limited. The glasses are also too thick and bulky for what's meant to be an everyday accessory. At the end of the day, most people want glasses that make them look good. There’s also the fact that right now, these glasses are somewhat difficult to actually buy. They are only available at a handful <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-and-try-the-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-121500138.html" data-i13n="slk:of physical retailers;cpos:11;pos:1">of physical retailers</a>, which currently have a very limited supply, Meta is also requiring would-be buyers to schedule demo appointments in order to buy, though some stores — like the LensCrafters where I bought my pair — aren’t enforcing this.</p>
<p>Still, there's a lot to be excited about. Watching people's reactions to trying these has been almost as much fun as using them myself. Meta also has a solid lineup of new features already in the works, including a standalone Reels app, a teleprompter and gesture-based handwriting for message replies. If you're already all-in on smart glasses or, like me, you've been patiently waiting for glasses with a high quality, usable display, then the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are worth the investment now — as long as you can accept the thick frames.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US and Saudi Arabia have managed to derail negotiations regarding a landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vnl0yxg53o">according to a report by the <em>BBC</em></a>. The deal had <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/pressbriefings/pages/imo-approves-netzero-regulations.aspx">already been approved</a> and would have made shipping the world&#39;s first industry to adopt internationally mandated emissions guidelines.</p>
<p>Representatives from more than 100 countries had gathered in London to formally approve the so-called global carbon tax, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://earthgovernance.org/blog/countries-reach-historic-deal-to-cut-shipping-emissions/">after nearly ten years of negotiations</a>. However, the US government had been pressuring countries to vote &quot;no&quot; on the measure, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/climate/imo-shipping-carbon-tax-trump">threatening tariffs</a> if met with noncompliance.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The US also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/taking-action-to-defend-america-from-the-uns-first-global-carbon-tax-the-international-maritime-organizations-imo-net-zero-framework-nzf">threatened other sanctions</a>, including blocking vessels from ports and visa restrictions. President Trump <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115385308751129485">has called it</a> a &quot;global green new scam.&quot; The country <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-exits-carbon-talks-shipping-urges-others-follow-document-2025-04-09/">withdrew from talks back in April</a>, just before the plan was approved.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia instituted a plan to derail negotiations. The country tabled a motion to adjourn talks for a year, at a time when most countries were set to vote on it. That passed by just a handful of votes, with approving votes coming from both the US and Russia.</p>
<p>This essentially destroys the plan, despite technically being just a delay, as timelines will have to be renegotiated. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1979209616425644482">&quot;huge win&quot;</a> for Trump.</p>

<p>Even the shipping industry was on-board with the plan, as it offered consistent global standards that don&#39;t currently exist. Industries like certainty. Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping, said that the organization is &quot;disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.&quot; He also said that the &quot;industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, carbon dioxide levels <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/carbon-dioxide-levels-increase-record-amount-new-highs-2024">reached record highs in 2024</a> and we aren&#39;t doing too much about it. This agreement would&#39;ve forced ship owners to use cleaner fuels beginning in 2028, or face fines. Shipping currently makes up around three percent of global carbon emissions, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/2023-imo-strategy-on-reduction-of-ghg-emissions-from-ships.aspx">but that&#39;s expected to rise</a> by anywhere from ten percent to 150 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Countries are expected to reconvene in April to discuss the plan, but this will likely not feature a vote. It&#39;ll likely be a renegotiation from the ground up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-and-saudi-arabia-just-derailed-a-global-plan-to-cut-shipping-emissions-184204170.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 10th TwitchCon is underway. The weekend&#39;s opening keynote covered new features for streamers and some enforcement changes. As for the latter, Twitch is, in most cases, moving away from blanket bans and toward targeted enforcement. So, a chat violation may not affect an account&#39;s ability to stream, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Dual-format streaming, which <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/twitch-is-adding-1440p-and-vertical-streaming-091533811.html">lets you go live in vertical and horizontal views</a> at once, is getting a beta rollout. Twitch tested the feature with a small number of accounts beginning in August. The wider beta kicks off next week.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, AI made an appearance at the keynote. First, Auto Clips is a new feature that automates highlight creation for streamers. Twitch also mentioned that Meta&#39;s AI glasses will soon support Twitch live-streaming. (We first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html">learned that feature was coming</a> at Meta Connect in September.) An update to the Twitch mobile app will add that support within &quot;the next few months.&quot;</p>
<p>Streamers will be happy to learn that Twitch is adding ways for them to make money. It plans to increase the number of sponsorship deals on the platform. The company said this was due to growing advertiser enthusiasm for Twitch streamers. Twitch will begin rolling out the new offers to all monetizing streamers (including affiliates) in the coming months.</p>
<p>TwitchCon runs through this Sunday in San Diego.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/twitch-rule-breakers-rejoice-targeted-enforcement-will-replace-blanket-bans-183046229.html?src=rss]]></description>

The over 100-person unit is represented by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), and counts &quot;software engineers, designers, artists, quality assurance testers and producers&quot; among its members.</p><p>Inspiration to form the new union came from the successful organizing efforts of Blizzard&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/world-of-warcraft-workers-unlock-form-a-union-achievement-220148151.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>World of Warcraft</em> workers</a> last year. The staff behind the classic MMO formed the Warcraft Gamemakers Guild last year, and were followed by similar unions representing developers working on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/over-450-diablo-developers-at-blizzard-have-unionized-180544383.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Diablo</em></a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-developers-behind-overwatch-have-unionized-154021756.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Overwatch</em></a> earlier in 2025. According to the CWA, over 1,900 workers at Blizzard are now represented by the organization.</p><p>The new union is arriving at a critical time. Blizzard&#39;s parent company Microsoft made major cuts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">across its gaming division</a> this summer, including layoffs that reportedly led to Blizzard <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blizzard-is-giving-up-on-its-warcraft-mobile-game-amid-layoffs-215021940.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">winding down development</a> on <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>. Union membership has flourished across Microsoft&#39;s studios because of neutrality agreements the company signed with CWA respecting its workers&#39; right to organize at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-unionization-agreement-cwa-163550095.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Activision Blizzard in 2022</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-cwa-forge-labor-neutrality-agreement-covering-all-zenimax-workers-212643324.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ZeniMax in 2024</a>, but the environment is on the brink of possible change.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><em>Aftermath </em>reports</a> that the neutrality agreement covering Activision Blizzard workers expires in October 2025, which could make forming future unions more difficult.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is taking a new anti-spam feature for a spin. On Friday, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/whatsapp-will-curb-the-number-of-messages-people-and-businesses-can-send-without-a-response/">reported</a> that the trial limits the number of messages accounts can send without a reply from the recipient. The company is currently experimenting with different limits. But it&#39;s aiming for a number that only targets high-volume senders and spammers.</p>
<p>All messages from individuals and businesses are said to count toward this cap. That includes multiple unread ones sent to the same recipient. But if the person replies, those messages are removed from the monthly tally. WhatsApp will show a warning to accounts nearing the limit.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company told <em>TechCrunch</em> that average users won&#39;t likely reach the limit. It&#39;s generally good form for individuals not to keep messaging people who don&#39;t reply anyway. So, the test indeed sounds tailor-made for businesses and spammers. The test will roll out in multiple countries over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The trial is the Meta-owned company&#39;s latest attempt to fend off its festering spam and scam problem. Last year, it <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/whatsapp-will-finally-let-you-unsubscribe-from-business-marketing-spam/">added</a> the ability to unsubscribe from businesses&#39; marketing messages. This August, it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-adds-new-warning-about-potential-group-chat-messaging-scams-160013367.html">began notifying users</a> when someone not in their contacts adds them to a group. Alongside that announcement, WhatsApp said it banned over 6.8 million accounts linked to scam centers in the first half of 2025.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-will-test-a-monthly-cap-on-messages-ignored-by-recipients-164024928.html?src=rss]]></description>

The new console certainly looks like the original. You can practically smell the cigarette-soaked carpeting from here.</p>
<p>Beyond aesthetics, this console includes plenty of newfangled bells and whistles. The controllers are wireless, which is a technology that didn&#39;t quite exist in the 1980s, and it connects to TVs via HDMI.</p>

<p>It also includes 45 built-in games, reminding me of stuff like the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-11-nes-classic-edition-review.html"><ins>NES Classic</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ataris-2600-is-a-miniature-console-that-plays-2600-and-7800-game-carts-171014464.html"><ins>Atari 2600+</ins></a>. The library includes plenty of sports and strategy titles, because those genres were considered the console&#39;s biggest strength way back when. Other games include the puzzler <em>Boulder Dash</em> and a riff on <em>Space Invaders</em> called<em> Space Armada</em>. Each title comes with a unique overlay that gets placed on the gamepad, showing off the controls.</p>

The Frame Pro can display lifelike art pieces when the TV isn't in use, while its sleek design means it also looks great when turned off.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The Frame Pro comes with Samsung's new Wireless One Connect Box, which is supposed to help with cable management by putting the TV's inputs in a separate box that then wirelessly transmits the feed from your external device to the TV. It does require its own power supply, though, so that's one more plug needed if you are connecting a console or a streaming device.</p> 
<p>The TV also carries the NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor, which imbues the Frame Pro with AI-enhanced picture and sound. This model also comes with Samsung Vision AI, which works to upscale the image on screen, create personalized experiences and more.</p>

<p>Bose debuted a few new features on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">second-gen QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds</a> in August that it carried over to these new headphones. First, the company improved its already stellar active noise cancelation (ANC) with tweaks to its ActiveSense technology. Specifically, the system can respond to sudden spikes in environmental noise by adapting more precisely. It’s not something you’ll notice all the time, but when you need it, you’ll be glad it's there. Otherwise, the excellent ANC performance here is just as effective as it was on the previous model. More on that in a bit.</p> 
<p>The immersive Cinema Mode that Bose added to the QC Ultra Earbuds is also available on these headphones. It’s a sound profile that enhances dialogue clarity while keeping the rest of the soundstage as wide and enveloping as possible. I like it best for movies and TV, as the name suggests, but per Bose’s suggestion I also tried it with podcasts and audiobooks. Cinema Mode is probably overkill for those types of content, unless you’re listening to shows or titles with lots of background effects.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the biggest changes on the second-gen QC Ultra Headphones is how Bose decided to handle power management. Most importantly, the company extended battery life in all use cases. With ANC on (and Immersive Audio off), you’ll get up to 30 hours of listening time. Turn off ANC and that jumps to 45 hours. When you decide to enable both ANC and Bose’s spatial Immersive Audio, you can expect up to 23 hours on a charge. Compared to those on the first-generation model, all of these numbers are up by at least five hours, which is a significant boost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the previous QC Ultra Headphones, this model has an automatic disconnection feature after 10 minutes of standby . But the company went a step further on this version by adding a low-power mode that the headphones enter after 30 minutes of idle time. And if you want to disconnect them quickly, you can rotate the earcups and lay them on a flat surface. That’ll make them go into a deeper standby mode that Bose says can run “for months.” All of this means you can effectively turn the new QuietComfort Ultra Headphones on and off by putting them on and taking them off. If you’re using them regularly, you’ll never have to press the power button.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sound-wise, the big upgrade on these headphones is the addition of lossless audio over USB-C. Like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-use-lossless-audio-on-the-airpods-max-180026218.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">the AirPods Max</a>, this model can be connected with a cable to your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop to stream or play higher-quality tunes from compatible services or your library. Bose says you can expect 16-bit 44.1kHz or 48kHz audio depending on your source. It’s yet another nice-to-have feature that’s becoming standard fare on premium wireless headphones.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="6ec6f9ce-6704-4ff3-a2e7-48ad98a0220b">What else is good about the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones?</h2> 
<p>Like most Bose over-ear headphones, the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are supremely comfortable. Even for long periods of time, they never become a burden, and that’s thanks in large part to the soft, pillowy ear pads. I could easily wear these for an entire trans-Atlantic flight with minimal discomfort and I’ve been wearing them for entire workdays at home.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As I already mentioned, the ANC performance here is still top-tier. In fact, these QC Ultra Headphones will soon replace the first-gen model on our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">best noise-canceling headphones</a> list. Both the Immersion (ANC + spatial audio) and Quiet (just ANC) modes provide robust noise blocking that surpasses those by Sony, Sennheiser and others. If you’re making your buying decision based solely on ANC performance, this is the best option. You’ll enjoy relief from constant ambient noise sources like fans and sound machines, plus the QC Ultra Headphones do a respectable job with human voices. Heck, I couldn’t even hear my dog barking at the imminent threat from falling leaves outside.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lastly, Bose’s take on spatial audio is still quite good. The company calls it Immersive Audio and the feature doesn’t rely on specialized content like other headphones. Music sounds obviously fuller and slightly louder when the sound profile is active thanks to Bose’s method for upscaling stereo content. There’s also enhanced vocal clarity and elements like percussion and synths are less compressed than usual. The headphones lend a particularly airy feel to the tracks of Ruston Kelly’s <em>Pale, Through the Window, </em>an acoustic-driven collection of soulful, country-tinged tunes. His vocals float atop enveloping acoustic guitars and tight, punchy drums.</p>

<p>The biggest issue with the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones is the price. To be clear, the likes of Sony, Apple and others charge around the same amount for their top-of-the-line models, but $449 is still a significant investment. If that’s too steep for you, Bose has the highly capable <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D4Z9C562&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3d41a5af-352a-4bc5-ba97-fe90dc78f118&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=QuietComfort+Headphones&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL2F3L2QvQjBENFo5QzU2Mi8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2Q0MWE1YWYtMzUyYS00YmM1LWJhOTctZmU5MGRjNzhmMTE4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL2F3L2QvQjBENFo5QzU2Mi8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXVICQZ9BTRe97zgQ7boTMH05Q_Q2HOFIO8CZDVVchdt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Faw%2Fd%2FB0D4Z9C562%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D4Z9C562/?th=1">QuietComfort Headphones</a> in its arsenal for a <em>slightly </em>more palatable $359.</p> 
<p>My other gripe is that the only real design change Bose made for the updated QC Ultra Headphones is that the metal headband yokes now have a gloss finish. Depending on your personal preference, this might be a dealbreaker for you. It’s least noticeable on the black and violet colorways, since these have a tone-on-tone look. After a few weeks with the bronze and tan Driftwood Sand hue, I’m not a fan of the more stylized aesthetic. It’s flashy, for sure, but it’s a tweak I could’ve done without.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="ae6bcab8-6a1e-4aaa-821a-abc1395d4039">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>Similar to the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds over the summer, Bose didn’t make huge upgrades for the updated version of the QC Ultra Headphones. But what you do get here is a decent improvement over its predecessor. The company devised an intuitive setup for power management and even addressed one of my main gripes with the original by adding support for lossless audio over USB-C. Plus, the extended battery life is significant in all sound modes, and not just by an hour or two here or there. To top it all off, the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones remain the best option for pure noise-blocking ability, and that’s not likely to change any time soon.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="270ce75f-b558-4456-ad98-7f2c485d6739" />
