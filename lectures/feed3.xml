                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The breadth and reach of Australia&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/australia-is-one-step-away-from-banning-social-media-for-under-16s-160454882.html"><ins>pioneering social media ban</ins></a> grows as livestream platform Twitch has now been added to the list of banned platforms for users under 16 years of age. The nationwide ban is the first of its kind and encompasses Facebook, X, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube and recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-be-included-in-australias-looming-under-16-social-media-ban-213052856.html"><ins>Reddit</ins></a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n2955g10o"><em><ins>BBC</ins></em></a>, Australia&#39;s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said Twitch had been included because it was &quot;a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>No other platforms are expected to be added before the law goes into effect next month. Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest would not be included in the ban because the core purpose of the platform was not online social interaction.</p>
<p>Under the ban, platforms are expected to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to prevent underage users from accessing their platforms, and face steep fees for failure to comply. While <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html"><ins>VPNs</ins></a> may provide a workaround in some instances, the law still creates an enormous barrier to entry for users under 16.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/denmark-set-to-ban-social-media-for-users-under-15-years-of-age-171602408.html"><ins>Denmark announced</ins></a> its lawmakers had reached a bipartisan agreement to enact a similar ban for users under 15, though details were scarce. In the US, several states have attempted to enact such a ban including <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/texas-is-getting-ready-to-ban-social-media-for-anyone-under-18-180202219.html"><ins>Texas</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/floridas-social-media-law-has-been-temporarily-blocked-by-a-federal-judge-123004847.html"><ins>Florida</ins></a>, though these measures either failed to pass or are held up in court. Even laws that don&#39;t go as far, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/utah-judge-blocks-law-preventing-youth-from-accessing-social-media-freely-160008587.html"><ins>Utah&#39;s law</ins></a> requiring parents to grant permission for teens to open social media accounts, are facing stiff opposition on First Amendment grounds.</p>

This &quot;Teammates&quot; project builds on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-partners-with-ubisoft-to-further-develop-its-ai-driven-npcs-160432137.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Neo NPCs</a> Ubisoft showed off with Nvidia in 2024 to demo in-game AI that can naturally respond to players. A key difference this time, besides the complexity of the interactions the prototype supports, is that Teammates is already being played in a closed playtest with &quot;a few hundred players,&quot; Ubisoft says.</p><p>Teammates, even if Ubisoft describes it as a playable &quot;experimental research project,&quot; still uses the basic concepts of a first-person shooter. The prototype casts players as &quot;a member of the resistance in a dystopian future, tasked with moving through an enemy base to locate five missing members of their team,&quot; where directing in-game AI characters is key to success. Ubisoft came up with three AI NPCs for the project, &quot;Jaspar,&quot; an AI assistant with awareness of in-game lore and the ability to adjust game settings on the fly, and &quot;Pablo&quot; and &quot;Sofia,&quot; robotic characters that are physically present in the game and can respond to commands.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ubisoft-Teammates-Jaspar-screen.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ubisoft-Teammates-Jaspar-screen.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A screen from Ubisoft Teammates showing the different things the Jaspar AI can do in-game." data-uuid="69c1dfc5-1e1e-49a3-a58c-c4db9712a363"><figcaption>Jaspar is both a diegetic and non-diegetic presence in Teammates.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ubisoft</div></figure><p>Based on footage shared with Engadget, Ubisoft&#39;s AI characters not only understand voice commands, but also have a visual awareness of what the player is seeing. A direction to &quot;stand behind a barrel&quot; prompted Sofia to take into consideration where the player was looking and position itself appropriately. In the version of Teammates available in the closed playtest, Ubisoft also uses Jaspar to onboard and teach players about the basics of the game. In most cases, the AI characters seemed overly chatty and verbose, but Ubisoft is experimenting with letting players choose sets of personalities for Sofia and Pablo — including an option curiously labelled &quot;Bad Cat and Good Boy&quot; — that can change up how each character expresses itself.</p><p>&quot;This technology opens doors to new, personalized experiences,&quot; Ubisoft&#39;s Data &amp; AI Director Rémi Labory shared in the Teammates announcement. &quot;Player input shapes character reactions in real time, something traditional development can&#39;t achieve. We&#39;re also delivering a full pipeline, with the experience taking players from onboarding to debrief, which is a first.&quot;</p><p>Ubisoft has explored applying generative AI to other parts of the development process in the past. The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-ghostwriter-ai-tool--automatically-generate-video-game-dialogue-103510366.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Ghostwriter</a> tool, introduced in 2023, uses AI to generate first drafts of in-game dialogue. Ubisoft <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-admits-ai-generated-loading-screen-slipped-through-into-final-build-of-anno-117-pax-romana" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">also recently adimitted</a> to publishing <em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em> without removing its AI-generated loading screen art.</p><p>Ultimately, the underlying technology powering Teammates could appear in other Ubisoft projects in the future. The company is collecting feedback from its playtest to apply towards future research, but Ubisoft suggests the middleware it created for Teammates already works with both its Snowdrop and Anvil engines, opening up the tool for future teams to use in their games.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-made-a-prototype-game-with-voice-controlled-ai-teammates-200834163.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>
<p>Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html">VPN deal</a> this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to Proton VPN.</p>

Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.</p></li>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-white-elephant">What is white elephant?</h3> 
<p>A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-does-white-elephant-work">How does white elephant work?</h3> 
<p>A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-it-called-white-elephant">Why is it called white elephant?</h3> 
<p>The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has started inserting ads into query results from its AI Mode, which was originally spotted by an SEO consultant named Brodie Clark. These ads show up in the bottom of search results in the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html">Gemini-powered AI Mode</a>. They are labeled as &quot;sponsored&quot; content, but otherwise look similar to other links whipped up by the chatbot.</p>
<p>Google says this is just a test and that ads shouldn&#39;t be showing up for all users. The company also <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/21/google-showing-ads-ai-mode/">told <em>9to5Google</em> </a>that there are no current plans to fully update AI Mode to incorporate ads. Those are nice words, but <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2025-06-30-accounting-gaffs-artificial-income-aff55b5655bf">AI has to make money somehow</a> and ads seem to be a good way to do that.</p>

<p>For now, the software seems to be prioritizing organic links over sponsored links, but we all know how insidious ads can be <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-investigating-ad-sale-practices-at-google-and-amazon-160236895.html">once the floodgates open</a>. AI presents an especially slippery slope here, as these chatbots are often advertised as personal assistants. I don&#39;t really want a personal assistant barking ads at me 24/7.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to hide the aforementioned sponsored links. Google Search lets users hide sponsored results <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-making-search-ads-more-and-less-avoidable-215658127.html">once they scroll past them</a>.</p>
<p>It sure looks like our free ride is already coming to an end, as AI companies are really speedrunning through <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/discords-cto-is-just-as-worried-about-enshittification-as-you-are-173049834.html">that whole enshittification thing</a>.

This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support.

The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.)

We&#39;re only halfway through November, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there&#39;s even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you&#39;re saving) and one of the best offers I&#39;ve ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We&#39;ll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live.</p>

I, however, am an evolved being who swims in the digital ether, so my top product of the year lives only online — though <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:DeleteMe;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7d48c1c9-2588-41e8-bc6e-de9a027140d8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1f0a549c-9507-4c93-82af-a56991c06c2d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DeleteMe&amp;linkText=DeleteMe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2pvaW5kZWxldGVtZS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxZjBhNTQ5Yy05NTA3LTRjOTMtODJhZi1hNTY5OTFjMDZjMmQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vam9pbmRlbGV0ZW1lLmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX1fxpIusus5dWtGalKnaSzxn8qU5iyS3js0EYRByXtu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fjoindeleteme.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://joindeleteme.com/">DeleteMe</a> will still improve your life wherever you are.

<p>Chances are you&#39;ve seen at least one public-facing &quot;people search&quot; site. You know the ones: they usually have names like 411.info or Find.people, and you can type in a person&#39;s name and find all the info the site has been able to scrape on them. If you search your own name, it&#39;s hard to avoid immediately running to the kitchen to make yourself a tinfoil hat. The most annoying thing is that these &quot;data broker&quot; sites are perfectly legal to run and use.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>However, that&#39;s also their Achilles&#39; heel. If they want to operate in the open, brokers legally have to include a way for you to remove yourself from their database. Most of them make it as aggravating and time-consuming as possible, but the option is there.</p> 
<p>That&#39;s where DeleteMe comes in. All you have to do is sign up and enter all the data you want removed from brokerage sites. DeleteMe handles the rest. It searches for your information on people database sites, automatically sends opt-out requests, bugs the broker if they don&#39;t comply quickly enough and gives you a weekly report on how it&#39;s doing. You do have to be OK with DeleteMe itself having your data, but I trust them way more than the randos over at violate.privacy.</p> 
<p>It&#39;s so much faster than handling all the opt-out requests yourself, which — if you&#39;ve ever tried it — rapidly becomes a full-time job. Since I&#39;ve been using DeleteMe, I almost never get spam calls or texts anymore, except in short bursts before its crawlers catch my name on another site. And yes, it doesn&#39;t work on shady data brokers who don&#39;t follow the rules, but it&#39;s still a massive reduction of your online footprint.</p> 
<p>The only problem is that it&#39;s pretty expensive, so I strongly recommend jumping on this Black Friday deal. A few months on DeleteMe should be long enough for you to see if it reduces spam for you — and I&#39;m betting it will.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-most-effective-anti-spam-tool-ive-ever-used-is-on-sale-for-black-friday-190526952.html?src=rss]]></description>

Owners of other models? Well, you’ll have to wait a bit longer. Regardless, the company&#39;s Nothing OS 4.0 update brings Google&#39;s newest mobile software, along with a bunch of UI tweaks.</p><p>In addition to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-16-is-out-complete-with-new-features-for-pixel-phones-including-live-notification-updates-170006935.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Android 16</a>, Nothing OS 4.0 should deliver a smoother, zippier experience. The company promises &quot;faster responses, cleaner visuals, smoother interactions&quot; and more. Along those lines, app transitions, the notification shade and gestures have been redesigned to respond &quot;with sharper tactility and depth.&quot;</p><p>Nothing also redesigned its first-party icons, with cleaner, more minimal styling. &quot;The home screen feels balanced, modern and comfortable to use,&quot; the company claims. Status bar icons have been refined, drawing inspiration from Android 16’s stylings. There are also new lock-screen clocks to choose from, and an &quot;extra dark mode&quot; (in addition to standard dark mode), designed for nighttime reading.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/1763671923-99439-workhub-88.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/1763671923-99439-workhub-88.png" style="height:1688px;width:3000px;" alt="A marketing grid, showcasing Nothing OS 4.0&#39;s new features." data-uuid="4ac359a3-30ef-408e-99b4-7bc4b0268cae"/><figcaption>A marketing grid, showcasing Nothing OS 4.0&#39;s new features.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nothing</div></figure><p>The Glyph Interface has always been one of Nothing&#39;s most unique features, and it gets some updates, too.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has confirmed that its third-gen Super Heavy Booster, the first stage of the two-stage Starship system, suffered an explosive gas failure of sorts during testing on Thursday morning. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1991889258701885702">post on X</a>, the aerospace company said, &quot;Booster 18 suffered an anomaly during gas system pressure testing that we were conducting in advance of structural proof testing.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no propellant inside the booster as the engines were not installed at that point. No injuries were reported and the company shared that personnel are always kept at a safe distance during these types of tests. The company said it will &quot;need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The explosive release of gas, or whatever it was, seems to have blown out the side of the bottom half of the booster. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/StarshipGazer/status/1991845404212666603"><ins>Pictures taken</ins></a> by SpaceX content creators show this in detail.

<p>The booster is part of the third generation of Starship, SpaceX&#39;s enormous and fully reusable rocket designed for high payload capacity. The ship weighs 5,000 tons and towers over 400 feet in height (taller than a 30-story building).</p>

Sling TV is Engadget&#39;s pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html">the best customizable live streaming service</a> for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn&#39;t getting you all the channels you need, you don&#39;t need to pay that much more to get them.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

To watch those, you&#39;ll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn&#39;t available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month.</p> 
<p>Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you&#39;re getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV&#39;s DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV&#39;s interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you&#39;re likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/black-friday-streaming-deal-sling-orange-day-passes-are-only-1-right-now-231208837.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Secret Santa gift exchanges are supposed to be fun, but it’s easy to overthink it.

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items. But it would be wrong to think that only the most expensive tech is worth gifting. Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these. However, for the people in your life for which brand names really do matter, these gifts will speak to them.</p>

Since we spend our days testing and otherwise thinking about tech, most of the presents here have a gadget spin, but all of them are a heck of a lot more unique than a candle and a bath bomb.</p>

Engadget&#39;s Nathan Ingraham <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html">called</a> it &quot;a great speaker, whether or not it is playing songs in Dolby Atmos.&quot;</p> 
<p>That Dolby reference points to the Era 300&#39;s core novelty. It produces spatial audio without requiring additional speakers. (You can use Apple Music or Amazon Music to stream compatible tracks.) Expect those Dolby Atmos tracks to sound better with newer music than older songs remixed for Dolby&#39;s tech.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t bother with its spatial tricks, the Era 300 is a terrific-sounding speaker. It delivers rich, detailed and balanced audio that can hang with just about anything else Sonos offers.</p> 
<p>The speaker supports voice control via Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. It also offers Trueplay tuning, which listens to how your room shapes the sound and adjusts accordingly. In this model, you don&#39;t need to use your phone: Its built-in mics scan your room for you. That&#39;s especially handy for Android users, since phone-based Trueplay (from other models) is iOS-only.</p> 
<p>If the Era 300 is a bit out of your budget, Sonos has loads of other products on sale for Black Friday.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After several delays, Analogue finally started <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-will-at-long-last-ship-on-november-18-151854397.html"><ins>shipping</ins></a> its 4K remake of the Nintendo 64 this week. That was great news for those lucky enough to have pre-orders secured, but the console was firmly sold out beyond that first wave of shipments. However, the company has now <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1991899499653198293?s=61"><ins>announced</ins></a> that it will have new stock of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-is-almost-ready-and-its-a-big-deal-150033468.html"><ins>Analogue 3D</ins></a> ready to go from November 24.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to order from 8am PST on the day, with orders set to start shipping on December 2, once Analogue has honored all of its original pre-orders. This batch will likely go very quickly too, and if you do manage to get one, you’ll have to accept a (seemingly tariff-related) price $20 hike, with the Analogue 3D now costing $270.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with previous Analogue systems, the reimagined N64 uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate Nintendo’s original hardware. FPGA-based systems are more accurate than software emulation options and deliver reduced input lag.</p>
<p>Every N64 cartridge is supported, according to Analogue, including both PAL and NTSC variants, and the 3D is capable of 4K output with variable refresh rate. You also get an &quot;original display mode&quot; filter to faithfully recreate the look of gaming on your dusty old CRT.</p>
<p>A word of warning, though: while our <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html"><ins>review</ins></a> of the Analogue 3D praised the hardware design and strength of the emulation, our reviewer&#39;s biggest mark against the console is that a lot of N64 games just aren’t very fun to play in 2025. Still, if you still have the likes of <em>Mario 64 </em>and <em>Ocarina of Time </em>lying around in a cupboard, you’ll no doubt have an enjoyably nostalgic holiday season with the Analogue 3D, should you successfully get hold of one next week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-analogue-3d-will-be-restocked-on-november-24-but-itll-cost-20-more-173615217.html?src=rss]]></description>

I’ve tested a ton of them for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html">our buying guide</a>, and while the space has improved over time, it remains far too centered on branding and marketing.

When it’s discounted to this extent, it’s the rare gaming headset I’d call a solid bargain.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The hook with the Atlas Air is that it’s one of the few wireless headphones (let alone headsets) with an open-back design, meaning its ear cups don’t completely seal off your ears from air and outside noise. Pairs like this aren’t for everyone: They both let in and leak lots of ambient sound, so if you don’t use them in a quiet room, you and anyone nearby will probably be distracted. On the flipside, this can be a positive if you don’t want to be completely shut off from your surroundings. More notably, they can produce a far more spacious and natural sound than closed-back models. Games feel more like they’re happening around you instead of being confined to a space in your head.</p> 
<p>All of this holds true with the Atlas Air. Going from this pair to a traditional headset often makes it feel like a chunk of the world has been lopped off — giant boss fights in games like <em>Elden Ring</em> or <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>sound more narrow, and it becomes harder to gauge where exactly an opponent is coming from in a competitive shooter like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. It helps that the Atlas Air is also tuned well. It’s not as dynamic as the best non-gaming open headphones, and like most open-backs it doesn’t get super deep bass, so explosions and gunfire lack a little boom. But it’s balanced and easygoing, with a jump in the treble that helps dialogue and footsteps sound clearer.</p> 
<p>The headset itself is exceptionally comfortable beyond that. It’s lightweight at 0.66 pounds, and the big memory foam earcups clamp down gently without trapping much heat. The battery lasts a solid 50-60 hours on a charge, and while the mic isn’t the absolute best I’ve tested, it still lets you come through clearly. It all works with PC and PS5 by default, and you can pair with a Switch or Switch 2 over Bluetooth. There’s no Xbox wireless support, unfortunately, though you can at least use an included 3.5mm cable. And though the plastic design isn’t exactly “premium,” it hasn’t developed any sort of cracks or creakiness in the months I’ve used it. For $130, it’s totally fine.</p> 
<p>There are other things to nitpick: You can’t listen to two devices connected over the USB dongle and Bluetooth simultaneously; you want to ignore Turtle Beach’s companion software as soon as you update the firmware; and there isn’t much room to adjust the headband, so certain heads may struggle to find the best fit. The design is also kind of ugly, if I’m being honest. Still, in an samey market, the Atlas Air stands out. If you know you can live with the trade-offs that come with any open-back headset, it’s a unique value at this price.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/in-a-rare-deal-my-favorite-gaming-headset-is-28-percent-off-for-black-friday-165029987.html?src=rss]]></description>

While the ideal release window would have been last month to coincide with spooky season (PS Plus subscribers got lucky <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-silent-hill-2-and-until-dawn-remakes-will-hit-ps-plus-in-time-for-halloween-191333113.html"><ins>here</ins></a>), there’s never a <em>bad</em> time to play <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<p>A full remake of the seminal 2001 survival horror game, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> has you play as widower James Sunderland, who’s summoned to the eponymous rural town after receiving a letter from his deceased wife, where all manner of psychological horrors await him. Slightly controversially, the 2024 game ditched the fixed camera angles of the original in favor of a more modern over-the-shoulder perspective. Fortunately, this transition sacrifices none of the game’s signature oppressive atmosphere, with the foggy streets of Silent Hill being as creepy as ever to tentatively explore.</p>

<p>Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming.</p> 
<p>Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive.</p>

The appropriately-named Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is a MagSafe compatible device that snaps onto an iPhone. The grip can be &quot;removed with ease&quot; and also doubles as a stand.</p>
<p>To that end, it supports two different viewing angles, both vertical and horizontal. Apple says the ergonomic form factor was &quot;designed with accessibility in mind from the ground up&quot; and that Hikawa was given &quot;direct input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle strength, dexterity and hand control.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s also intended to be a work of art, as it was &quot;inspired by modern sculpture.&quot; This is what likely ticks the price up. The grip is available in two colorways, both of which cost $70. Generic grips cost around $10 on Amazon or big-box retailers, but Hikawa has been making <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18287292/phone-case-design-bailey-hikawa-kame-art-unconventional">noteworthy phone cases for years</a>.

Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tools/compare/tcl-qm7k-vs-hisense-u75qg/88608/96104">some reviews</a> say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content <em>too</em> bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it&#39;s not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set.

That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming.

It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-tech-sales-are-ready-to-shop-now-ahead-of-the-holiday-season-100052093.html?src=rss]]></description>

They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing.</p>

<p>Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">AirPods Pro 3 review</a> for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls.</p> 
<p>Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced.</p> 
<p>Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic.</p> 
<p>There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a> for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort.

After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-deals-anker-wireless-chargers">Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers</h2> 
<p>A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="http://solution.of/">solution</a>. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our<a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html"> wireless charger guide</a> and our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">best multi-device chargers</a>.

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-deals-anker-power-adapters">Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters</h2> 
<p>While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html">guide to the best fast chargers</a> and we recommend the brand in a number of our <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html">accessories</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-macbook-accessories-150014737.html">guides</a>.

Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again.

It’s the best budget tablet in Apple’s lineup and a great pick for streaming, note-taking or browsing without spending Pro-level money.</p> 
<p>Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="f39a3d15226f4e4b9ae712acc94251d6" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable.</p> 
<p>The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models.</p> 
<p>Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility.</p> 
<p>The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use.</p> 
<p>If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">best iPads</a> to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $279, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet.

But we now know that the delay was forced by an accounting issue relating to its soon-to-be finalized transaction with Tencent.</p>
<p>As detailed in Ubisoft’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf">now-published</a> first-half 2025-26 earnings figures, the company was required to restate its FY2024-25 accounts, concerning revenue for this period attributed to sales from a partnership. &quot;This position now applied by the Group going forward has also resulted in a partnership signed in Q2 FY2025-26 not being recognized in IFRS15 revenues,&quot; the company said. &quot;The above results in the Company not complying with its leverage covenant ratio under certain existing financing agreements at September 30, 2025. However, this is being addressed by the aforementioned actions relating to the concerned debt instruments.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the report now published, Ubisoft has asked Euronext to resume trading its shares. And while the accounting snag led to the week-long delay, the French company said that its deal with Tencent is set to close in &quot;the coming days,&quot; with the imminent €1.16 billion ($1.36 billion) investment expected to help the company pay off outstanding debt. Once finalized, the partnership will also &quot;enable the acceleration&quot; of Vantage Studios, the new <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-launches-its-new-tencent-backed-subsidiary-194750403.html">Ubisoft subsidiary</a> in which Tencent will own a 25 percent stake. The new studio will be responsible for Ubisoft’s three biggest IPs: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>Ubisoft reported net bookings of €491 million ($564 million) this quarter, which it said was a 39 percent year-on-year increase. The company said that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, which is getting a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/assassins-creed-shadows-will-hit-switch-2-on-december-2-172338735.html">Switch 2 port</a> next month, had overperformed this quarter, likely helped by arrival of its New Game+ mode in the summer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-delayed-its-latest-earnings-report-due-to-an-accounting-issue-152017119.html?src=rss]]></description>

This model is also available in storage sizes of 128GB and 512GB, but at the moment, only the 256GB model has a discount.</p> 
<p>This particular model easily made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

<p>We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark.</p> 
<p>The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn&#39;t just for Nintendo&#39;s latest console. It&#39;ll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.

That&#39;s $30 off its regular price and only $5 more than the record low.</p> 
<p>For the uninitiated, the Echo Spot is a diminutive little speaker/alarm clock hybrid unit. It&#39;s a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-revives-the-echo-spot-smart-alarm-clock-and-swiftly-discounts-it-by-44-percent-160304634.html">cute little doodad</a> and looks great on a nightstand. The screen is customizable, so it doesn&#39;t have to display a clock. It can show song titles, smart home control dashboards, the weather and a lot more. Of course, there are numerous clock faces to choose from.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

This is a smarter and more conversational version of the iconic smart assistant. Like most modern AI products, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">it&#39;s still working out some bugs</a>. The underlying tech, however, is promising.</p> 
<p>The speaker is decent enough for the size, though you won&#39;t be using it to fuel any house parties. It&#39;s a great tool for bedroom-based listening. This version doesn&#39;t have a camera, which is actually great news for the privacy conscious.</p> 
<p>In addition to the Echo Spot, you&#39;ll even find Black Friday deals on some of the latest Echo devices that just came out last month.

<p>As DJI’s new flagship non-360 action cam, the Action 6 goes up against <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/gopro-hero-13-black-release-date-price-hands-on-impressions-130027978.html">GoPro’s Hero 13</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-action-camera-130017459.html">Insta360 Ace Pro 2</a>. Both of those can capture higher resolution footage, so they’re better for most users in daylight conditions. However, if you shoot a lot in dim or contrasty light, DJI’s Action 6 may be your best option.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-variable-aperture">Variable aperture</h2> 
<p>I’ve already gone through the Osmo Action 6’s specs in my <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-action-6-is-the-first-action-cam-with-a-variable-aperture-120058873.html">earlier news post</a>, so check that to see the full details. As for what’s new, the first key feature is the variable f/2.0-f/4.0 aperture — the first ever in an action cam. This allows for brighter video and improved stabilization when shooting at night compared to the fixed f/2.8 aperture on the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-action-5-pro-review-finally-a-worthy-gopro-rival-143027778.html">Action 5 Pro</a>. It also offers shallower depth of field and more flexibility on sunny days.</p> 
<p>The first thing I noticed with this feature was the lack of full manual control. You can only set it to fixed f/2.6, f/2.8 and f/4.0 “starburst” modes, or automatic settings ranging from f/2.0-f/4.0 up to f/2.8-f/4.0. That means f/2.0 isn’t available as a fixed aperture, which is too bad as that would be ideal for portraits.</p> 
<div id="b9b8714957114e1b8fac54310bd8a477">

</div> 
<p>Still, variable aperture is a highly useful feature. In auto mode, it ramps from one setting to another in fine steps (f/2.1 to f/2.2, for example), so I never saw any exposure jumps. In low light, I could dial the ISO range down to avoid excessive noise, giving me higher video quality. However, I’d love to see full manual control in a future update.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-new-square-sensor">New square sensor</h2> 
<p>Another key feature is the new 1/1.1-inch (0.56 inch diagonal) square sensor that allows a wide range of resolutions and aspect ratios. The Action 6 supports vertical and horizontal resolutions up to 4K, in either 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios for the latter orientation. The best new setting, though, is Custom, which lets you shoot 3,840 x 3,840 square video.</p> 
<p>At 60 fps (a standard frame rate for action videos), GoPro’s Hero 13 maxes out at 5,312 x 2,988 pixels, while the Insta360 Ace Pro 2 can hit 3,840 x 2,880 pixels. That makes the Osmo Action 6 the only current action cam with 4K vertical resolution at 60 fps.</p> 
<p>The benefit is that you can film for both horizontal and vertical video platforms like YouTube and TikTok, respectively, with no need to rotate the camera and no loss in resolution. If that sounds familiar, it’s the same reason Apple adopted a square sensor on the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17s-new-selfie-camera-lets-you-take-group-shots-without-rotating-your-phone-195345475.html">iPhone 17’s front camera</a>.</p> 
<p>I tested the Custom aspect ratio in DaVinci Resolve Studio and it made exports a breeze. First, I created and exported a standard 4K horizontal timeline, then simply copied the contents to a vertical timeline. After reframing a few shots to keep the action centered, I was able to immediately export a 4K TikTok video. That’s a big time saver for busy editors.</p>

<p>With a 30 percent larger sensor, the Action 6 is better for night or interior shooting using 6,400 ISO and up. Compared to the Action 5 Pro, I found nighttime video from the Action 6 to be considerably cleaner. DJI also improved the Night setting itself: video is cleaner, noise reduction is applied less aggressively and everything looks more natural.</p> 
<p>The new sensor and variable aperture also help DJI’s Rocksteady 3.0 digital stabilization in low light. If you’re filming from a bicycle at night, for instance, the Action 6 will use a higher shutter speed than the Action 5, so video will be sharper. That helps the stabilization algorithm produce a better result with less pixelation and tearing.</p> 
<p>In daylight conditions, the Action 6 delivers sharp, color-accurate video that can be used straight out of the camera — just like the Action 5. However, in contrasty scenarios like a sun-dappled forest trail, the Action 6 has a slight advantage. When I engaged the 10-bit D-LogM setting to boost dynamic range, I noticed that dark shadow areas had more detail and less noise than they did in footage from the Action 5 Pro or GoPro Hero 13.</p> 
<p>However, the GoPro Hero 13’s extra resolution is an advantage if you mostly use YouTube and other horizontal formats. With up to 5,312 x 2,988 pixels at 60 fps, it offers sharper 4K video after supersampling and more room to reframe shots in post production without any loss in quality.</p>

<p>If you like shooting wide but hate the distortion, DJI’s Natural Wide field of view is a nice addition. The regular Wide setting tends to distort vertical lines, but Natural Wide keeps everything nice and straight while providing a greater field of view.</p> 
<p>Finally, I tested the Action 6’s new Film Tone feature that borrows a trick from Fujifilm’s simulations. It’s a way to get some fun looks straight out of the camera, like “pristine and cool tones” or “classic negative film type.”. The results are great for anyone who doesn’t want to fiddle with color in post-production, though DJI needs to add a few more options like black and white or sepia.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-updates">Other updates</h2> 
<p>With its bigger sensor the Osmo Action 6 is slightly larger than the Action 5 Pro in all dimensions, but around the same weight at 5.26 ounces. As before, it can connect to up to two DJI wireless microphones at once, including the Mic 2, Mic 3 and Mic Mini. And it comes with DJI’s new dual-latch Quick-Release Adapter Mount that can be attached in either direction, but supports all of DJI’s past accessories.</p> 
<p>Unlike its competition, the Osmo Action 6 comes with 50GB of internal memory (up from 47GB before) along with a microSD card slot. That means you won’t be screwed if you forget a memory card, as most of us have done at one point or another. DJI also doubled the Wi-Fi transfer speeds to 80MB/s and boosted USB-C transfer rates to 800MB/s.</p>

<p>As before, the Action 6 is waterproof to 20 meters (66 feet) by itself, or nearly 200 feet with DJI's waterproof case. And on top of voice control, the Action 6 supports gestures as well, so you can now wave at the camera to start and stop video (like you can with the new <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-2-review-the-best-budget-drone-is-now-even-better-120026045.html">Neo 2</a> drone). With the same 1,950mAh Extreme Battery Plus as before, shooting time between charges is four hours at 1080p and two hours at 4K.</p> 
<p>Finally, DJI has introduced two removable lenses for the Action 6, given DJI some competition in that regard. The first is a macro lens with a minimum focal distance of just 4.3 inches, making it ideal for closeup work and portraits. The other is an FOV expansion lens that boosts the field of view from 155 to 182 degrees.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>With a bigger sensor and larger aperture than the competition, DJI’s Action 6 is now the best action cam on the market for night shooting, delivering clean, sharp video with better stabilization than rivals. It’s also ideal for users who output to both YouTube and TikTok.</p> 
<p>For regular daytime shooting, though, the extra resolution offered on GoPro’s Hero 13 might be preferable for some users. All that aside, it may come down simply to the price. DJI’s Action 6 starts at $369 ($439 with extra batteries and a charger), compared to $309 for the Hero 13 Black and $420 for Insta360’s Ace Pro 2. These are all great choices, but if low-light capability is more important than resolution, choose the Osmo Action 6.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-action-6-review-an-action-camera-that-excels-in-low-light-143027343.html?src=rss]]></description>

We&#39;ve seen loads of great deals popping up around the Internet, including some serious discounts on headphones.

That means you can grab the high-end Beats model for just $170 instead of its usual $350 price tag. This matches the cost we&#39;ve seen for the Studio Pro headphones during other peak shopping times earlier this year, so this might be your last chance to pick them up for this price.</p>

<p>The Beats brand last updated this wireless over-ear headset <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html">in 2023</a>, but it&#39;s still a solid choice for a workhorse pair of headphones. The current model improved audio quality and added a useful Transparency mode, so that you can listen to your tunes and still be aware of the world around you, which is great for settings such as public transit and the gym. The other option is a more immersive active noise-canceling mode. Beats Studio Pro also support lossless audio when wired on a USB-C cable. The official specs say the battery life for the headphones lasts up to 40 hours, or 24 hours when the active noise canceling mode is engaged. If you need to eke more life out of these Beats, they do offer a fast-charging mode that promises four hours of activity from just ten minutes of recharge.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>There are several color options for the Beats Studio Pro, so if there&#39;s a particular hue you want to be sporting, this might be a deal to hop on quickly before the supplies run out or the deal expires.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/snag-a-pair-of-beats-studio-pro-headphones-for-half-off-this-black-friday-140335259.html?src=rss]]></description>

Also, we chat about the Cloudflare issue that took down a huge portion of the web this week, as well as Roblox&#39;s plan to collect kids&#39; selfies for age verification.

However, now across all the major consoles, <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/final-fantasy-tactics-is-getting-a-remake-in-the-ivalice-chronicles-215000718.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">different remake again</a> – and even dismisses some of the characters and additions in War of the Lions. I never finished either version, and two things are apparent: I have missed out, and this is hard.</p><p>Originally released just a few months after <em>Final Fantasy VII,</em> which introduced polygon characters, FMV and more, <em>Tactics</em>’ sprite aesthetic seemed quaint in comparison. With compact isometric levels, turn-based battles are closer<em> to Tactics Ogre </em>and<em> Disgaea </em>than the lineup and strike battles of mainline Final Fantasy games of the time. The game was a critical hit, even if it didn’t match the popularity of Cloud et al.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tactics</em> is far less forgiving. Battle dynamics lean heavily on random number generation; your squad is often outnumbered, and you can easily be undone when resurrection spells and defensive magic fail to land. The first time my revival spell failed, I audibly swore at my Switch 2. But the taste of defeat? It’s usually seasoned just right. It’s gaming umami.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted more, even at the notorious difficulty spike in a battle against knight-gone-wrong Wiegraf. In this fight, I faced him, a far more powerful fighter, solo, and proceeded to die roughly 20 times in a row. On standard difficulty, you rarely have to do this, but I had to craft a specialized version of the protagonist that could hit hard, heal himself, and generally just stay alive long enough for the second stage of this fight.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> can be played in two ways. The modern version features high-resolution sprites, backgrounds, and effects, while retaining the original’s isometric view, which can be rotated and tilted for the best view of the action. There’s an HD-2D nod with a thick depth of field blur to add a more modern feel.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want your <em>Tactics</em> pixelated, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ivalice-chronicles-team-had-to-remake-the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-source-code-from-scratch-190253342.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">you can play the original version</a>, although you can’t transition between the two, which seems like a missed opportunity. (You can toggle your saves across the versions in other RPGs with similar dual versions, like <em>Dragon Quest XI S</em>.)&nbsp;</p><p>More than the graphical downgrade, though, you’re missing out on polished voice acting, which not only elevates the diorama cutscenes and political intrigue but also peppers battles when you field main characters and they unleash certain job class attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking of jobs, <em>Tactics</em>’ system remains the same, with base jobs like knight, white knight and freelancer giving way to dragoons, summoners and, much later,&nbsp; bizarre-but-powerful roles like arithmetician (the power of math!) and ninja.&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty curve of <em>Tactics</em> is very much here. It was embarrassing how much I struggled to overcome spikes in difficulty, but then again, I never finished the original. (And, like a true hero, I refused to research broken job builds or easy grind spots.)</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fft2_8.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fft2_8.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A crystalline attack hits an enemy in an isometric battle." data-uuid="51d1856e-25dd-4c35-a901-c47a6b923f07"><figcaption>A crystalline attack hits an enemy in an isometric battle.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>You can grind, raise levels of your characters, rake in money, and pick up crucial job points. But the wiser method is figuring a battle loop where your characters repeat actions. When the character attacks, heals, steals and generally does anything besides just moving or staying put, it earns Job Points. These are the most crucial parts of growing your squad, as abilities and passive skills can be ported between jobs; it’s how you can customize your entire party to demolish certain kinds of enemies. Lots of archers? A skill called archer’s bane means they’ll struggle to get a hit. Lots of slow-moving enemies in a tight space, rain hell with your summoner, but with an ability to regain MP as they move around.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, it still feels like a slog to repeat battles and garner enough JP for that skill you know will turn the tide of a challenging fight. Fortunately, a new battle speed toggle makes them a little less dull.</p><p>It&#39;s funny to feel nostalgic about a game I never played the first time around. But there’s something familiar and cosy to <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. I’m surprised at the depth of what seems at first to be a pretty simple fighting system.  </p><p>While the voice acting and additional quality-of-life upgrades are great, it’s a shame that Square Enix didn’t include extra jobs (and characters) introduced in other iterations, like the PSP version. Still, it&#39;s another great tactical RPG for the Nintendo Switch, increasingly the best place to play the genre. Fortunately, however, it&#39;s available across PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and PC as well.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-140000972.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony’s still excellent <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478-160045458.html">WH-1000XM5</a> wireless headphones are down to $250 for Black Friday. That’s $150 off the list price and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/sonys-wh-1000xm5-headphones-drop-to-250-for-prime-day-133009798.html">equal</a> to the all-time low (give or take a single cent) we saw on Prime Day. They may no longer be Sony’s flagship noise-canceling headphones, but if the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html">WH-1000XM6</a> are out of your price range, these former Engadget favorites are well worth considering at this heavily reduced price.</p>

<p>We awarded the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 in our 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478-160045458.html">review</a>, praising the supremely comfortable redesign, sound quality and powerful ANC. Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t <em>entirely </em>baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Naturally, the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html">WH-1000XM6</a> that this year replaced the M5 as Sony’s flagship model offers even better sound quality and noise cancellation, while remaining extremely comfortable throughout long listening sessions. But they’re also a lot more expensive at $450 — they&#39;re on sale now for $398 for Black Friday, so you have the option to upgrade to the latest flagship if you&#39;re willing to spend a bit more. However, we still think the XM5 deal is the best value for most people here.</p>

Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p>

<p>If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer.</p>

<p>This is a 12-inch multi-fuel model that can cook with wood or gas. It&#39;s intended for outdoor use and it&#39;s on the lighter side, at 33 pounds. This should make it easy when moving it around the backyard or when taking it to a friend&#39;s house for an impromptu pizza party. To that end, the company sells a luggage-like cover for the oven.</p> 
<p>The interior reaches temperatures up to 950F. This can cook a pizza in around a minute. The only downside here? This is an oven that&#39;s only for outdoor use and, well, winter is coming.

HEVC is a codec that enables the compression of large videos into smaller files while retaining their quality. Sixth-gen Intel Core chips and later, as well as AMD chips made over the past 10 years, come with built-in support for the standard.

However, users with the affected laptops will have to deal with broken videos if they try to play anything on their browsers that use the standard. HP told <em>Ars</em> that it disabled HEVC on select devices way back in 2024 and encouraged people to use “licensed third-party software solutions” instead. Meanwhile, Dell told the publication the its premium laptops still support HEVC videos. For users with base and standard laptops that can no longer play them, the company also encourages the use of third-party software. </p><p>The companies didn’t say why they decided to switch off HEVC playback for certain models, but as <em>Ars</em> notes, it could be associated with increasing licensing fees. After September 30 this year, the royalty rates for the HEVC codec went from 20 cents to 24 cents per unit for over 100,001 units. HP and Dell are two of the largest laptop manufacturers in the world, so that translates to a considerable chunk of money. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/hp-and-dell-cut-hevc-support-in-some-laptops-130000940.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, we don&#39;t get to test out as many fridges as we like simply because they&#39;re large and difficult to move around. That said, now that Samsung has been putting AI inside of its fancy iceboxes for a few years, I wanted to do a long-term review of one of its latest models — <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=48b3f327-6ba9-43ef-96d1-1464c851a9e5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=the+Bespoke+AI+4-door+refrigerator&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9ob21lLWFwcGxpYW5jZXMvcmVmcmlnZXJhdG9ycy9iZXNwb2tlL2Jlc3Bva2UtMjMtY3UtZnQtY291bnRlci1kZXB0aC00LWRvb3ItZnJlbmNoLWRvb3ItcmVmcmlnZXJhdG9yLXdpdGgtYWktZmFtaWx5LWh1Yi1haS12aXNpb24taW5zaWRlLWluLXdoaXRlLWdsYXNzLXJmOTBmMjNhZXdhYS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ4YjNmMzI3LTZiYTktNDNlZi05NmQxLTE0NjRjODUxYTllNSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvaG9tZS1hcHBsaWFuY2VzL3JlZnJpZ2VyYXRvcnMvYmVzcG9rZS9iZXNwb2tlLTIzLWN1LWZ0LWNvdW50ZXItZGVwdGgtNC1kb29yLWZyZW5jaC1kb29yLXJlZnJpZ2VyYXRvci13aXRoLWFpLWZhbWlseS1odWItYWktdmlzaW9uLWluc2lkZS1pbi13aGl0ZS1nbGFzcy1yZjkwZjIzYWV3YWEvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQUgK_3ziLISPI7zouNBfe2HTONKnzBwvk4Sn-xEcV7i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fhome-appliances%2Frefrigerators%2Fbespoke%2Fbespoke-23-cu-ft-counter-depth-4-door-french-door-refrigerator-with-ai-family-hub-ai-vision-inside-in-white-glass-rf90f23aewaa%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/bespoke/bespoke-23-cu-ft-counter-depth-4-door-french-door-refrigerator-with-ai-family-hub-ai-vision-inside-in-white-glass-rf90f23aewaa/">the Bespoke AI 4-door refrigerator</a> — to see firsthand if adding machine learning to an appliance improves its performance. But what I quickly learned is that my favorite thing about the fridge isn&#39;t AI but instead an innovative twist on the traditional water pitcher.&nbsp;</p>

Instead of having a basic water dispenser on the outside of a fridge (which is frankly kind of an eyesore), Samsung moved it behind a thin door. It then added another station right next that big enough to hold a water pitcher that automatically refills itself every time you use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with traditional water dispensers is that they&#39;re too slow. If you&#39;re only filling up a single glass, it&#39;s not a big deal. But if you&#39;re trying to top up a water bottle or get water for the entire family before dinner, you&#39;re often forced to stand in front of the fridge for a few minutes, blocking others from getting in and generally being in people&#39;s way. With the Beverage Center, you still have the option to fill a glass individually, or you can pull the entire pitcher out, carry it over to your table and fill everyone&#39;s cup with haste like a waiter at a restaurant. Sure, this might only save you a few minutes, but when you&#39;re rushing to get dinner done before your kids start getting hangry, every second is precious. After all, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxXDzsl6G5Q" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">six o&#39;clock is dinner time</a> — not 6:05 or 6:10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;d also argue that a pitcher is slightly more elegant than waiting for the weak stream from your water dispenser to lazily fill up a cup. But more importantly, because the whole pitcher is sitting inside a chilled fridge, all of the water is cold — not just the first 12 or 16 ounces you typically get from that little spigot. Also, because there&#39;s a strainer basket, you can even use it to make infused water just by throwing some fruit or herbs in there. And once again, you never need to refill it manually because when the pitcher is empty, you just put it back in the fridge and the next time you grab it, it&#39;s already full again. But don&#39;t just take it from me, there are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1ka3zok/beverage_center_vs_water_dispenser_which_one_is/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">numerous threads</a> where <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1bdij94/update_i_may_be_a_fool_but_i_ordered_a_samsung/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">other users acknowledge</a> the greatness of Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center.</p>

<p>Of course, this feature isn&#39;t perfect. Samsung&#39;s pitcher isn&#39;t dishwasher safe, though that&#39;s not a huge deal because it&#39;s quick and easy to clean with warm soapy water. The bigger issue is that sometimes I wish the pitcher had more capacity or that Samsung offered the option to upgrade to a bigger one. In my experience, 48 ounces is just enough for my family of four, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if people with larger households might want something with more volume.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center feels like one of the ingenious inventions that makes you wonder why another company didn&#39;t think of this sooner. But none did, and because Samsung holds some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9085453B2/en" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">patents related to its automatic water pitcher</a>, you probably won&#39;t see a similar feature on any of its competitors&#39; fridges anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the rest of the fridge and its AI Vision technology, I&#39;m still testing those out, but stay tuned for a full review soon.</p>

These deals offer savings up to $70, depending on what product you choose. The bundles come with a folio case and a Marker stylus.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The reMarkable 2 is covered here and that one topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best E ink tablets</a>. This device offers a great reading and writing experience, with support for Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox. It&#39;s easy to use and the screen looks great.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="33a17e6bbf5c4a20920ed461d2a618ec" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://remarkable.com/shop/black-friday"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The battery lasts around two weeks, which is one of the benefits of this type of display. It supports Wi-Fi and can integrate both PDFs and ePub files. It&#39;s also easy to create your own notebooks that keep track of handwritten notes. To that end, there are eight brush types here to mark up documents and take notes.</p> 
<p>The only major downside of the reMarkable 2 is that it doesn&#39;t ship with the company&#39;s newest Marker Plus stylus. However, this sale lessens that concern. A bundle with the tablet, the Marker Plus and the most simple case costs around $458, whereas the tablet by itself typically costs $399.</p> 
<p>There&#39;s a similar discounted bundle available for the Paper Pro tablet. This knocks $50 off the asking price.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-up-to-70-off-remarkable-tablet-bundles-for-black-friday-133026502.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oura is hosting a Black Friday sale on many of its more popular smart rings. Perhaps the most notable deal is for the Oura Ring 4, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=de1ea3b5-7402-4fde-80db-0cc56ac0a101&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=which+is+down+to+%24249&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL291cmFyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9yaW5ncy9vdXJhLXJpbmctNC9ibGFjayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGUxZWEzYjUtNzQwMi00ZmRlLTgwZGItMGNjNTZhYzBhMTAxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL291cmFyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9yaW5ncy9vdXJhLXJpbmctNC9ibGFjayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT8a1tc_RA8h1l2P4ipM9MrXw86MqJphdWFF_87RYZkU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fouraring.com%2Fstore%2Frings%2Foura-ring-4%2Fblack" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://ouraring.com/store/rings/oura-ring-4/black">which is down to $249</a>. This is a discount of 29 percent, as it typically costs $349. The sale applies to the black colorway.</p> 
<p>The Ring 4 actually topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smart-ring-140000425.html">best smart rings</a>, and with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-long-term-review-out-ahead-of-its-rivals-150047874.html">good reason</a>. It&#39;s comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is always nice. It&#39;s a visually striking ring. We also appreciated the size options, as it fits fingers from size 4 to 15.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="4230c77bde9a4832b1e537e284fd9c3f" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://ouraring.com/store/rings/oura-ring-4/black"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>As for functionality, this smart ring tracks a number of health and fitness metrics. The affiliated app will send out notifications when it thinks you need a rest or to remind you to exercise. It keeps an eye on sleep, heart rate, stress, body temperature, menstrual cycle and a whole lot more. The battery lasts around a week, which is always nice when taking a quick vacation.</p> 
<p>The only downside here, and this applies to all Oura rings, is that many features are locked behind a subscription paywall. This costs $6 a month or $70 per year.</p> 
<p>The company is also selling the gold version of the Ring 4 for $349, which is a discount of $50. The water-resistant Stealth Oura Ring 4 is down to $299, which is a discount of $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/oura-smart-rings-are-up-to-30-percent-off-for-black-friday-123010223.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! As the annual tech discount chaos of Black Friday approaches (good deal <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-action-camera-is-on-sale-for-a-record-low-for-black-friday-160154064.html"><ins>here</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/playstation-2025-black-friday-deals-sony-is-taking-100-off-ps5-consoles-145622303.html"><ins>here</ins></a> and several more <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-are-ready-to-shop-now-ahead-of-the-years-biggest-sale-100052033.html"><ins>here</ins></a>), European policymakers have proposed easing some of the EU’s strictest regulations on artificial intelligence and data privacy. The move aims to remove roadblocks for tech companies and stimulate business growth in the region, potentially marking a major pivot away from the bloc’s reputation as the industry’s toughest regulator.</p>
<p>Changes would allow AI companies to access shared personal data to train their models, while also overhauling GDPR cookie rules. Instead of constant pop-ups, users could set preferences once in their browser and give consent with a single click. (OK, I’m onboard with that.)</p>
<p>Strict rules for “high-risk” AI applications, originally set for next summer, may be delayed until proper support tools are in place. Critics are warning this could be seen as Europe bowing to pressure from Big Tech and political shifts in the US. The proposal now heads to the European Parliament.</p>

<p>A company selling AI-enabled toys suspended sales after a consumer safety report found few restrictions on what its toys would say. The report, by the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, found FoloToy’s products would discuss everything from sexually explicit topics, like BDSM, to “advice on where a child can find matches or knives.” The toys all appear to use OpenAI’s GPT-4o model to respond naturally to children’s questions and comments. Missing from that setup was apparently hard limits on subjects the toys would respond to.</p>
<p>FoloToy has opted to suspend sales of its products while it conducts “a company-wide, end-to-end safety audit across all products.”</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-"></h3>
<p>xAI is once again nuking a bunch of posts from Grok on X after the chatbot made a series of outrageous claims. The company isn’t only cleaning up a bunch of pro-Hitler posts but also a bout of cringe-inducing sycophantic praise for its CEO, Elon Musk. Over the last couple of days, Grok began offering extremely over-the-top opinions about Musk. The bot claimed Musk is the “undisputed pinnacle of holistic fitness” and that he is fitter than LeBron James (hah!). It also said he is smarter than Einstein and would win a fight against Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>Musk is blaming “adversarial prompting” for Grok going off the rails. “Earlier today, Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me,” he wrote. He did not explain how straightforward questions could be considered “adversarial.”</p>

<p>Two years ago, Ooni attempted the indoor pizza-making party with the Volt 12. It had its flaws, but there were enough redeeming features (and interest) to warrant a follow up. The Volt 2 ($699) is a complete overhaul, with a slicker design, which is slightly smaller than the first generation. It’s also cheaper than the original. Read on for the full review.</p>

<p>The Chrono Divide project (via <em>PC Gamer</em>) lets you play the 2000 RTS <em>Red Alert 2</em> in Chrome, Edge or Safari. It even works in mobile browsers. It supports cross-platform multiplayer using all the original maps. <em>Red Alert 2</em>’s single-player campaign modes are still a work in progress for now. The project’s website said: “The end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla <em>Red Alert 2</em> engine.”</p>

The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there&#39;s an option to say if you&#39;re expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn&#39;t offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it&#39;s not for you.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deal-our-favorite-budgeting-app-has-50-percent-off-subscriptions-right-now-160025772.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">one of the strongest in the category</a>. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we&#39;ve tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you&#39;ll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson&#39;s mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you&#39;re looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don&#39;t mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

It even supports cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass and NVIDIA GeForce Now, meaning you can play high-end titles without extra hardware. The combination of OLED contrast, motion clarity and built-in streaming makes it one of the most versatile monitors in Samsung’s lineup.</p>
