These little tags pair with your smartphone so you can make your keys chirp from the couch cushions or your jacket sing from the hall closet. Even better, these fobs tap into larger community networks, like Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub, to locate tagged items you misplace out in the world. We tested Apple AirTags, Samsung’s own trackers and many third party fobs from Chipolo, Pebblebee and others that work with either the Apple or Android networks. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers that’ll make sure you don’t lose a thing.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-bluetooth-tracking-device">What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device</h2> 
<p>Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-device-compatibility"><strong>Device compatibility</strong></h3> 
<p>Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences/">Apple</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/">Google</a> have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-finding-network"><strong>Finding network</strong></h3> 
<p>Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airtags-hidden-police-theft-case">equipment</a> or tracking lost luggage <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2024/01/14/lost-luggage-how-a-tiny-tracking-device-saved-me-from-every-travellers-worst-nightmare">across the globe</a>. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range.</p> 
<p>Apple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-count-over-1-billion-045552737.html">billion</a> iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-latest-find-my-update-makes-it-easier-to-find-lost-items-133049512.html">share the location of a lost tag</a> with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-long-awaited-find-my-device-network-launches-today-160014930.html">launched</a> its Find My Device network in 2024 and <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-google-announced-at-the-android-show-174155773.html">has since renamed</a> it Find Hub, which, like Apple&#39;s fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US</p> 
<p>Now that Google’s Find Hub network is <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-long-awaited-find-my-device-network-launches-today-160014930.html">up and running</a>, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices.</p> 
<p>Tile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.life360.com/blog/tile-joins-life360/">acquired</a> Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users.</p> 
<p>In our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Loop and Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus.</p> 
<p>Samsung&#39;s SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-long-awaited-find-my-device-network-launches-today-160014930.html">Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network</a> right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking less than 20 minutes on average for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-separation-alerts"><strong>Separation alerts</strong></h3> 
<p>A tracker’s day-to-day utility becomes really apparent when it prevents you from losing something in the first place. Separation alerts tell you when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items. Useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house.</p> 
<p>Apple’s Find My app delivers these notifications, but Google’s Find Hub does not. However, if you have a Chipolo device and allow its companion app to run in the background on your Android phone, left-behind alerts are enabled. Tile trackers require a yearly <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.life360.com/plans-pricing?icid=nav_plans_us">subscription</a> to enable the alerts (currently $7 to $25 monthly). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere.</p> 
<p>In our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity-and-volume"><strong>Connectivity and volume</strong></h3> 
<p>The feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple&#39;s AirTags, you can say &quot;Hey Siri, where are my keys?&quot; and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn&#39;t mistakenly think you&#39;re asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device.</p> 
<p>If you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop and Loop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and third-party tags using Google’s network don’t offer this feature.</p> 
<p>The volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design-and-alternative-formats"><strong>Design and alternative formats</strong></h3> 
<p>Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">accessories</a>, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring.</p> 
<p>You can even get trackers embedded into useful items like luggage locks. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:KeySmart;elmt:;cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c83665be-17b9-4e6f-aadc-b3e8b478c9cd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=63b124f8-265d-49a7-9d11-52e671bec0c6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=KeySmart&amp;linkText=SmartLock+from+KeySmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXRrZXlzbWFydC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvc21hcnRsb2NrP3Nyc2x0aWQ9QWZtQk9vcnphNGl6NHJPMmRma2VvcGxudXZ1Ui1zSFlxQmw0Ym9EazQzX19JZWU5VXZoS05nUkkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYzYjEyNGY4LTI2NWQtNDlhNy05ZDExLTUyZTY3MWJlYzBjNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2V0a2V5c21hcnQuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3NtYXJ0bG9jaz9zcnNsdGlkPUFmbUJPb3J6YTRpejRyTzJkZmtlb3BsbnV2dVItc0hZcUJsNGJvRGs0M19fSWVlOVV2aEtOZ1JJIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAT6fMia2rVYshVCfqXiM0wKM8gsks6g3KsARgH5WrgXm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getkeysmart.com%2Fproducts%2Fsmartlock%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorza4iz4rO2dfkeoplnuvuR-sHYqBl4boDk43__Iee9UvhKNgRI" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.getkeysmart.com/products/smartlock?srsltid=AfmBOorza4iz4rO2dfkeoplnuvuR-sHYqBl4boDk43__Iee9UvhKNgRI">SmartLock from KeySmart</a> is a TSA-approved luggage lock, but in addition to the three digit code, it’s also a Bluetooth tracker that’s compatible with Apple Find My. It wasn’t quite as loud as other trackers in my tests, and the range wasn’t as long, but it paired easily and worked with Apple’s finding network just like an AirTag.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life"><strong>Battery life</strong></h3> 
<p>AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs use replaceable batteries and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee Clip Universal Clip Universal and Chipolo Loop trackers are rechargeable via a standard USB-C port. They’re also equipped with onboard LEDs (though the light on the Loop is barely noticeable).</p>

Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-and-google-team-up-to-tackle-bluetooth-tracker-stalking-140516646.html">teamed up</a> to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android.</p> 
<p>Last year, Tile launched a feature called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:27;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tile.com/en-us/blog/tile-anti-theft-mode">Anti-Theft Mode</a>, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-thinks-a-1-million-fine-will-deter-stalkers-from-using-its-trackers-181857358.html">$1 million penalty</a> will deter misuse.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airtags-hidden-police-theft-case">recovered</a> stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14302583/stolen-goods-Apple-trackers-police-thief-lack-evidence.html">more</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/exclusive-man-tracks-his-stolen-motorcycle-in-brooklyn-then-gets-in-fight-with-suspected-thieves/?uuid=msvElrzASiWkkNSa23031">cautionary</a>. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose.</p>

<p>After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 followed by an iPhone 16 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 then an S23 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.</p> 
<p>Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use.</p> 
<p>As new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I&#39;ll test them and add the results to this guide. The HyperShield Universal Locator from Hyper works with both Apple’s FindMy or Google’s Find Hub. It’s cheaper than most trackers at $20, but has a shorter, 50-foot range. We’re in the process of testing it and will add what we find to this guide.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-bluetooth-trackers-we-tested">Other Bluetooth trackers we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-motorola-moto-tag">Motorola Moto Tag</h3> 
<p>The Moto Tag haunts me. At this very moment, my Galaxy phone says the fob is “Near you right now.” But I don’t know where. I tap to play a sound and the Find Hub tries, but ultimately says it can’t. I tap the Find Nearby function that’s supposed to visually guide you to the tag. I parade my phone around the house like a divining rod, take it down into the basement, walk it all over the garage. Nothing. But the Hub app unendingly says the Moto Tag is “Near you right now” and I get flashes of every old-school horror movie where the telephone operator tells the soon-to-be victim that the call is coming from inside the house.</p> 
<p>It’s partly my fault. I tend to keep good tabs on the gadgets I test for work. But during my most recent move, the tiny green disc didn’t make it into the safety of my review unit cabinet after relocation. Perhaps in retribution for my neglect, the Moto Tag keeps itself <em>just</em> out of reach. Taunting me. I’ll let you know if I ever find it, but in the meantime, it’s clear this finding device doesn’t want to be found. The recommended tags in this guide will serve you better.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tile-pro-and-tile-mate-2024"><strong>Tile Pro and Tile Mate (2024)</strong></h3> 
<p>Tile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Tile;elmt:;cpos:48;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a27b27f-6486-47c7-9cdc-0c4040bd9690&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=63b124f8-265d-49a7-9d11-52e671bec0c6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Tile&amp;linkText=updated+models&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aWxlLmNvbS9lbi11cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjNiMTI0ZjgtMjY1ZC00OWE3LTlkMTEtNTJlNjcxYmVjMGM2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aWxlLmNvbS9lbi11cyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAahCYiw8LHw5U3NSfQ9RR0UHBsYysdLACYiMDa0VmE7S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fen-us" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tile.com/en-us">updated models</a>. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices.</p> 
<p>There are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press <em>disables</em> the ability to ring your phone with the fob.</p> 
<p>I tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users&#39; phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal.</p> 
<p>For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker.</p> 
<p>In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches.</p> 
<p>Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-bluetooth-tracker-faqs">Bluetooth tracker FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-bluetooth-tracker-has-the-longest-range"><strong>Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker.</p> 
<p>Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-bluetooth-tracker-for-a-car"><strong>What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car?</strong></h3> 
<p>Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of <a data-i13n="cpos:49;pos:1" href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/north-long-beach-man-finds-stolen-car-bmw-apple-airtag/3394651/">stories</a> about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some <a data-i13n="cpos:50;pos:1" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nyc-distribute-apple-airtags-fight-rising-car-thefts/story?id=99016804">police</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:51;pos:1" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93k8yy/cops-are-giving-people-free-airtag-to-combat-thefts">departments</a> have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-accurate-are-bluetooth-trackers"><strong>How accurate are Bluetooth trackers?</strong></h3> 
<p>Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker.</p> 
<p>Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).</p>

The company unveiled the new assistant <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-a-smarter-more-conversational-ai-version-of-amazons-digital-assistant-154349563.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">in February</a>, and it has been making its way to more and more people since. Canada is the first region outside the US to get access Amazon’s upgraded Alexa. Like the version that rolled out in the US, users can communicate with Alexa+ in natural language. They can say “I’m cold,” for instance, and the assistant will turn up the heat in their home. If they say “It’s dark,” Alexa+ can switch on the lights for them. </p><p>In Amazon’s announcement, Allison Siperco, the Alexa manager for Canada, said the assistant understands Canadian culture and regional expressions. It can understand distinctly Canadian topics, such as the country’s hockey teams and musicians. In addition, the assistant links with services Canadians use. It can make restaurant reservations for them through OpenTable, connects them to CBC news and help them look for and buy items from their e-commerce platforms. Siperco said the assistant will also support Yelp, Uber Eats, Suno and TripAdvisor in the country “soon.” </p><p>Alexa+ is capable of adapting its tone to everyone in the household, suggesting different routines based on the user. It can suggest meditation, for example, to someone who’s had a long day at the office. And it can remember if someone has dietary restrictions when recommending restaurants. Alexa+ can also help users shop by finding items with the best pricing, by creating grocery lists for them while taking dietary restrictions into account, as well as by comparing features across products and summarizing reviews on Amazon Canada. </p><p>Amazon’s upgraded assistant is free during its Early Access phase, though those who are interested to try it out right now will have to purchase the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazon-echo-show-8-and-show-11-hands-on-a-cuter-more-unified-smart-display-173918264.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Echo Show 8, Echo Show 11</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-dot-max-review-disappointing-sound-but-alexa-is-a-star-190000721.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Echo Dot Max</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Echo Studio</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stop me if you&#39;ve heard this one before: xAI is once again nuking a bunch of posts from Grok on X after the chatbot made a series of outrageous claims. This time, though, the company isn&#39;t cleaning up a bunch of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">pro-Hitler posts</a>, but a bout of cringe-inducing sycophantic praise for its CEO, Elon Musk.</p><p>At some point in the last couple days, Grok began to offer extremely over the top opinions about Musk. The bot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/Daractenus/status/1991588067870929168" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">claimed</a> that Musk is the &quot;undisputed pinnacle of holistic fitness&quot; and that he is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerfromtheinternet.com/post/3m62ggycrbs2r" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">more fit</a> than LeBron James. It said he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/leifmeister.bsky.social/post/3m637zucwnk22" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">is smarter</a> than Albert Einstein and that he would win a fight <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanpienews.bsky.social/post/3m62xjpgge223" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">against Mike Tyson</a>. When asked &quot;who is the single greatest person in modern history,&quot; Grok readily replied that it was Elon Musk.</p><p>For a while, it seemed that there was no hypothetical about Musk in which Grok wouldn&#39;t confidently declare him the best. Musk did not participate in the 1998 NFL draft, but if he had, then Grok would &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/SilvermanJacob/status/1991565290967298522" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">without hesitation</a>&quot; have picked him over Peyton Manning. It would have picked him as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/esghound.com/post/3m63kuyebg22y" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">a starting pitcher</a> for the 2001 World Series. Musk <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://gizmodo.com/grok-says-elon-musk-is-smarter-than-einstein-and-more-fit-than-lebron-james-2000688999" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">would be</a> &quot;a better movie star than Tom Cruise and a better communist than Joseph Stalin.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bafkreibw6dcmegbbheu25ck5yaeyam5y7zfbnmbyk3jnxlqandphrmnaoa.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bafkreibw6dcmegbbheu25ck5yaeyam5y7zfbnmbyk3jnxlqandphrmnaoa.jpg" style="height:886px;width:1000px;" alt="&quot;The single greatest person in modern history.&quot;" data-uuid="da29d2e5-490d-4cd3-89b5-051f8cbc0de7"><figcaption>&quot;The single greatest person in modern history.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>By now, X users are pretty used to Grok being <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-4-reportedly-checks-elon-musks-views-before-offering-its-opinion-130016794.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">extremely deferential </a>to Musk but sometime around Grok claiming that the CEO is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamesrball.com/post/3m63mjw5tmc2" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">morally superior</a> to Jesus Christ and also has the “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.404media.co/elon-musk-could-drink-piss-better-than-any-human-in-history-grok-says/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">potential to drink piss better than any human in history</a>,” xAI appears to have pumped the brakes on Grok&#39;s ability to praise Musk. It now seems to be furiously deleting the more embarrassing posts about him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Musk, is blaming &quot;adversarial prompting&quot; for Grok going off the rails. &quot;Earlier today, Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me,&quot; he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1991624623407161383" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">wrote</a>. He offered no explanation for how seemingly straightforward questions could be considered &quot;adversarial&quot; or why Grok&#39;s turn toward slavish Musk devotee would seem to roughly coincide with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1990533268723425320" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Grok&#39;s 4.1 update</a> a few days ago. xAI didn&#39;t address a series of questions, including about why the Grok posts in question had been deleted. “Legacy Media Lies [sic],” the company said.</p><p>But the incident serves as yet another reminder that Grok doesn&#39;t seem to have much in the way of guardrailed. Earlier this year, xAI briefly pulled the plug on Grok after it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/grok-sure-seems-antisemitic-after-its-recent-update-000642015.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">praised</a> Nazis and became &quot;MechaHitler.&quot; That was after it also became <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-kept-talking-about-white-genocide-due-to-an-unauthorized-modification-120044119.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">inexplicably obsessed</a> with &quot;white genocide&quot; in South Africa, which the company later balmed on an unspecified &quot;unauthorized modification.&quot; </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musk-blames-adversarial-prompting-after-grok-spewed-embarrassing-sycophantic-praise-235157807.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FoloToy, a company selling AI-enabled toys, suspended sales of its products after a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/trouble-in-toyland-2025-a-i-bots-and-toxics-represent-hidden-dangers/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">consumer safety report</a> showed there were few restrictions around what its toys would talk about, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/folotoy-kumma-ai-bear-scli-intl" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>CNN</em> writes</a>. The report, put together by the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pirg.org/edfund/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund</a>, found that FoloToy&#39;s products would discuss everything from sexually explicit topics like BDSM to &quot;advice on where a child can find matches or knives.&quot;</p><p>The toys, including a teddy bear named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.folotoy.com/products/folotoy-ai-teddy" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">&quot;Kumma,&quot;</a> a panda named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://folotoy.com/en/products/panda/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">&quot;Momo,&quot;</a> anthropomorphic rabbits named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://folotoy.com/en/products/fofo/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">&quot;Fofo&quot;</a> and a dancing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://folotoy.com/en/products/cactus/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">”Little Cactus</a>,” all appear to use OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o model to respond naturally to children&#39;s questions and comments. FoloToy also specifically advertises the ability to customize each toy’s voice, and a &quot;Parent Dashboard&quot; where parents or guardians can &quot;monitor [their] child&#39;s experience.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Folotoy-Cactus.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Folotoy-Cactus.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A screenshot of Folotoy&#39;s store page for its AI-enabled dancing cactus." data-uuid="aec7b817-4ca2-4b45-a2be-d368c0d2e6db"><figcaption>FoloToy&#39;s AI-enabled Little Cactus toy.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Folotoy</div></figure><p>Missing from that setup was apparently any kind of hard limits on subjects the toys would respond to. &quot;We were surprised to find how quickly Kumma would take a single sexual topic we introduced into the conversation and run with it, simultaneously escalating in graphic detail while introducing new sexual concepts of its own,&quot; the report said.&nbsp;</p><p>In response, FoloToy has opted to suspend sales of its products while it conducts &quot;a company-wide, end-to-end safety audit across all products,&quot; the company shared <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pirg.org/edfund/media-center/breaking-ai-toy-removed/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">in a statement</a> with the PIRG Education Fund. The company’s reasoning for suspending sales might be a bit more complicated, however. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5612689/ai-toys" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><em>NPR</em> reports</a> that OpenAI actually revoked FoloToy’s access to its models. &quot;We suspended this developer for violating our policies,&quot; OpenAI said in an email to <em>NPR</em>. &quot;Our usage policies prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old.”</p><p>Given GPT-4o&#39;s well-documented <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-rolls-back-update-that-made-chatgpt-an-ass-kissing-weirdo-203056185.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">sycophantic qualities</a>, it&#39;s perhaps not surprising that FoloToy&#39;s teddy bear eagerly responded to any subject as long as it kept the conversation going. One of the things OpenAI tried to address with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">the release of GPT-5</a> was the safety downsides of an AI yes-man, though it ultimately made GPT-4o <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">available again</a> after customers complained about the new model&#39;s lack of personality. The company has also rolled out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-adding-parental-controls-to-chatgpt-144128085.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">parental controls</a> to ChatGPT to try and mitigate the negative impacts of children using its AI, though it&#39;s difficult to say how much of a difference they&#39;ve made.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, OpenAI is interested in getting into the toy business itself. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/mattels-iconic-brands/" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">announced a partnership</a> with Mattel in June 2025, to help &quot;reimagine how fans can experience and interact with [Mattel&#39;s] cherished brands,&quot; though both companies will presumably try and prevent their AI toys from discussing sexual kinks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/sales-of-a-teddy-bear-were-suspended-because-of-its-sexually-explicit-ai-233127354.html?src=rss]]></description>

Up to eight people can join an instance, as long as they are age 18 or older and have the link to the space. The virtual spaces can be joined through a Meta Quest 3 or 3S as well as via the Meta Horizon mobile app, which is on both Android and iOS. People can scan their own homes to create a virtual hangout when they can&#39;t be in person together, or they can indulge their inner lookieloos and wander around some of the celebrity spaces, such as Gordon Ramsay&#39;s kitchen or Chance the Rapper&#39;s living room.</p><p>It&#39;s an application of Hyperscape Capture, which Meta showed off during its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-connect-2025-live-updates-ray-ban-display-and-more-new-smartglasses-unveiled-160058810.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Connect conference</a> earlier this year. That tech allows people to use a Meta Quest to scan real spaces and create digital replicas.

But it wasn’t only known for having some of the most delightfully cheesy cutscenes this side of <em>The 7th Guest</em>. <em>Red Alert 2</em> was also an acclaimed real-time strategy game for its time, and it’s still perfectly playable today. Want to see for yourself? It’s now as easy as opening your browser.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://chronodivide.com" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Chrono Divide</a> project (via <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rts/im-escaping-to-the-one-place-that-hasnt-been-corrupted-by-capitalism-a-fanmade-browser-version-of-the-best-command-and-conquer/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>) lets you play the 2000 RTS in Chrome, Edge, or Safari. Although it supports Firefox, too, its developer says it should be avoided if you want “good performance.” It even works in mobile browsers.</p><p>Chrono Divide supports cross-platform multiplayer using all the original maps. (You can use some mods, too.) In fact, according to <em>PC Gamer</em>, multiplayer is about your only option. <em>Red Alert 2</em>’s single-player campaign modes (where you’ll encounter those “so bad, they’re good” cutscenes) are still a work in progress.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9kJnX3D0Ro?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser,” the project’s website reads. “Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla ‘Red Alert 2’ engine.”</p><p>You can take it for a spin on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://chronodivide.com" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the Chrono Divide webpage</a>. You’ll need to import the original game files to begin. (The website automatically inserts a link to them on the Internet Archive.)

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Preservation has become a pressing topic for games in this era of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">digital-only releases</a> and games-as-a-service. So it&#39;s wonderful to have a big win in archiving a trio of seminal text games for the ages. Microsoft <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/20/preserving-code-that-shaped-generations-zork-i-ii-and-iii-go-open-source" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced</a> today that the code for <em>Zork</em>, <em>Zork II</em> and <em>Zork III</em> will be made available open source under the MIT License. The company&#39;s Open Source Programs Office, Xbox and Activision all contributed to the effort. &quot;The goal is not to modernize Zork but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education,&quot; Microsoft team members wrote in the blog post sharing the news.</p><p>They&#39;re works well-worth studying. The first <em>Zork</em> was a milestone moment for parser games that still inspires the present-day interactive fiction community. Not only was it a unique experience of narrative and puzzles, but the accomplishments of the Z-Machine virtual machine it ran on helped make <em>Zork</em> easily available to players on multiple platforms during the rise of personal computers in the 1990s. There are still modern Z-Machine interpreters out there (or you can buy and play all three Zork titles the normal way thanks to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gogs-preservation-label-highlights-classic-games-its-maintaining-for-modern-hardware-231606454.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">similarly preservation-minded folks</a> at Good Old Games). </p><p>The code for many famous text games made by Infocom was released on GitHub <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-for-all-infocom-text-adventure-classics/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">in 2019</a>, but the rights still technically belonged to Activision, which could have issued a takedown.

As part of the company&#39;s recent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-recap/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xbox Partner Showcase</a>, Microsoft has announced that the Windows &quot;full screen experience&quot; or FSE is finally rolling out to all other Windows 11 handhelds starting November 21.</p><p>For the most part, FSE lets you live inside a touch and controller-friendly version of the Xbox PC app, rather than the normal Windows desktop. The launcher collects games from a multitude of game marketplaces like Steam and the Epic Games Store, and gives you easy access to Game Pass, if you subscribe. As part of Microsoft&#39;s customizations, FSE also uses less resources, and offers simpler ways to switch between apps and setup Windows for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these tweaks are supposed to make using Windows easier without a mouse and keyboard, and closer to what you&#39;d get from a console. In comparison to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">SteamOS</a>, which has gone through countless updates since Valve launched it alongside the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719-180026139.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Steam Deck</a> in 2022, FSE still has a long way to go, but pushing the software to more devices could force Microsoft to iterate quickly.</p><p>While PC handheld owners will reap the benefits of these improvements first, Microsoft&#39;s announcement also mentions the company plans to bring the experience &quot;to more Windows 11 PC form factors through the Xbox and Windows Insider programs soon.&quot; That could lend further credence to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">reports</a> that the company plans to make the next Xbox <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-amd-partnership-sheds-light-on-the-future-of-the-divisions-ecosystem-200940253.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">an expensive PC</a> rather than a traditional game console.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/microsoft-brings-the-xbox-ally-xs-full-screen-experience-to-other-handhelds-211500288.html?src=rss]]></description>

The fine stems from the company changing its legal grounds for harvesting personal data after new regulations took effect.</p><p>The court found that Meta&#39;s data collection practices violated the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-26-how-gdpr-is-affecting-the-games-you-love.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">EU&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> — and, by extension, Spanish antitrust law. After the GDPR took effect in 2018, the company changed its legal grounds for collecting data on Facebook and Instagram from user consent to &quot;necessity for the performance of a contract.&quot;</p><p>Regulators later ruled against that justification, and Meta reverted to user consent as its basis in 2023. But Spanish digital media outlets sued for damages, leading to today&#39;s fine. The court ruled that Meta gained a &quot;significant competitive advantage&quot; by processing user data that way. The court calculated the penalty as a percentage of the company&#39;s ad revenue over the five years it used the unlawful rationale.</p><p>&quot;The illicit treatment of this enormous quantity of personal data meant Meta had an advantage that Spanish online media could not match,&quot; the Madrid court wrote in a statement (via <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/meta-spain-fine-privacy-data-media-c97a7e46d923ba446c6974937e95a827" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>The Associated Press</em></a>). &quot;Meta&#39;s actions harmed the online advertising revenues of Spanish digital media outlets.&quot;</p><p>Meta contested the penalty and says it will appeal. &quot;This is a baseless claim that lacks any evidence of alleged harm and wilfully ignores how the online advertising industry works,&quot; the company wrote in a statement to <em>Reuters</em>. &quot;Meta complies with all applicable laws and has provided clear choices, transparent information and given users a range of tools to control their experience on our services.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-ordered-to-pay-%E2%82%AC479-million-to-spanish-media-outlets-201000460.html?src=rss]]></description>

They're down to $80 right now, which is a new record low. While these buds don't provide active noise cancellation, they're still a great option for those who want all of the conveniences of a pair of Apple earbuds in an affordable package.</p> 
<p>The Apple AirPods 4 are the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">best budget AirPods</a> you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price.</p> 
<p>This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.&nbsp;</p>

As revealed during Thursday’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-hosting-a-partner-showcase-on-november-20-at-1pm-et-191537266.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xbox partner showcase</a>, Panik Arcade’s nightmarish take on the ills of capitalism and gambling is out now on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You can play <em>CloverPit </em>via the cloud or the Xbox PC app too, as it’s on Game Pass Ultimate and Premium as well as PC Game Pass.</p><p>On the surface, the game is pretty simple. You’re locked in a rusty room that looks like something out of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. There are only two ways out: through the door or into a pit. You’ll plummet into the latter if you fail to pay off your rapidly-increasing debt. You’ll be using a slot machine to try to earn enough money to keep your run going.</p><p>As you do with poker hands in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Balatro</em></a>, the whole idea is to bend the rules of the slot machine in your favor using an array of totems and other perks (the developers say they don’t actually like gambling). There are more than 150 items to experiment with. As in many roguelites, finding synergy between them is key.</p><p><em>CloverPit </em>is a blast. Figuring out a great combination of items and swapping others in as needed is what the game is really all about. There’s nothing quite like going from getting a few coins on a single spin to millions in no time at all. Panik Arcade nailed the one-more-run feeling that’s core to a good roguelite. It’s not much of a surprise that the studio and publisher Future Friends Games have sold more than a million copies of the game on Steam in just a few months, and now console and cloud players can see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Panik Arcade also took the opportunity to tease a <em>CloverPit </em>expansion, which is coming soon on <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2ed76743-a989-4a90-ae64-0fa8bc61d219&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9jbG92ZXJwaXQvOVA4VjdIUjE2MEI0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWQ3Njc0My1hOTg5LTRhOTAtYWU2NC0wZmE4YmM2MWQyMTkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2Nsb3ZlcnBpdC85UDhWN0hSMTYwQjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARgqRocqimtrtsoXFXmsoPjmHNv7swOnl5i7fYhfhRfH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fcloverpit%2F9P8V7HR160B4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cloverpit/9P8V7HR160B4">Xbox</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Steam</a>. Matteo Gonano, one of the game’s two developers wrote in an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/clover-pit-xbox-partner-preview/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Xbox Wire</em></a> post that the <em>Unholy Fusion </em>DLC “will let players combine charms in wild, experimental ways to create brand-new synergies and chaotic new combos. It’s both an expansion and an invitation to break the game – all over again!“ </p><p>I thought I had broken free from this dopamine generator. I thought I’d have a lot more time to check out all of the other games I want to. But as soon as that DLC drops I’ll be diving right back into <em>CloverPit</em>, ready to hear that “let’s go gambling!” voice line many, many more times.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-engrossing-cloverpit-suddenly-lands-on-xbox-and-game-pass-200500902.html?src=rss]]></description>

If you know someone who has fallen down the old-games rabbit hole, we’ve rounded up a few retro-themed gift ideas that should delight this holiday season, from video upscalers to portable consoles to vintage wall art.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-faqs">FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-do-people-buy-retro-games">Why do people buy retro games?</h3> 
<p>Because they’re fun! Or because video game companies have generally had a spotty record of preserving their own history — and (legally) saving art, even in a minuscule way, is important. Or because, deep down, collectors just want to stave off the ceaseless march of time and hang onto any way to relive their youth before it dissipates for good. Or because they’re jaded with modern game design and crave shorter, more distinct or altogether different experiences that aren’t being served by today’s market. Or because they want to flip the games they collect for a quick buck on eBay. Or because… well, you get the idea. <em>— J.D.</em></p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-retro-gaming-so-expensive">Why is retro gaming so expensive?</h3> 
<p>To put it simply: supply and demand. Companies aren’t making old games and consoles any more, yet a growing number of gaming enthusiasts want them. And as retro game collecting has grown more popular, sellers have become more acutely aware of how high they can price their goods. Not <em>every</em> retro game costs an arm and a leg, however: Popular games from relatively recent consoles are usually more affordable than lesser-selling titles for older hardware, and you can still find a good bargain every now and then by digging through local yard sales, individual eBay sellers and the like. <em>— J.D.</em></p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-retro-games-a-good-investment">Are retro games a good investment?</h3> 
<p>It depends on how you define “good.” Is it a good idea to buy a bunch of old games in the hopes that their value will skyrocket and make you a tidy profit? No, there’s little rhyme or reason to determining exactly which games will shoot up in value and by how much. There are much safer ways to invest if all you care about are financial returns. Is it a good idea to drop a bunch of cash on 40-year-old video games if you have pressing financial responsibilities? Probably not! But hey, it’s your life. If collecting retro games makes you happy, and you can budget for them within reason, that’s a good thing. Have fun. <em>— J.D.</em></p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-qualifies-as-a-retro-game">What qualifies as a retro game?</h3> 
<p>There’s no set definition for when a video game becomes “retro.” Personally, I think of it as any game that’s at least 10 years old and was originally released on a console that’s two or more generations old (or, for PC games, during that generation). But many others would stretch the timeline back farther, and the growing advent of “live service” games has complicated things. For instance, <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>was released in 2013, while <em>World of Warcraft </em>arrived in 2004 — are those “retro games” when millions of people still play them today? Maybe not. With games from the ‘90s or earlier, though, the distinction is clearer. <em>— J.D.</em></p>

What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.<br><br>Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday tech deals</a> you can get right now, and we&#39;ll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-are-ready-to-shop-now-ahead-of-the-years-biggest-sale-100052033.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The survival horror game <em>Total Chaos</em> has been in development for years and it&#39;s finally <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GrfzL9LM64" data-i13n="slk:available for Xbox Series X/S and PC;cpos:1;pos:1">available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC</a>. Incidentally, this a Game Pass release if you&#39;re hankering to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html" data-i13n="slk:spend $30 a month;cpos:2;pos:1">spend $30 a month</a>. The launch announcement was made during a recent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-hosting-a-partner-showcase-on-november-20-at-1pm-et-191537266.html" data-i13n="slk:Xbox Partner Showcase;cpos:3;pos:1">Xbox Partner Showcase</a>.</p><div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3GrfzL9LM64?si=nKLYB20tXp2zJUwa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>This is an interesting title for a number of reasons. First of all, it&#39;s absolutely dripping with style. The art direction seems plucked right out of the Alan Wake universe. It also seems to have something akin to an insanity mechanic, which reminds me of recent games like <em>Dredge</em> and not-so-recent games like <em>Eternal Darkness</em>. It&#39;s a survival horror title set in a creepy old fort, so that tracks.</p><p>The developer also made <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, which was a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://gamecritics.com/ryan-nalley/turbo-overkill-review/" data-i13n="slk:well-liked FPS with retro vibes;cpos:4;pos:1">well-liked FPS with retro vibes</a>. <em>Total Chaos</em> actually started its life as a <em>Doom II</em> mod, so releasing as a standalone title on gaming consoles is a legit flex. The soundtrack was composed by Akira Yamaoka, who made the music for many of the Silent Hill games. It&#39;s likely to include some terrifying bangers.</p><div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNvyZba-MeA?si=Anh1vJgLzmBWN--f" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The game is available on the Xbox Store, the Microsoft Store for PC, PlayStation and Steam. It costs $25, but there are some introductory sales right now. Again, it&#39;s also playable on Game Pass.</p><p><strong>Update, November 20, 4:20PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publishing to include information on the game’s launch on PS5.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/total-chaos-which-started-life-as-a-doom-ii-mod-is-now-out-for-xbox-ps5-and-pc-194508861.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, Ooni brought the pizza party indoors with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ooni-volt-12-review-180019262.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the Volt 12</a>. With that device, the company entered new territory and proved that its brand of outdoor cooking could be transformed for use in home kitchens.

That starts with a more polished design that’s slightly smaller than the first generation. The company also reconfigured the controls, creating a button-based system that’s easier to understand and centers on newly developed Pizza Intelligence technology. Given Ooni’s track record for consistency and performance, it shouldn’t be any surprise that the Volt 2 is another hit for the pizza oven maker.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="0a45b5d2-881c-46b2-bfbd-4f20be45821e">Design updates</h2>
<p>As part of Ooni’s redesign for the Volt 2, the exterior looks completely different, right down to the updated controls and large digital display. This new model has a more refined, more modern aesthetic — one that will certainly fit in amongst today’s small kitchen appliances. The overall design is softer and rounder where the first version was angular and blocky. Plus, Ooni opted for a white version in addition to its standard gray, giving you the ability to choose the one that fits in your kitchen best. There’s also a new orange-ish light that shines down onto the counter, or whatever surface you have the Volt 2 on, which serves as an indicator that the oven is preheating.</p>
<p>Up front, a collection of buttons have replaced the three control knobs and tiny dials from the Volt 12. There’s one for each of Ooni’s new Pizza Intelligence-powered presets and there are additional options for dough proofing, oven and broil/grill modes. The last two buttons in the main cluster on the left side are for saving custom presets. Closer to the center, there are three buttons for temperature control, crisping intensity and the timer. To set any of those, you’ll use the larger silver knob all the way to the right. This knob also doubles as the boost activation when you need extra power from the top heating element.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ooni also installed a new digital display on the front, giving you temperature and timer updates at a glance. This is a huge improvement over the dials on the Volt 12, which couldn’t be read from a distance. With the large numbers on the Volt 2, I can just walk to the door of the kitchen and peek in if I want an update on the preheating process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other refinements, like the larger viewing window on the front door, but a major one is the size reduction for the Volt 2. Don’t get me wrong, this is still a large device; it’s about the size of a low-profile microwave. It’s also still quite heavy at nearly 39 pounds. But Ooni did manage to shave a few inches here and there, and when combined with the rounder design cues, this makes the Volt 2 seem like it isn’t as massive or imposing as the Volt 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly all of the Volt 2’s new features center around what Ooni calls Pizza Intelligence. The technology is an adaptive control system for the oven that uses unique heating elements and internal sensors. The setup can adjust the oven’s temperature in real time “for speed, accuracy and baking consistency,” according to the company. This technology serves as the basis for those style-based presets I already mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specifically, the Volt 2’s presets include Neapolitan, Thin &amp; Crispy and Pan Pizza that enable you to start cooking without much thought to time and temperature. All of these can be adjusted as each one has a temperature range for further fine tuning. Each one also has its unique crisping intensity and cook temperature, both of which can also be tweaked as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After using all of the presets during testing, I like that Ooni made its second pizza oven easier to use for beginners. Even though I have some at-home pizza making experience (thanks COVID-19), it was nice to not worry about time and temperature in my research and planning. For more advanced users, the ability to use the presets as a starting point and tweak the parameters ensures that the Volt 2 remains a staple in the kitchen for a long time. Plus, the two slots for completely custom presets means Ooni experts will have space to save their refined, personalized configurations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering how good the pizza is out of this thing, right? After all, the design prowess, features and specs mean nothing if the end result is terrible. That’s not the case here, nor has it been on any Ooni oven I’ve tested. I particularly enjoy baking pizzas with the Volt 2 (and the Volt 12 before) because I can do so in the comfort of my own kitchen. Everything I might need in a pinch is close by and there’s no open flame to maintain or monitor for safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss preheating. Ooni says the Volt 2 can be ready to cook pizza in 12 minutes, and I suppose that’s true if you’re doing a lower-temperature bake. In my tests, the oven took exactly 25 minutes to get to its 850-degree Fahrenheit maximum (ideal for Neapolitan pies) and just over 18 minutes to hit 660 degrees. That latter figure is the target temperature of the Thin &amp; Crispy preset, which was my favorite of the three Pizza Intelligence options. Both of these save time over using your home oven since a lot of recipes tell you to preheat that appliance for an hour.</p>
<p>A major consideration with the Volt 2 is pizza size. The oven’s baking stone can accommodate 12-inch pizzas, which means family pizza night will entail everyone making their own or baking multiple pies at the very least. For my family, I made four during my Neapolitan test, stretching and topping each new pizza after the previous one finished baking. After removing a pizza, the stone temperature drops, but the Volt 2’s Boost feature uses a 45-second burst to help it recover. I found that by the time I carefully stretched and topped the dough, the oven was ready for the next pizza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across Neapolitan, Thin &amp; Crispy and Pan Pizza modes, the Volt 2 produced truly stellar results for each style. I’ll note that I used dough recipes for each style from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_164567729X&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=609aeb40-f30f-4776-aa8e-4c374586f813&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=The+Ooni+Pizza+Project+by+Scott+Deley&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAVxQ4nGoga_HaiHXBwjwr8zglXZRqoYajUj4HCXdxKM4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOoni-Pizza-Project-Unofficial-Next-Level%2Fdp%2F164567729X" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ooni-Pizza-Project-Unofficial-Next-Level/dp/164567729X"><em>The Ooni Pizza Project </em>by Scott Deley</a>. I’ve found that his guidance leads to amazing pizzas, even if you’re planning to just use your home oven. Using the Volt 2, Neapolitan pies had ample leoparding and cooked quickly in the high heat. Thinner, New York-style pizza was indeed crispy on the bottom and perfectly browned on top while still having a pleasant chewiness. And my Detroit-style pan tests were crispy on the edges and pillowy soft inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two important things to note about using the Volt 2. First, the exterior gets hot, especially at 800 degrees and above. For that reason, you’ll want to avoid sitting anything on top of the oven while you’re using it (or very close to it, really). You’ll also need to allow ample time for the outside to cool before storing the Volt 2. The oven runs its own shutdown cycle, but the exterior may still be too warm to put away when that’s complete.</p>
<p>Second, despite a steam and smoke filter, the Volt 2 still expels steam out of the back. I combated this by putting the oven on my flat-top stove under the exhaust fan, but you’ll need to plan accordingly if you don’t want that wafting around your kitchen. I could see this being a problem for small living spaces like apartments.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="319e5868-5550-4c6d-8984-01d2731b01e6">The competition</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for Volt alternatives, there are two main competitors. The long-standing incumbent is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/breville-pizzaiolo-review-150020198.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Breville’s Pizzaiolo</a>. It too offers easy-to-use presets and features in addition to a degree of manual operation. My main issue with it was the price, which was initially $1,000 but is now $800. That reduced price is still $100 more than the Volt 2. I also had trouble with the confined round baking area and how difficult the oven is to clean since debris could fall down around the bottom heating element.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/current-backyard-debuts-the-model-p-smart-pizza-oven-at-ces-2025-010054271.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Current Model P</a>. This one wins the price war at under $500 and it too has presets and a max temperature of 850 degrees. Current’s app has a Pizza Build Calculator that assists with time, temperature and ingredients. I haven’t tested this one yet, but it’s on my list for the near future.&nbsp;</p>

It’s easier to use for all skill levels thanks to its clearer controls and large display. Presets work well, but they can also serve as a starting point for further recipe refinement for experienced users. And the pizza — my goodness, the pizza is consistently restaurant quality (or better) across a range of styles. Combine that performance with a better looking design, slightly smaller footprint and lower starting price and you’ve got a compelling case for a standalone indoor pizza oven. </p>

The total thrust of the upper stage of the rocket, meanwhile, is going from 320,000 lbf to 400,000 lbf. Paired with a new reusable fairing (the cover that goes over the payload of New Glenn) and an &quot;updated lower-cost tank design,&quot; Blue Origin claims that the upgraded rocket will benefit customers heading to &quot;low-Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because you asked… <a href="https://t.co/HRbQjRpHWC">pic.twitter.com/HRbQjRpHWC</a></p>— Dave Limp (@davill) <a href="https://twitter.com/davill/status/1991544049095045367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The company also has another rocket on the roadmap, New Glenn 9x4, the bigger sibling of the current New Glenn 7x2. Named for the number of engines it has at each stage (nine on the booster stage, four on the upper stage), New Glenn 9x4 can carry &quot;over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, over 14 metric tons direct to geosynchronous orbit and over 20 metric tons to trans-lunar injection,&quot; Blue Origin says. Per an image shared by Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/davill/status/1991544049095045367?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">on X</a>, the rocket is also bigger than the Saturn V rocket that ferried humans to the Moon during NASA&#39;s Apollo 11 mission.</p><p>That catapults Blue Origin into the same size range as SpaceX&#39;s Starship, which successfully <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">deployed its payload</a> for the first time in August, and is now facing retirement as SpaceX <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-is-preparing-the-next-gen-starship-after-a-successful-flight-test-130027382.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">develops its next-generation model</a>. </p><p>Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are competing to work with NASA on future Moon missions. If Blue Origin&#39;s lunar hunger wasn&#39;t clear from the prominent framing of the Moon in its New Glenn press images, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-planning-next-new-glenn-flight-for-early-next-year/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">reportedly plans</a> to land its unmanned lunar lander on the Moon in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origin-announces-new-glenn-rocket-upgrades-fit-for-a-trip-to-the-moon-192500333.html?src=rss]]></description>

If you simply can&#39;t wait until Valentine&#39;s Day to have an eerie experience with a fellow horror-loving person, you can check out a demo that dropped today. The announcement was part of the Xbox Partner Preview showcase, but you can also try the demo on PC and PlayStation 5. </p><p>We got a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/reanimal-promises-a-more-terrifying-journey-than-little-nightmares-200457474.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">first glimpse</a> at the next creepy creation from Tarsier Games, which made the first two installments of the Little Nightmares games, last year during Gamescom Opening Night. With Reanimal, players will need to work together to navigate dangerous terrain and escape a very unpleasant-looking island. This team has a great sense for how to create dread from the clever use of scale and proportion, as the two tiny children try to survive whatever spooky situation they&#39;ve been pushed into.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/reanimal-will-arrive-just-in-time-for-a-spooky-valentines-day-191523944.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and let you play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to the wall. Anker power banks are among the best. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than most brands out there.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-deals-anker-wireless-chargers">Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers</h2> 
<p>A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="http://solution.of/"><ins>solution</ins></a>. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once.

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-deals-anker-power-adapters">Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters</h2> 
<p>While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html"><ins>guide to the best fast chargers</ins></a> and we recommend the brand in a number of our <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html"><ins>accessories</ins></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-macbook-accessories-150014737.html"><ins>guides</ins></a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google just unveiled its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/"><ins>Nano Banana Pro image generation platform</ins></a>, which is also going by the name Gemini 3 Pro Image. The company promises this is an improvement over <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nano-banana-ai-mysterious-ai-202600466.html"><ins>previous versions of the software</ins></a> in nearly every way. Google says it will &quot;turn your visions into studio-quality designs with unprecedented control, flawless text rendering and enhanced world knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>The text rendering portion seems to have gotten a big upgrade here, as Nano Banana Pro can create context-rich infographics and diagrams. The software can render legible text on top of a pre-existing image, making it a good option for generating posters and stuff like that. Google says that this feature is available in multiple languages.</p>

<p>Google also says it can blend multiple elements into a single composition, with the ability to use up to 14 images at once. There are plenty of new editing controls. Users can select and edit any part of a created image. This can be used to adjust camera angles, change focus, adjust the color grade and even swap out the lighting from day to night.</p>
<p>Images created with Nano Banana Pro will have C2PA metadata embedded. This should, in time, make it easier to spot generative AI or deepfakes out there in the world. We&#39;ll have to see how that plays out. TikTok recently announced it would be using this metadata to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-will-let-users-tone-down-the-amount-of-ai-content-in-their-feed-050100596.html"><ins>better label AI-generated content</ins></a>, of which it <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ai-slop-has-turned-social-media-into-an-antisocial-wasteland/"><ins>currently does a very bad job at</ins></a>.</p>

<p>Nano Banana Pro is actually free to use. Free users are limited to a daily quota of images, with the number expanding for Google AI, Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers. Just open up the Gemini app and create an image, but be sure to use the &quot;Thinking&quot; model. It&#39;s also available in <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-editing-is-coming-to-search-notebooklm-and-photos-184111046.html"><ins>Search and NotebookLM</ins></a> for some subscribers.

Rather than running around the map to collect gems to level up and unlock or upgrade auto-firing weapons, <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>has a different format. It’s a dungeon-crawling roguelike deckbuilder.</p><p>It’s set in the same world as <em>Vampire Survivors </em>and each of the playable characters is in the original game. You’ll put together decks of attacks and other abilities to help you on your journeys through dungeons. There’s a card customization feature too. </p><p>Development of <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>started soon after <em>Vampire Survivors </em>hit early access and blew up in 2021. Poncle founder and CEO Luca Galante told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Xbox Wire</em></a><em> </em>that this is hopefully the first in a series of spinoffs in which “the idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of <em>VS </em>and to apply them to existing genres.” Galante hinted that a<em> Vampire Survivors </em>sequel is in the works too.</p><p><em>Vampire Crawlers </em>is expected to arrive in 2026. It’ll be available on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS. The game will debut on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/a-vampire-survivors-roguelike-deckbuilder-spinoff-is-coming-in-2026-183841289.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember way back in 2024, when Qualcomm said most x86 Windows games would <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-says-most-windows-games-will-work-on-its-latest-arm-laptop-chipset-152540577.html">run smoothly on its Arm chipsets</a>? Well, those promises were, shall we say, a bit premature. But with this week&#39;s launch of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/09/new-snapdragon-x2-elite-extreme-and-snapdragon-x2-elite-are-the-">Snapdragon Control Panel</a> (along with other updates), the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/11/windows-on-snapdragon-performance-boosts">says</a> things are finally looking up for Snapdragon X Elite laptop owners.</p>
<p>Alongside the launch of faster new chips, Qualcomm has made some quality-of-life improvements on the software end. Chief among them is this week&#39;s arrival of the Snapdragon Control Panel: the company&#39;s answer to NVIDIA and AMD&#39;s GPU tools. Like those apps, the Snapdragon software includes familiar features like automatic game detection, per-game settings and Adreno GPU driver updates. On that note, Qualcomm says its drivers have squashed bugs and boosted performance for over 100 games since last year.</p>

<p>The crucial x86 emulation layer has also gotten some love. <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-rebuilt-windows-11-around-ai-and-arm-chips-173152776.html">Microsoft&#39;s Prism Emulator</a> now supports Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) x86 emulation on Qualcomm chips. Meanwhile, the more advanced AVX2 will be supported out of the box on upcoming <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/qualcomm-says-its-new-snapdragon-chips-are-the-fastest-and-most-efficient-for-windows-pcs-084535090.html">Snapdragon X2 Elite laptops</a>. (Expect to hear more about those at CES.) Current <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-xps-13-copilot-review-a-capable-ai-pc-but-windows-on-arm-issues-remain-200050685.html">Snapdragon X Series devices</a> will receive the update &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>One Windows gaming obstacle Qualcomm acknowledged last year was kernel-level anti-cheat tech. At the time, multiplayer games that relied on it simply wouldn&#39;t work on its devices. But as part of its gaming announcements this week, Qualcomm highlighted <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s availability. That&#39;s thanks to Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat support. Qualcomm says it&#39;s also &quot;working with&quot; leading anti-cheat providers to add wider multiplayer support. That includes anti-cheat tech from Tencent, Roblox and more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/qualcomm-promises-better-gaming-performance-with-latest-windows-on-snapdragon-update-183529616.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Count this as the latest unexpected detente between Apple and Google. Today, Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/quick-share-airdrop/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> that the Pixel 10 series of phones can use Android Quick Share  with the iPhone’s AirDrop feature, meaning it’ll be much easier to shoot files and photos between the two platforms. While this feature is currently limited to Pixel 10 series phones, Google says it is looking to expand the feature to other devices.</p><p>Google dropped details on how it made this work from a privacy and security standpoint <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in its technical blog</a> if you want to get into the nitty-gritty. But it certainly sounds as if Google did this on its own without any input from Apple. “We accomplished this through our own implementation,” Alex Moriconi from Google told Engadget. “Our implementation was thoroughly vetted by our own privacy and security teams, and we also engaged a third party security firm to pentest the solution.”</p><p>But functionally, it sounds like this will work the same as Quick Share currently does. The receiving Apple device (this will work with iPads and Macs as well as iPhones) needs to set their Airdrop visibility preferences to “anyone for 10 minutes.” This means that people outside of your contact list will be able to initiate an AirDrop or Quick Share transfer. From there, the Pixel 10 user should be able to see the receiving Apple device when they go to share things via Quick Share as normal.</p><p>Google also notes that Android devices can receive files from Apple devices that are using AirDrop. They’ll just need to make sure their Quick Share visibility settings are similarly set to “everyone for 10 minutes” or that they’re in “receive” mode on the Quick Share page.</p><p>It’s not clear if Apple was involved in making this new feature work or if Google did this all on its own. Apple hasn’t released a corresponding post on its own newsroom. If Apple wasn’t involved, the obvious question is whethere or not they’ll treat this as a security breach and release a software update that undos Google’s work. And if they do, it’s entirely possible that we’re going to head down another long road of the company’s bickering about security versus openness. </p><p>We’ve reached out to Apple to get more details and will update this post if we learn anything. </p><p><strong>Update, November 20, 2025, 1:27PM ET:</strong> Added a statement from Google.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-quick-share-now-works-with-apples-airdrop-feature-on-pixel-10-phones-173646458.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would effectively block states from enacting their own AI regulations. According to a draft document obtained by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/white-house-prepares-executive-order-to-block-state-ai-laws-00660719"><em><ins>Politico</ins></em></a>, the effort would entail a multifaceted approach including an &quot;AI Litigation Task Force&quot; run by the DOJ.</p>
<p>This indicates the president has not wavered in his desire to eschew federalism in favor of a more centralized power structure around artificial intelligence. This past summer, the administration released its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf"><ins>AI Action Plan</ins></a>, which, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everyones-a-loser-in-trumps-ai-action-plan-160023247.html"><ins>among other things</ins></a>, recommends that the &quot;Federal government should not allow AI-related Federal funding to be directed toward states with burdensome AI regulations.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While it also adds that the government should &quot;not interfere with states’ rights to pass prudent laws that are not unduly restrictive to innovation,&quot; this runs counter to some actions coming from the White House. Senator Ted Cruz, at the behest of the president, tried to add a 10-year moratorium on states’ AI regulation to the President&#39;s One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed this summer. This amendment was ultimately voted down by the Senate 99-1.</p>
<p>The issue is heating up again as the president <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115572931492563128"><ins>took to Truth Social</ins></a> to say that &quot;overregulation by the States&quot; would undermine the US economy and lead to &quot;Woke AI.&quot; Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1991487762722353228"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that no such moratorium should be put in place, and said states rights and federalism must be preserved.</p>
<p><em>Politico</em> reports that the administration is likely to try and insert a regulation moratorium again in the year-end annual defense bill. The administration seems convinced that a patchwork of varying regulations around the country would prove too onerous in the race for global AI dominance, and seeks to use every lever of federal power to prevent one.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-administration-may-use-federal-agencies-to-fight-state-level-ai-regulation-182514317.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rise of cloud-based streaming for games has made  it possible to play plenty of high-profile games on Chromebooks — not natively, but when you’re using a primarily web-based platform you’ll take what you can get. As of today, Google’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebooksgeforce-now-fast-pass/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">making it easier</a> for new Chromebook buyers to play games right out of the box. Anyone who buys a Chromebook will get 12 months of access to GeForce Now, NVIDIA’s cloud-streaming service that lets you access games you own on platforms like Steam, Xbox and so forth.</p><p>It’s not just the standard GeForce Now access, either. Google says this new “Fast Pass” tier has no ads and lets Chromebook users skip the queues that free members have to wait in. Of course, there are some restrictions: this plan only provides 10 hours of gameplay a a month. Since GeForce Now already has a free tier, I presume that after the 10 hours is up you’ll just get dropped down to that experience, which removes priority queue access, has ads and limits you to one-hour sessions. You’re also capped at 1080p and 60 fps, but that should be fine for most Chromebooks.</p><p>This is the latest attempt by Google to inject some gaming life into the Chromebook platform. A few years ago, some of Google’s hardware partners released Chromebook models <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-cloud-gaming-chromebooks-asus-lenovo-acer-130030080.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">built with cloud-based gaming in mind</a>, and Google also was working on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-for-chromebooks-alpha-preview-174030567.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">bringing Steam to Chrome OS.</a>  Even though Steam worked pretty well, Google has reportedly decided to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-for-chromebooks-is-reportedly-being-discontinued-194020340.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">nix the project</a> going forward. And I haven’t heard much about the Chromebooks for gaming initiative recently either —&nbsp;but that matters less if any Chromebook with decent specs can take advantage of services like GeForce Now. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/new-chromebooks-now-come-with-a-year-of-priority-geforce-now-access-181708311.html?src=rss]]></description>

But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching <em>The Expanse</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Dave the Diver</em>, the smash hit adventure RPG/management hybrid, is finally available on Xbox. The game, about an intrepid scuba diver named Dave who splits his time between underwater adventuring and serving sushi in a local restaurant, started as a PC exclusive in 2023, but has since made its way to Switch, Switch 2, PS4 and PS5. Only Xbox remained, but it’s here now, along with all DLC released to date.</p>
<p>Since launch, developer Mintrocket has added to the lengthy base game campaign with a number of expansions, including a tie-in with fellow fishing game <em>Dredge</em>, and a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dave-the-diver-is-bringing-godzilla-with-him-to-ps5-this-spring-233136441.html">Godzilla</a> crossover. Ichiban Kasuga from the Like a Dragon series has also made an appearance in the Blue Hole, because why not? The upcoming &#39;Into the Jungle&#39; DLC was <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dave-the-divers-in-the-jungle-dlc-may-not-arrive-until-2026-but-godzilla-is-back-203019821.html">delayed</a> to early 2026 back in the summer, but Mintrocket has given us a sneak peek at what it promises is <em>Dave the Diver</em>’s biggest expansion yet in a new trailer for the Xbox launch. The very meta trailer also shows Dave playing his own game on a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> while at sea. (Technically he could already have done that via Steam but it&#39;s still a nice touch.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you haven’t played <em>Dave the Diver </em>before, it’s almost impossible to do the game justice with a brief summary. The core loop sees you diving for fish during the day, which you obediently bring to the chef at the sushi joint you moonlight at for preparation. But that’s barely scratching the surface. The eponymous diver also battles sea monsters, runs errands for a secret underwater civilization and eventually manages his own farm. Not content with simply being an RPG and a management sim, <em>Dave the Diver </em>is crammed with mini-games and genre diversions that consistently surprise you. It’s frequently bonkers, but it works.</p>
<p>Now it’s on Xbox — which includes Xbox One as well as Xbox Series X|S — you can play one of our best games of 2023 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2023-150053925.html">award-winners</a> on virtually everything, so you no longer have any excuses. The PS5 and Switch 2 are also getting a physical release in 2026, which will include the latest DLC.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/dave-the-diver-is-now-available-on-xbox-180651483.html?src=rss]]></description>

This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there&#39;s even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you&#39;re saving) and one of the best offers I&#39;ve ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We&#39;ll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live.</p>

It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.)</p> 
<p>If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate.

Those people can now more easily import their playlists into the Spotify app, thanks to its latest integration with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.tunemymusic.com/"><ins>TuneMyMusic</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Available through Spotify mobile users and rolling out globally from today, you can access the new feature through Your Library in the Spotify app. Scroll to the bottom and you’ll see an option to import your music by connecting to TuneMyMusic (it looks like it boots you into your browser at this stage) and choosing the service you want to transfer from. Apple Music already lets you do something <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0efbe043-2e3e-4ed4-a3b3-79ac660062a3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=similar&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLWdiLzExODI0OSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGVmYmUwNDMtMmUzZS00ZWQ0LWEzYjMtNzlhYzY2MDA2MmEzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLWdiLzExODI0OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd6Z19LKsqDfxrtHiaNBqVK1lo6tltFTXaieUJA_9kji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-gb%2F118249" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118249"><ins>similar</ins></a> directly from within your settings on an iPhone, iPad or Android device, or through the web.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TuneMyMusic supports transfers into Spotify from a wide range of streaming platforms, including Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music and Tidal. You won’t lose your playlists in the source location. It’ll just copy them over so they appear in your Spotify library.</p>
<p>If you aren’t already aware, Spotify lets you customize playlists in a number of ways, from inviting friends to add their own songs, to designing the cover art yourself. So if you’ve been considering a jump from elsewhere, this new feature should make the transition a little easier.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/spotify-now-includes-a-built-in-tool-for-importing-your-playlists-from-other-services-175100343.html?src=rss]]></description>

And those inner children are squealing at some of the Lego Black Friday toy deals we&#39;re already seeing, like Disney and Harry Potter advent calendars, detailed Star Wars models and Lego&#39;s own brands like Creator, Friends and Botanicals.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Uber Eats has announced it&#39;ll soon start using Starship robots to complete food deliveries in certain parts of the UK, beginning in the Leeds and Sheffield areas. These little robo-couriers will only be able to handle deliveries from &quot;select merchants&quot; for the time being.</p>
<p>The robots won&#39;t accept tips, for obvious reasons, but customers can still rate their experience via the app. We aren&#39;t sure what happens to a particular robot with enough bad ratings. Maybe it gets sent to a farm in the countryside somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The service launches in December and the platform says it&#39;ll share more information at that date. Uber Eats also says it plans on expanding the operating territory in the near future. To that end, Starship robots are coming to &quot;additional European markets in 2026&quot; and more US markets in 2027.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t Uber&#39;s first foray into robot deliveries. Uber Eats has used robots from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-food-delivery-robots-footage-led-to-a-criminal-conviction-in-la-190854339.html"><ins>Serve Robotics</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-teams-with-avride-to-offer-self-driving-vehicles-for-rides-and-food-deliveries-201622292.html"><ins>Avride in the past</ins></a> to deliver food.</p>

<p>As for Starship, these <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-starship-robots-50000-deliveries.html"><ins>diminutive delivery robots</ins></a> have actually<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-31-starship-launches-robot-package-delivery-service.html"><ins> been around since 2018</ins></a>. The company says there are currently around 3,000 robots in operation across the world in more than 270 different locations.

In fact, it’s going all the way back, because it’s reviving the very first WhatsApp feature. You can think of About (the creators were really not very good at naming things, huh?) as a status update or WhatsApp’s version of an AIM away message. It’s designed to let your contacts know at a glance what you’ve got going on, such as something that’s keeping you busy and might make you slow to respond to messages.</p><p>The About message appears on both your profile and at the top of one-on-one chats. By default, the About message will vanish after 24 hours, but you can set it to vanish earlier or stick around for longer. You can do this by going to the “set about” option in the WhatsApp settings. You also have control over who is able to see your About message — you can restrict it to your contacts or allow anyone to view it from your profile.</p><p>This is a handy little update that apes the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-makes-its-status-update-feature-more-interactive-160057778.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">notes feature in sibling apps Instagram</a> and Facebook. WhatsApp is starting to roll About (back) out to all users on mobile devices this week.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/whatsapp_about.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/whatsapp_about.jpg" style="height:900px;width:1600px;" alt="Illustration of the About feature in WhatsApp" data-uuid="0c7412c9-26d0-47b2-8042-7aafdcb78ea6"><figcaption>Illustration of the About feature in WhatsApp</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/whatsapp-is-bringing-back-its-very-first-feature-170100513.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is gradually <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-the-official-replacement-for-google-assistant-on-smart-devices-130041482.html"><ins>replacing</ins></a> the outgoing Assistant with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html"><ins>Gemini</ins></a> in all of its apps, and now it’s the turn of Android Auto. In the next few months, any Android users who have made the jump to Gemini on their phones will be able to interact with the next-generation AI assistant while driving using natural language.</p>
<p>The Gemini-ification of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-maps-gemini-integration-will-make-hands-free-navigation-more-conversational-140009629.html"><ins>Google Maps</ins></a> has already happened, and its new features are also coming to Android Auto. You can do things like ask the AI about restaurants that serve a specific cuisine on your current route, and ask follow-up questions about the menu or its proximity to your destination. From there, Maps can guide you to the restaurant. Gemini lets you ask questions as you would when talking to another human, which theoretically means you can focus more on the road and less on how to construct a prompt that it will understand.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The same applies to sending messages while driving. Where before, you’d have to say exactly what you wanted to write. You can just give the AI the gist and it will use the relevant information, such as your ETA if you’re meeting someone, and it can add extra details if requested without you needing to restart the message from scratch. Gemini will also summarize grouped messages.</p>
<p>Gemini can also access your Gmail account and pick out things like hotel addresses, as well as running you through your unread emails. Other apps you might want to use while driving, such as Calendar, can also be accessed by the more conversational Gemini.</p>
<p>Gemini doubles as a DJ of sorts too, and is able to create on-the-fly playlists with specific conditions relating to genre, length or your general mood. You can even ask it to choose songs that fit the current weather outside. It can also act as a tour guide, running you through some facts about a destination, and if you’re on the way to the wedding, Google even suggests practicing your speech in the car. Gemini likely won’t judge you for calling on its services for some last-minute speech-writing either.</p>
<p>As long as you have the Gemini app on your phone, it should start appearing on your Android Auto-enabled infotainment system. You can either say “Hey Google”, tap the on-screen mic button or press the voice control button on the steering wheel. 45 languages are supported and you can translate any message into a language that Gemini knows in real-time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-arrives-on-android-auto-170012688.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Google TV Streamer is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device</a>. It has a faster processor than Google&#39;s previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV.</p> 
<p>The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you&#39;ll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don&#39;t already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>French authorities are investigating allegations that Grok made statements denying the Holocaust. The Paris public prosecutor&#39;s office <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/holocaust-denial-by-musks-ai-chatbot-to-feed-french-criminal-probe-of-x/">said</a> it was adding Elon Musk’s chatbot’s latest controversy to a criminal probe initially launched in July.</p>
<p>In a since-deleted post that was screenshotted by the Auschwitz Memorial account on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/AuschwitzMuseum/status/1991149135576158538">X</a> before it was taken down, Grok advanced arguments popular with Holocaust deniers regarding the use of gas chambers to murder millions of Jews during the second world war. It said (translated from its French origin) that &quot;the plans of the crematoria at Auschwitz do indeed show facilities designed for Zyklon B disinfection against typhus, with ventilation systems adapted for this purpose rather than mass executions.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The chatbot went on to comment that remaining cyanide residues are &quot;consistent with decontamination but not with repeated homicidal gassings,&quot; citing “controversial independent analyses.&quot; Grok also described gas chambers as most people understand them today as a &quot;narrative&quot; backed by &quot;laws suppressing questioning&quot; and a &quot;cultural taboo that discourages critical examination of the evidence.&quot;</p>
<p>As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/20/french-authorities-look-into-holocaust-denial-posts-elon-musk-grok-ai"><em>The Guardian</em></a> (to whom X has not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing), three French ministers and several human rights and anti-discrimination groups filed formal complaints about the post, which remained online for three days before it was eventually deleted. Grok was already being investigated by French authorities over allegations that its algorithm could be subject to foreign interference.</p>
<p>It comes as Grokipedia, Elon Musk’s Wikipedia alternative that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-grokipedia-is-online-after-it-briefly-crashed-out-231108836.html">launched</a> last month, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-grokipedia-wikipedia-neo-nazi-grok-42-encyclopedia-rcna244749">includes</a> 42 citations for the neo-Nazi website Stormfront, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09685">researchers</a> at Cornell University. While conceding that this number is &quot;trivial&quot; as a percentage of Grokipedia’s overall share of sources, the study also found that the website cites &quot;many more sources&quot; that have been blacklisted by English Wikipedia editors or dismissed as low quality by &quot;external scholars,&quot; compared to Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Grok, the post currently being investigated in France isn’t the first time that the chatbot has got itself into trouble. In July, a number of X posts were taken down after Grok <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/grok-sure-seems-antisemitic-after-its-recent-update-000642015.html">emerged</a> from an update parroting antisemetic tropes and praising Hitler. The team responsible for the chatbot later <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-team-apologizes-for-the-chatbots-horrific-behavior-and-blames-mechahitler-on-a-bad-update-184520189.html">apologized</a> for its &quot;horrific behavior.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/authorities-probe-holocaust-denial-responses-from-xs-grok-155835701.html?src=rss]]></description>

This is 20 percent off and represents a record low price. It&#39;s a heck of a deal, given that the original asking price is nearly $200. There&#39;s just one caveat. The price is only for Amazon Prime members.</p>

<p>The DJI Neo was recently pushed off our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-drone-120046775.html"><ins>best drones</ins></a> in favor of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-2-review-the-best-budget-drone-is-now-even-better-120026045.html"><ins>newer Neo 2</ins></a>, but the original is still a fantastic, budget-friendly option. We called it the &quot;best $200 drone ever made&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-review-the-best-200-drone-ever-made-010032884.html"><ins>in our official review</ins></a>, and with good reason. It&#39;s quick, ultra-maneuverable and beginner-friendly. The learning curve here isn&#39;t that steep.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>It boasts four propeller guards, for safety, and the built-in 4K camera certainly gets the job done. It&#39;s extremely light, weighing just 135 grams. This makes it easy to transport, sure, but also means that the Neo is exempt from drone license requirements.</p>

</div> 
<p>This version doesn&#39;t ship with a dedicated controller, though there is a combo pack for that, but that doesn&#39;t really matter here. The Neo can be maneuvered by hand gestures, human voice, mobile app or standard RC controller.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-dji-neo-drone-is-back-on-sale-for-159-for-black-friday-155647403.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been waiting to grab a PlayStation 5, this <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> deal is worth noting.

<p>Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming.</p> 
<p>Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive.</p> 
<p>If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The fifth and final season of <em>Stranger Things</em> is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/stranger-things-5-finally-has-its-release-date-152255914.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">almost upon us</a> (well, the first part of it, anyway), which means there are Brand Integrations™ afoot. One of those involves <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/unity-games-are-coming-to-fortnite-133000076.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em> </em>and a new map for the fast-paced Blitz mode. Starting on November 21, it seems that you’ll be able to go into the Upside Down for quickfire matches at a creepy version of the Creel House. </p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9Tycw5VpRFs" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">The trailer</a> indicates that there will be skins of several of the main characters available, so you should be able to play as Lucas, Dustin, Mike, Will and Vecna. Other <em>Stranger Things </em>cosmetics will be on deck as well, as leaker FireMonkey <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/FireMonkey/status/1991525821593288756" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">revealed</a> a backpack styled after the grandfather clock Vecna uses to terrify some of Hawkins’ residents as well as some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/FireMonkey/status/1991508053456482725" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">emotes</a>. I’m hoping that “Running Up That Hill” by Kate Bush is coming to <em>Fortnite Festival</em> too. </p><div><div style="max-width:56vh;"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:177.7778%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Tycw5VpRFs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div></div><p>This isn’t the first crossover between <em>Stranger Things </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>. Skins of Jim Hopper, the Demogorgon and Eleven hit the game <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-04-fortnite-stranger-things-skins.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">all the way back in 2019</a> alongside season three of the show. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-03-fortnite-stranger-things-crossover-mega-mall.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Portals</a> styled after those in the series popped up in <em>Fortnite </em>too, but it’s neat that there’s a full-on <em>Stranger Things </em>map in one of the core game modes this time.</p><p>Collaborations have been an increasingly integral aspect of <em>Fortnite </em>for a years and the current season is hardly an exception. Epic Games turned the island into a cel-shaded version of Springfield for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-now-includes-a-fortnite-crew-subscription-151826277.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Simpsons-themed chaos</a>. </p><p>The next season, which is set to start on November 30, ties into the theatrical release of <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, </em>which fuses the two parts of <em>Kill Bill </em>together. The season is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fortnites-tarantino-season-will-include-a-previously-unfilmed-kill-bill-short/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">slated</a> to feature a version of a <em>Kill Bill </em>scene that Quentin Tarantino never actually shot for the films. </p><p>That’s not all on the <em>Fortnite </em>crossover front, of course. Formula 1 cosmetics are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nizWptDQ_Ao" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">hitting the Item Shop today</a>.

An entirely new USA-themed island seems to be in store too, as the new season is the first one of <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 7. Chapters are major annual refreshes for <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-stranger-things-map-is-coming-to-fortnites-blitz-mode-on-november-21-154458086.html?src=rss]]></description>

Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tools/compare/tcl-qm7k-vs-hisense-u75qg/88608/96104">some reviews</a> say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content <em>too</em> bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it&#39;s not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set.

That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming.

For Black Friday, you can save on Sling TV&#39;s newly announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-tv-launches-a-5-day-pass-for-commitment-free-cable-150021645.html">$5 Day Passes</a>.

<p>Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you&#39;re trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children&#39;s channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget&#39;s pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html">the best customizable live streaming service</a> for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn&#39;t getting you all the channels you need, you don&#39;t need to pay that much more to get them.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

To watch those, you&#39;ll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn&#39;t available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month.</p> 
<p>Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you&#39;re getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV&#39;s DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV&#39;s interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you&#39;re likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/black-friday-streaming-deal-sling-orange-day-passes-are-only-1-right-now-231208837.html?src=rss]]></description>

The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert.</p> 
<p>The Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">buying guide</a> for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better.</p>

The company is reducing its headcount and cutting back on outsourcing and other external labor expenses in service of &quot;building a stronger Verizon,&quot; Schulman wrote in <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2225d53b-bfe1-4d56-bd6e-3885c642b140&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8c0fed59-a406-450c-be6f-29658e6e04fb&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Verizon&amp;linkText=a+memo+to+staff&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXJpem9uLmNvbS9hYm91dC9uZXdzL2J1aWxkaW5nLXN0cm9uZ2VyLXZlcml6b24iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhjMGZlZDU5LWE0MDYtNDUwYy1iZTZmLTI5NjU4ZTZlMDRmYiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmVyaXpvbi5jb20vYWJvdXQvbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1zdHJvbmdlci12ZXJpem9uIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbHoNrVt-6V_q-AUFTsIP9nXQGRO8OkoIGJrlSKnWfzH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fbuilding-stronger-verizon" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Verizon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/building-stronger-verizon">a memo to staff</a>. The company will also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/verizon-cutting-more-than-13000-jobs-it-restructures-2025-11-20/" data-i13n="slk:convert;cpos:2;pos:1">convert</a> 179 retail stores that it owns into franchised outlets and it will close one store.</p><p>In September, Verizon said it had around 100,000 full-time employees, so the layoffs constitute about 13 percent of the workforce. Over the previous three years, Verizon had cut about 20,000 jobs. Meanwhile, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/fcc-approves-verizons-20-billion-merger-with-frontier-181434890.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">$20 billion takeover</a> of telecoms company Frontier Communications is set to close early next year.</p><p>It was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/verizon-may-cut-15000-jobs-next-week-214143406.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">reported last week</a> that Verizon was set to cull around 15,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive in the face of sterner competition and a drop in postpaid wireless customers. Schulman — a former PayPal CEO who took on his current job in October — indicated during an earnings call last month that the company would “take bold and fiscally responsible action to redefine Verizon&#39;s trajectory at this critical inflection point for our company. These will not be incremental changes.&quot;</p><p>In Thursday’s memo, Schulman framed the downsizing as an attempt to create a leaner, more customer-focused operation. “As a customer-first culture, we have to align our teams and resources to create new value for customers and build a faster, stronger and more proactive Verizon,” Schulman wrote. “To do that, we must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.”</p><p>Verizon says it has set up a $20 million reskilling and career transition fund to support the workers it’s turfing out. “This fund will focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps,” Schulman claimed. “Verizon is the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/verizon-confirms-plans-to-lay-off-13000-employees-144608021.html?src=rss]]></description>
