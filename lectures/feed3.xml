<h2 id="jump-link-latest-robot-vacuum-news">Latest robot vacuum news</h2> 
<p>CES is typically a time for robovac manufacturers to unveil new innovations and this year was no different. Companies like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ankers-ces-smart-home-lineup-includes-a-1600-eufy-robovac-160000133.html">Eufy</a> announced new models, many of which are on the higher end of the price spectrum. Those flagship announcements are often paired with more minor ones that usher in mildly upgraded versions of midrange and entry-level machines.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Now that robot vacuums are ubiquitous, the new models that make headlines tend to have some sort of gimmick like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html">a built-in arm for picking up clothes</a>, or offer (supposedly) top-tier suction power and a slew of extras. They also tend to be super expensive. However, most people will be served just fine with a robot vacuum that doesn’t choke at the first sign of dust bunnies or pet hair, and maybe has mopping capabilities if you want a machine that can tackle hard floors in addition to carpet. Those other innovations are nice-to-haves, not necessities.</p> 
<p>Arguably even bigger than CES announcements is the fact that iRobot, a name synonymous with smart cleaning robots, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> at the end of 2025. What does that mean for Roomba owners? Not too much immediately, as the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html">stated</a> that it will continue to operate with “no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships or ongoing product support.&quot; However, this also means that buying a new Roomba in 2026 is a questionable decision.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-robot-vacuums">What to look for in the best robot vacuums</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tldr">TLDR</h3> 
<p>Despite companies coming out with gimmicky extras and new software perks in their robot vacuum lineups, the core competency of these devices have remained the same for years: sucking up dirt without needing your attention. You want a robot vacuum with the strongest suction power you can afford. Those with tile and hardwood floors can consider robovacs with mopping capabilities, and those who want peak convenience should opt for a model with a self-emptying base. However, both of those extra features will cost extra.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-floor-type"><strong>Floor type</strong></h3> 
<p>First and foremost, we recommend considering the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into high piles more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power, but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vacuum-suction"><strong>Vacuum suction</strong></h3> 
<p>Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robovacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the machine can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wi-fi-connectivity"><strong>Wi-Fi connectivity</strong></h3> 
<p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, so it’s best to double check before you buy something on the low end of affordable. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mapping-features-and-object-detection"><strong>Mapping features and object detection</strong></h3> 
<p>Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features and improved object detection. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam.</p> 
<p>Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mopping-capabilities">Mopping capabilities</h3> 
<p>Mopping features are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines that support this will have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part.</p> 
<p>Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-self-empty-station-inclusion">Self-empty station inclusion</h3> 
<p>Finally, for peak convenience, consider a robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks.</p> 
<p>Just keep in mind that many self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in (look for mentions of “bagless” to avoid this all together). Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> 
<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to the insides.</p> 
<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards.</p> 
<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums">How we test robot vacuums</h2> 
<p>We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies, stairs (gasp) and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine.</p> 
<p>If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum&#39;s mobile app for usability and convenience. As we&#39;re testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-faqs">Robot vacuum FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h3> 
<p>We tackled this question when we reviewed <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuums</a> and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.</p> 
<p>That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-robot-vacuums-last">How long do robot vacuums last?</h3> 
<p>Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you&#39;re emptying the machine&#39;s bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum&#39;s filter needs changing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-robot-vacuums-work-better-than-handheld-vacuums">Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums?</h3> 
<p>There&#39;s no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-often-do-you-have-to-clean-a-robot-vacuum">How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum?</h3> 
<p>Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-negatives-of-robot-vacuums">What are the negatives of robot vacuums?</h3> 
<p>Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html">cordless stick vacuum</a>, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.</p>

The AI business is beginning a global rollout of an age prediction tool to determine whether or not a user is a minor. “The model looks at a combination of behavioral and account-level signals, including how long an account has existed, typical times of day when someone is active, usage patterns over time,and a user’s stated age,” the company’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-age-prediction/" data-i13n="slk:announcement;cpos:1;pos:1">announcement</a> states. If an individual is incorrectly characterized by ChatGPT as underage, they will need to submit a selfie to correct the mistake through the Persona age verification platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Most AI companies have been willing to push new features first and then attempt to layer on a patchwork of protections and safety guards on top of them after they cause harm.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Akai just revealed its most powerful standalone groovebox, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.akaipro.com/mpc-xl/"><ins>the MPC XL</ins></a>. For the uninitiated, the MPC has been around since the 1980s and pretty much defined hip hop from that era. The line has continuously iterated to keep up with the times and the XL looks to be the baddest of them all.</p>
<p>First of all, it offers four times the processing power of previous MPCs, which is enough to load up to 32 virtual instruments at the same time. This is assisted by a full 16GB of RAM, which is a whole lot in this <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html"><ins>era of AI tomfoolery</ins></a>. The XL can handle 16 audio tracks simultaneously. In my experience with previous units, this is more than enough for a full song.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5f5eeb632552476982df8371f4250ac9"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfEObnwQgjA?si=m6q4rbbyXk_nKUvl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It runs on a proprietary OS and features a 10-inch OLED touchscreen for making adjustments. There are also dozens of knobs and buttons to play with, including 16 knobs that integrate with the display for real-time feedback.</p>
<p>The XL features a step sequencer, but this is an MPC. The real star attraction are those 16 drum pads. These pads can be set to trigger samples and hits, but can also be programmed to initiate effects and do all kinds of other stuff. Each pad has four quadrants, one for each corner, and they are all fully adjustable.</p>
<p>Looking for even more nuanced control? There are two assignable touch-strips and plenty of short-cut keys. It has built-in microphone preamps, phono inputs for sampling, instrument inputs and numerous other connectivity options. This is a true flagship in every sense of the word. It&#39;s also very, very large.</p>
<div id="62fdca28061b44f5a833f3665d06c160"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xnzRVFe3RsU?si=b5d-TJwzQkmW497t" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The MPC may have started as a hip hop machine, but newer models are useful for any genre of music. To that end, it comes with an extensive collection of plugins, samples and effects. These even include some plugins made by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/many-akai-devices-will-soon-support-native-instruments-sound-packs-140059822.html"><ins>rival company Native Instruments</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The software can handle stuff like stem separation, time-stretching and more. The workflow has been heavily inspired by modern DAWs, with a full arrangement view available on that OLED.</p>
<p>The MPC XL is a standalone unit, so it doesn&#39;t need a computer or anything like that. The power requirements here, however, don&#39;t allow for batteries.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, you just need to give your mind a little vacation. And these days, outer space sounds like as good a destination as any. Thankfully, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/webb-telescope-images-an-aging-binary-star-system-in-the-center-of-a-four-layered-cosmic-dust-shell-140000485.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">James Webb Space Telescope</a> (JWST) is here to give us a dazzling new image of the Helix Nebula.</p><p>Discovered in the early 19th century, the Helix Nebula resides in the constellation Aquarius. (Cue <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjxSCAalsBE" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">The 5th Dimension</a>.) At about 655 light-years away, it&#39;s one of Earth&#39;s closest planetary nebulae. When zoomed farther out, it&#39;s easy to see why it&#39;s been nicknamed the Eye of God or Eye of Sauron. This 2004 image from the Hubble telescope illustrates that.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/hubble.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/hubble.jpg" style="height:4800px;width:8000px;" alt="An eye-like nebula in space" data-uuid="0889efa4-4b08-4cfe-b390-1bd8a993a2a3"/><figcaption>A wider view of the same nebula from 2004</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA / ESA / C.R. O&#39;Dell (Vanderbilt University) / M. Meixner / P. McCullough / G. Bacon ( STSI)</div></figure><p>What we&#39;re seeing in the nebula is, in a sense, a moment of death that lays the groundwork for a new birth. The dying star (out of frame in the closer new image) sheds its outer layers. As expelled gas and dust cool, they provide raw material that could someday form new stars and perhaps planetary systems.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esawebb.org/news/weic2601/?lang" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">new image</a> from Webb&#39;s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) provides a much closer, higher-resolution view.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/webb_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/webb_2.jpg" style="height:8077px;width:13464px;" alt="Pillar-like reddish knots in the Helix Nebula" data-uuid="ca4e844f-4a20-4ab1-91de-e2b19606e76e"/><figcaption>Pillar-like reddish knots in the Helix Nebula</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Those pillars you see are called cometary knots, and this image is our best view of those to date. &quot;Here, blistering winds of hot gas from the dying star are crashing into colder shells of dust and gas that were shed earlier in its life, sculpting the nebula&#39;s remarkable structure,&quot; the ESA wrote in its press release.</p><p>The knots&#39; colors represent temperature and chemistry. Hints of blue indicate the hottest gas (energized by ultraviolet light). The yellow regions, where hydrogen atoms form molecules, are farther from the nebula&#39;s nucleus (and therefore cooler). On the edges, reddish-orange regions depict the coolest material, where gas thins and dust begins to form.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/earth-is-having-some-issues-so-lets-enjoy-the-webb-telescopes-new-nebula-image-181049901.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you're looking to up your privacy game on the internet in the new year, you can do so for a little less than usual thanks to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">ExpressVPN's</a> latest deal. Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That's 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-right-now-180602610.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roland just unveiled the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.roland.com/RolandComSite/media/global/release/pdf/2026/20260120_1_GOMIXER_STUDIO.pdf"><ins>Go:Mixer Studio</ins></a>, a powerful entry in the company&#39;s line of audio interfaces. This one promises to be a portable and affordable way to create high-quality recordings with a smartphone or PC.</p>
<p>The biggest news here are the 12 input channels and six output channels. This means that users can record multiple instruments at once and even run the signal through outboard gear if so desired. There are two XLR inputs on the back with phantom power, an instrument jack, stereo ¼-inch line-in jacks, an aux input, TRS MIDI ins and outs, two headphones jacks and stereo line outs for connecting monitor speakers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8cb41a3b58cb456cabc73a99da48a753"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMx_B1omZ08?si=gwLiJneuptpNu-on" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It records up to 24-bit/192kHz audio, which will certainly get the job done. The device comes with built-in effects for mangling audio on the fly. Each audio input also has a dedicated EQ and compressor directly on the channel.</p>
<p>It connects via an app that&#39;s available for iOS, Windows and MacOS. The iOS app actually lets users capture both video and multitrack audio at the same time, which should be a boon for streamers and content creators of all stripes. The Windows and MacOS apps allow for complete control of the mixer remotely.</p>
<p>As for the unit itself, there are several big knobs to adjust parameters and a color display. It&#39;s also really small and light, making it easy to pack away in case of an unexpected recording session. The device can even be mounted on a mic stand.</p>
<p>The Roland Go: Mixer Studio is available right now and costs $300.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a strange twist of fate, a fire broke out this week at the Rad Power Bikes retail store warehouse in Huntington Beach, California, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://electrek.co/2026/01/20/fire-reported-at-california-building-housing-rad-power-bikes-retail-store-warehouse/"><em>Electrek</em> reports</a>. The structural blaze came less than two months after the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Warnings/2026/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Immediately-Stop-Using-Batteries-for-E-Bikes-from-Rad-Power-Bikes-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-Risk-of-Serious-Injury-or-Death?utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=20251124">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC) warned customers to &quot;immediately stop&quot; using and dispose of some of the company&#39;s e-bike batteries due to fire hazard. In December, Rad filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, stating it couldn&#39;t afford to recall the batteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We’re working with local authorities to review a thermal incident that occurred at our Huntington Beach store Sunday evening,&quot; a Rad Power Bikes spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;The incident was contained and happened while the store was closed. The cause of the fire has not been confirmed.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The recent two-alarm fire hit a commercial complex with multiple businesses. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMPK_CMY-s4">Footage from the fire</a> shows e-bikes outside of the warehouse as firemen fought the blaze. Engadget has reached out to Rad for more information on the fire&#39;s impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPSC&#39;s November warning told of 31 reports of fire, with 12 of those involving property damage. In some cases, the battery was in storage, not being charged or used, yet still caught fire. The CPSC told customers to get rid of (in a safe, detailed manner) specific models of Rad&#39;s lithium-ion batteries. It claimed that the &quot;hazardous&quot; batteries were at risk of igniting or exploding, even more if wet or interacting with debris.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rad told the CPSC it couldn&#39;t recall the batteries as it couldn&#39;t afford to offer replacements and refunds. &quot;Rad offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns, including offering consumers an opportunity to upgrade to Safe Shield batteries (described below) at a substantial discount. CPSC rejected this opportunity,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://press.radpowerbikes.com/258269-rad-power-bikes-response-to-cpsc-safety-statement/">Rad Power Bikes said in a statement</a> at the time. &quot;The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.&quot;</p>
<p>The company also said it disagreed with the CPSC&#39;s &quot;characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.&quot; It also pointed to the incident rate being below one percent and stated that all lithium-ion batteries come with a risk when customers do things — such as improper charging and excessive exposure to moisture — that Rad cautions against.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta has a lot of work to do when it comes to limiting <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/metas-oversight-board-criticizes-companys-hastily-announced-hate-speech-policy-changes-120042137.html">hate speech on its platforms</a>. Now, its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/board-to-review-for-first-time-meta-approach-to-disabling-accounts/">Oversight Board</a> is looking into the company&#39;s decision to ban an account for, among other things, posting visual violent threats and harassment against a journalist — and it wants the public&#39;s advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the year prior to the ban, Meta referred five posts due to violations of its hateful conduct, bullying and harassment, violence and incitement and adult nudity and sexual activity community standards. In addition to the posts harassing the woman journalist, the user also shared &quot;anti-gay slurs against prominent politicians and content depicting a sex act, alleging misconduct against minorities.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta&#39;s internal review experts decided to permanently disable the account due to the consistent violations and calls for violence. This action was taken despite the number of strikes not reaching the ban threshold — <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://transparency.meta.com/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts/">Meta&#39;s guidance</a> states that even seven strikes only get users a one-day ban. However, its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/account-integrity/">account integrity page</a> lays out examples of when it will disable accounts, including violating its community standards through &quot;risk of imminent harm&quot; to an individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board is now looking for insight from the public until 11:59PM PT on Tuesday, February 3. The Board is specifically <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.oversightboard.com/pc/account-ban-for-targeting-public-figures/">seeking comments</a> from individuals who can &quot;contribute valuable perspectives&quot; on the following topics:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How best to ensure due process and fairness to people whose accounts are penalized or permanently disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>The effectiveness of measures used by social media platforms to protect public figures and journalists from accounts engaged in repeated abuse and threats of violence, in particular against women in the public eye.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenges in identifying and considering off-platform context when assessing threats against public figures and journalists.</p></li>
<li><p>Research into the efficacy of punitive measures to shape online behaviors, and the efficacy of alternative or complementary interventions.</p></li>
<li><p>Good industry practices in transparency reporting on account enforcement decisions and related appeals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This instance marks the first time the Board has looked into Meta permanently disabling an account. It stated that this &quot;represents a significant opportunity to provide users with greater transparency on Meta’s account enforcement policies and practices, make recommendations for improvement, and expand the types of cases the Board can review.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/metas-oversight-board-is-looking-into-transparency-around-disabling-accounts-145757717.html?src=rss]]></description>

The promotion runs through January 21.</p> 
<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adobe has announced updates for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/adobe-premiere-is-coming-to-ios-later-this-month-155019427.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Premiere</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-is-bringing-generative-ai-features-to-photoshop-after-effects-and-premiere-pro-130034491.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">After Effects</a>, including new AI-powered tools that are meant to speed up your video editing tasks. In Premiere, the company’s video-editing software, it has unveiled a new AI-powered Object Mask feature that lets you easily pick and track persons or objects moving through your video clips. You simply have to hover over that object and click to generate a mask overlay in seconds. While the mask is supposed to be accurate from the start, you can adjust and resize it as needed. Adobe says the feature uses its own AI model for the feature and that the processing happens on-device. It also says that it doesn’t use your activities and data to train its models.</p><p>The company has also given its Shape Mask tool an upgrade. You can generate its redesigned Ellipse, Rectangle and Pen masks directly from the toolbar. Further, it updated their controls to make moving or adjusting the masks more precise. The masks can now also track objects on your video clips 20 times faster than their predecessors, which means you won’t have to keep such a close eye on the status bar. Another new Premiere update lets you easily bring media from from Firefly Boards, Adobe’s AI-powered digital canvas, into the program. In addition,  Adobe Stock is now fully integrated within Premiere. </p><p>For After Effects, Adobe has rolled out an update that lets you import  SVG files that are commonly used in Illustrator. You can now also build graphics and photorealistic objects inside images with 3D parametric meshes, consisting of cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, toris and planes, within the visual effects software. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-unveils-new-ai-powered-video-editing-tools-for-premiere-140000970.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The start of the new year is a great time to get your finances in order, and a good budgeting app can help with that. Instead of laboring over a spreadsheet, you can try one of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">our favorite budgeting apps</a> for less than usual. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a> is running a sale that gives new users 50 percent off one year of the service, bringing the final cost down to just $50. Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarch.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have the best chance to save on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that&#39;s worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That&#39;s $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="b28a2c9fc4054925875eb91d0c7e1cbe" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.disneyplus.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK government has announced a consultation, asking people for their feedback on whether to introduce a social media ban for children under 16 years old. It would also explore how to enforce that limit, how to limit tech companies from being able to access children’s data and how to limit “infinite scrolling,” as well as access to addictive online tools. In addition to seeking feedback from parents and young people themselves, the country’s ministers are going to visit Australia to see the effects of the country’s social media ban for kids, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/15298c8c-d937-419c-8c9d-191589302704" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. </p><p>Australia&#39;s minimum age <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/australia-is-adding-twitch-to-its-social-media-ban-for-children-202033276.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">social media ban</a> went into effect on December 10. It’s the first of its kind and covers several social media platforms, including Facebook, X, TikTok, Twitch, Snapchat, YouTube and Reddit. Just recently, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-closes-550000-accounts-to-comply-with-australias-kids-social-media-ban-130041356.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Meta shut down</a> nearly 550,00 accounts, most of which were on Instagram, to comply with the new law. </p><p>The UK passed the Online Safety Act in 2023 and has been enforcing its rules since. Last year, for instance, it started <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">requiring websites</a> that publish pornography to conduct age checks for users. But British politician Liz Kendall said parents still have serious concerns about the content their children can consume online.  As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/jan/19/uk-ministers-launch-consultation-into-whether-to-ban-social-media-for-under-16s" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a> notes, the announcement for a consultation comes just before the House of Lords votes on an amendment to the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill. The amendment is seeking a social media ban on children under 16, which will be enacted within a year if and when the bill passes. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-uk-is-mulling-an-australia-like-social-media-ban-for-users-under-16-130000446.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Musk claims in the filing that he’s entitled to a chunk of the company’s recent $500 billion valuation, after contributing $38 million in “seed funding” during the AI company’s early years. It wasn’t just money — according to the filing, Musk helped advise on key employee recruitment, introductions with business contacts and startup advice.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, it’s because the lawsuit dates back to March 2024. It’s still going.</p>

<p>Claude Cowork, Anthropic’s AI assistant for handling simple tasks on your computer, is now available to anyone with a $20-per-month Pro subscription. It was previously an exclusive feature for its Max subscribers, who pay a minimum of $100 per month.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the intriguing part of Claude Cowork is its ability to work on its own. If you have the macOS Claude app and a Pro subscription, you can prompt Claude Cowork to work on tasks on your local computer, like creating documents based on files you have saved or organizing your folders. Don’t expect it to deal with high-level PC work just yet, but it can handle simple organizational tasks.</p>

<p>Pioneering mathematician Dr. Gladys West has passed away at the age of 95. Her name may not be familiar to you, but her contributions will be. West’s work laid the foundation for the global positioning system, GPS, we all use (sometimes daily).

<p>ASUS might step back from smartphones. According to translations of recent quotes from Chair Jonney Shih, the company does not plan to release new phone models in the future. Previous reports suggested ASUS would not introduce any smartphones in 2026, but Shih’s recent comments indicate the pause may last longer, if not indefinitely. We’ve reached out to ASUS for additional comment.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony is ceding control of its Bravia TV brand to China's TCL as part of a new "strategic partnership," the companies announced in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.sony.co.jp/en/news-release/202601/26-0120E/">joint press release</a>. The Japanese electronics giant plans to sell a majority 51 percent stake in its home entertainment arm to TCL, while retaining a 49 percent share. The joint venture is set to start operations in April 2027, pending regulatory and other approvals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new combined business will sell TVs carrying Sony and Bravia branding while using TCL's display technology. The partnership will also leverage Sony's picture and audio expertise, supply chain management and other areas of expertise. For its part, TCL will contribute its vertical supply chain strength, global market presence and end-to-end cost efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"By combining both companies' expertise, we aim to create new customer value in the home entertainment field," Sony CEO Kimio Maki said in a statement. "We expect to elevate our brand value, achieve greater scale and optimize the supply chain in order to deliver superior products and services to our customers," added TCL Electronics chairperson DU Juan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news will come as a shock to some, particularly in Japan, as Sony has been strongly associated with high-quality TVs since the Trinitron days. However, it's currently fighting in a low-margin TV business full of formidable competitors including Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL. The company has already sold off or closed other electronics operations, including PCs and tablets, and is barely hanging in with its smartphone business.</p>
<p>Sony effectively stopped making its own LCD and OLED panels some time ago, while TCL has increased its own production — having recently <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=41a362d6-d1bd-41a8-9337-2b4c1d5991e2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=purchased&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50Y2wuY29tL3NnL2VuL25ld3MvdGNscy1jc290LWJ1eXMtb3Zlci1zYW1zdW5nLWRpc3BsYXlzLWxjZC1wYW5lbC1wYXRlbnRzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MWEzNjJkNi1kMWJkLTQxYTgtOTMzNy0yYjRjMWQ1OTkxZTIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjbC5jb20vc2cvZW4vbmV3cy90Y2xzLWNzb3QtYnV5cy1vdmVyLXNhbXN1bmctZGlzcGxheXMtbGNkLXBhbmVsLXBhdGVudHMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfkUJjBUJ3HIGp2yFOKGjOxUm7x2rD09iF2DiT_ZUfAp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcl.com%2Fsg%2Fen%2Fnews%2Ftcls-csot-buys-over-samsung-displays-lcd-panel-patents" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tcl.com/sg/en/news/tcls-csot-buys-over-samsung-displays-lcd-panel-patents">purchased</a> LCD Panel patents from Samsung and taken over its plant in China. Other Japanese companies like Toshiba and Hitachi have already exited the TV business, while some including Panasonic have a highly reduced presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bravia brand survived mainly thanks to customers willing to pay extra for high-end picture and sound quality, along with Sony's association to filmmaking and high-end camera gear. As I detailed in a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html">recent explainer</a>, Sony was a pioneer in many key flat panel breakthroughs, having developed LED backlighting, quantum dot technology and the first OLED TVs.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-is-handing-control-of-its-bravia-tv-business-to-chinas-tcl-120957252.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-wireless-charger">What to look for in a wireless charger</h2> 
<p>While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">3-in-1 wireless charger</a> or full wireless charging station.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-where-and-how-will-you-use-your-charger">Where and how will you use your charger?</h2>

<p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours.</p> 
<p>For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-charging-performance">Wireless charging performance</h2> 
<p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility.</p> 
<p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p> 
<p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DGJ4QQ5W&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1fe3d1e8-55e1-40d5-a463-1336dd916f19&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=latest+MagSafe+charging+pad&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1hZ1NhZmUtQ2hhcmdlci1DYXBhYmlsaXR5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjBER0o0UVE1Vy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWZlM2QxZTgtNTVlMS00MGQ1LWE0NjMtMTMzNmRkOTE2ZjE5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1hZ1NhZmUtQ2hhcmdlci1DYXBhYmlsaXR5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjBER0o0UVE1Vy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf2JDWR8j2ixl2Us5tU8PS-hr3dpnlftRDq8cDXA8Pwd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ4QQ5W%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible/dp/B0DGJ4QQ5W/">latest MagSafe charging pad</a> can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-quality-and-box-contents">Quality and box contents</h2>

<p>Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link.</p> 
<p>Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs.</p> 
<p>You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-chargers-faqs">Wireless chargers FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-wireless-chargers-work-if-you-have-a-phone-case">Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case?</h3> 
<p>Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-know-if-my-phone-supports-wireless-charging">How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging?</h3> 
<p>Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.”</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-cords-charge-your-phone-faster">Do cords charge your phone faster?</h3> 
<p>Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss]]></description>

Her name may not be familiar to you, but her contributions certainly are; West&#39;s work laid the foundation for the global positioning system.

</div><p>West was born in 1930 in Virginia. Despite the oppression of Jim Crow laws in the south, she was able to pursue higher education at Virginia State College (now named Virginia State University), obtaining bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees in mathematics. In 1956, West was hired at what is now called the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, VA. Her focus during the 1970s and 1980s was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.war.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/article/3700859/navy-scientist-helped-develop-gps/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">creating</a> accurate models of the Earth&#39;s shape based on satellite data, a complex task requiring the type of mathematical gymnastics that would make the average person dizzy. Those models later became the backbone for GPS. West worked at the Dahlgren center for 42 years, retiring in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>As has been the case with so many of the women, particularly those of color, behind tech and science breakthroughs in the US, West&#39;s work went largely uncelebrated for decades. After submitting a short biography of her accomplishments to a sorority function in 2018, members of Alpha Kappa Alpha helped West to receive belated recognition for her contributions. She was inducted into the US Air Force Space and Missiles Pioneers Hall of Fame and honored as Female Alumna of the Year by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Awards in that same year. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/19/gladys-west-the-hidden-figure-who-helped-invent-gps" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a> published an interview with West in 2020 that shared some insights on her journey, including a note that when West was out and about, she favored paper maps over the technology she indirectly helped create.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/dr-gladys-west-whose-mathematical-models-inspired-gps-dies-at-95-234605023.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ASUS appears to be shifting its business operations away from smartphones. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/asus-confirms-it-wont-launch-phones-in-2026-may-leave-android-altogether?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&amp;test_variant=A" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">translations</a> of recent quotes from Chairman Jonney Shih, the company does not plan to release new phone models in the future. The chairman did not confirm whether smartphones would be completely phased out, but he did acknowledge that possibility. Whatever direction ASUS takes, its existing phones will continue to receive software updates and warranty assistance. Shih suggested that its future plans may include a shift into AI-related projects such as robotics or smartglasses.</p><p>Previous <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260102PD236/smartphone-asus-taiwan-mobile-market.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reports</a> hinted that ASUS would not introduce any smartphones in 2026, but Shih&#39;s recent comments indicate that the pause may stretch longer than a year. We&#39;ve reached out to ASUS for additional comment and will update if the company shares any further information.&nbsp;</p><p>ASUS had plenty of other updates emerging from CES at the start of the month unrelated to smartphones, such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-asus-zenbook-duo-got-a-fantastic-redesign-for-ces-2026-173000392.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">dual-screen</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">laptops</a> and a pair of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">gaming smartglasses</a>. So if it does decide to leave that product segment, there will still be other ASUS-branded gear on the market. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/asus-will-not-release-any-new-smartphones-this-year-213043832.html?src=rss]]></description>

At a conference in Barcelona, the commission&#39;s Executive Director Tim Miller criticized Meta&#39;s behavior towards advertisements for online gambling on its Facebook and Instagram social networks.</p><p>&quot;Companies like Meta will tell you that they don’t tolerate the advertising of illegal sites and will remove them if they are notified about them,&quot; Miller&#39;s speech transcript <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/ice-barcelona-2026-tim-miller-speech" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reads</a>. &quot;But that approach suggests that they don’t know about those ads unless alerted. That is simply false.&quot;</p><p>Meta&#39;s internal <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=58a137b8-4748-4ad2-b1db-003c79a332f5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ffc49933-c6b0-4df4-92f7-55ecc8fe6659&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Facebook&amp;linkText=policy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaGVscC80NzQwMzI1OTg5MzQwODU2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZmM0OTkzMy1jNmIwLTRkZjQtOTJmNy01NWVjYzhmZTY2NTkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWxwLzQ3NDAzMjU5ODkzNDA4NTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVBrJifMvrdqBaSigqxQPN0_eYolx603g6lnq0KR_QZI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F4740325989340856" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Facebook;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/4740325989340856">policy</a> is that gambling sites must be licensed in the markets where their ads run. However, the agency was able to conduct basic searches for advertisers that are not on its GamStop platform, which helps people block themselves from accessing online gambling sites. GamStop integration is required for an operator to receive a UK license.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I would be very surprised if Meta, as one of the world’s largest tech companies is incapable of proactively using their own keyword facility to prevent the advertising of illegal gambling,&quot; Miller said. &quot;It could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking money from criminals and scammers until someone shouts about it.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/uk-agency-questions-metas-policies-for-illegal-gambling-site-ads-210500714.html?src=rss]]></description>

Alongside a definitive release date, Bungie shared a new gameplay trailer, in addition to details about the game&#39;s forthcoming deluxe edition, which fans can pre-order today on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. All versions of the game will support crossplay, meaning you&#39;ll be able to play with your friends, no matter where they decide to buy <em>Marathon</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Sony, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buy-bungie-destiny-studio-180905449.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Bungie&#39;s parent company</a>, had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-in-march-200838426.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">previously committed to a March release</a> for <em>Marathon</em>, but stopped short of sharing an exact date.

It&#39;s safe to say <em>Marathon </em>could decide the future of the studio. In November, Sony said <em>Destiny 2</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-says-destiny-2-has-not-met-expectations-200000610.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">had not lived up to its expectations</a> and wrote down the value of the studio’s assets by $204 million. This came after the company said it would take more direct control of Bungie. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Dojo team had been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/tesla-shuts-down-in-house-dojo-ai-supercomputer-project-155420734.html"><ins>disbanded last year</ins></a> as the company prioritized the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-wins-165-billion-deal-to-make-teslas-ai6-chips-124515017.html"><ins>AI chips</ins></a> that run on board Tesla vehicles. Musk said the company is returning to the project &quot;now that the AI5 chip design is in good shape.&quot;</p>
<p>The purpose of the Dojo project is to process video recordings and other data from Tesla vehicles and use that <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-autonomous-driving-091123615.html"><ins>to train</ins></a> the &quot;neural net&quot; behind the company&#39;s Full Self-Driving software. Last year, however, Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1953660184351707210"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that &quot;It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs.

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from the usual $160, and League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. Considering we&#39;re almost halfway though the season, the discount makes sense and is a good deal for anyone who wants to keep a close eye on the rest of the games to be played this year.</p> 
<p>The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="5e40023bdb824a11adc46b45eac49663" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.nba.com/league-pass-purchase"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Last year, League Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html">added multiview</a>, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.</p> 
<p>Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.</p>

Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D54JZTHY&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=24b60c33-f851-4bee-9d8b-9c00c8cc034a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=AirTags&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRiNjBjMzMtZjg1MS00YmVlLTlkOGItOWMwMGM4Y2MwMzRhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR-tHxD_n-S9V6FZTggBPzQxNCDZMIugRbDnHNS6azZ_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?">AirTags</a> for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we&#39;ve seen for these Bluetooth trackers.</p>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta’s Threads is pulling further ahead of Elon Musk’s X on mobile, based on recent estimates from analytics firm Similarweb, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2026/01/16/threads-widens-lead-over-musks-x-zuckerbergs-platform-adds-millions/"><em><ins>Forbes</ins></em></a> reports. In the first stretch of January, Threads averaged roughly 143 million daily active users worldwide on mobile devices, compared with about 126 million for X.</p>
<p>Similarweb’s year-over-year snapshot shows <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-reaches-150-million-daily-users-and-is-ramping-up-ads-214259945.html"><ins>Threads growing sharply</ins></a>, up 37.8 percent year-over-year, while X’s daily mobile audience fell 11.9 percent across the same period. The picture is more mixed in the US, where X still holds a narrow edge on mobile. Similarweb data puts X at about 21.2 million daily active US mobile users in early January versus roughly 19.5 million for Threads.</p>

You can whip one out at a party or event and take a snap, then a couple of minutes later you have a real, physical, instant photo that everyone can touch, feel and enjoy instead of staring at a screen. It’s also a lot cooler than a smartphone shot thanks to the retro, nostalgic vibes of analog photography.<br><br>Given the large number of camera brands on the market, choosing one can be tricky. That’s why we’ve put together this buying guide that will help you choose the best instant camera for you based on factors like price, instant film size, photo quality and more.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-an-instant-camera">What to consider before buying an instant camera</h2> 
<p>The main factor for most people is the size of the film. When most people think of retro instant cameras, they think of a square image size. That’s why Instagram, which used to have a Polaroid-like app icon, only supported square images for years. If that’s what you want, then Fuji’s Square or either of Polaroid’s formats are best.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>However, if you want as large an image as possible, Fujifilm’s Instax wide is the way to go. For those who prefer a smaller size to pin on their fridge or slip in an envelope (or the cheaper film), Fujifilim’s Instax Mini or Polaroid’s Go format are best.</p> 
<p>With that in mind, here are the choices. Fujifilm’s Instax alone offers three formats: Mini, Square and Wide, with film sizes of 3.4 x 2.1 inches, 3.4 x 2.8 inches and 3.4 x 4.3 inches. The corresponding image sizes are 2.44 x 1.81 inches, 2.44 x 2.44 inches and 2.44 x 3.9 inches.</p> 
<p>Leica’s Sofort 2 and Lomography models also uses Fujifilm’s Mini format, while Polaroid’s smaller Go format is 2.64 x 2.13 inches (1.81 x 1.83-inch image) and its i-Type size is 3.46 x 4.21 inches, with a square image size of 3.11 x 3.11 inches.</p> 
<p>As for prices, Fujifilm’s Instax films are generally around $1 - $1.20 per shot for square or wide color film and $.60 - $.75 for mini color film. Those prices go up a bit if you choose custom models with colorful or patterned borders, and down if you buy in bulk. Polaroid’s i-Type film is a bit more at about $2.00 per shot or $1.00 - $1.35 per shot for Go color film.</p> 
<p>Image quality isn’t really the point with instant cameras of course, as they’re always going to be fuzzy compared to digital photos. However, some models (notably Fujifilm and Polaroid models) are a bit better than others.</p> 
<p>And in terms of pricing for the cameras themselves, models with larger film are generally more expensive. It also increases if you add hybrid features like USB-C connectivity, smartphone sharing, the ability to print out photos and more, along with niceties like a selfie mirror. The best, most feature-laden cameras can cost upwards of $200 and basic versions can be well under $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-instant-camera-120034778.html?src=rss]]></description>

The latest &quot;out-of-band&quot; update repairs an issue for some Windows 11 devices that would only restart when users tried to shut down or hibernate. The same update restores the ability for Windows 10 and Windows 11 users to log into their devices via remote connection apps.</p>
<p>Microsoft said the inability to shut down or hibernate affected Windows 11 devices using Secure Launch, a security feature that protects a computer from firmware-level attacks during startup. As for the remote connection issue, Microsoft explained in its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-server-2025#3760msgdesc">Known issues page</a> that credential prompt failures were responsible when users tried to log in remotely to affected Windows 10 and 11 devices.</p>

<p>This is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">our top pick</a> for a 3-in-1 charging pad thanks to its versatility. The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Washington state residents may soon be forced to produce IDs before getting onto websites with pornographic content. Within the state&#39;s House of Representatives, Rep. Mari Leavitt introduced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?BillNumber=2112&amp;Year=2025&amp;Initiative=false">House Bill 2112</a>, which is informally known as the Keep Our Children Safe Act. Similar to the initiatives seen in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/louisiana-government-id-to-access-porn-online-065536172.html">other states</a>, the bill proposes to restrict access to &quot;online sexual material harmful&quot; to anyone under 18.</p>
<p>In practical terms, those living in Washington state could see websites asking for digital identification or demanding the user go through an age verification system that requests a government-issued ID. If a website that has more than one-third of its content being &quot;sexual material harmful to minors&quot; is found not following these rules, the state&#39;s attorney general can pursue steep civil penalties.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If those restrictions sound familiar, it&#39;s because many <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">other states</a> have also passed similar constraints. Washington state&#39;s proposed bill is very similar to Texas&#39; age verification law that went into effect in September 2023 and was recently upheld by the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/supreme-court-upholds-texass-porn-site-age-verification-law-155007840.html">US Supreme Court</a>. Like the Texas law, several groups expressed disapproval of the bill during the public hearing at the House committee level. As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-age-verification-bill-targets-access-to-online-adult-content/"><em>The Seattle Times</em></a><em>, </em>groups including the ACLU, Lavender Rights Project and the Northwest Progressive Institute warned of privacy risks related to potential data breaches and the loose definition of &quot;sexual material harmful to minors&quot; in the bill&#39;s language.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/washington-is-the-latest-state-pursuing-an-age-verification-law-for-porn-sites-174423529.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Las Vegas deal ultimately &quot;didn&#39;t come to fruition,&quot; spokesperson Sara Collins told<em> </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Las Vegas Sun</em></a> this week, and Atari Hotels is putting its focus into the Phoenix site &quot;for the time being.&quot;</p><p>Phoenix was always meant to be the first site, followed by other hotels in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. But Las Vegas is now apparently off the table, and there haven&#39;t been any signs of life around the other planned locations. The FAQ on the Atari Hotels website notes, &quot;Additional sites, including Denver, are being explored under separate development and licensing agreements.&quot; The Atari Hotel project was announced in 2020 just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and consequently experienced development delays. Construction on the Phoenix hotel, which was supposed to break ground in 2020, is expected to begin late this year, with its opening now planned for 2028.&nbsp;</p><p>But maybe don&#39;t hold your breath. According to a December press release, the company is still trying to raise $35 million to $40 million to fund the &quot;playable destination&quot; for gamers in Phoenix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-plan-for-a-gaming-themed-atari-hotel-in-las-vegas-has-reportedly-been-scrapped-214212269.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is reportedly adding Teresa Palmer (<em>The Fall Guy, Warm Bodies, Hacksaw Ridge</em>) to its pantheon of Norse gods for its <em>God of War</em> TV show adaptation. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, Palmer will play Sif, Thor&#39;s wife and eventual leader of the Aesir, in the live-action adaptation. It may not carry as much weight as the casting of the video game&#39;s protagonist that was revealed earlier this week to be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html">Ryan Hurst</a>, but it could hint at the direction the TV show may take.</p>

<p>While Sif plays a minor role in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a> game, the early casting confirmation could indicate that the showrunner, Ronald D. Moore, may give the character a more involved role. In <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, Sif is known as Odin&#39;s diplomat before the events of Ragnarok, where she becomes the new leader of the Aesir, one of two tribes of Norse gods. Notably, Amazon&#39;s adaptation is still missing the casting confirmations for Atreus, Thor, Odin and many other Norse gods seen in the video game. Even so, the <em>God of War</em> TV show has already secured at least <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/amazons-god-of-war-adaptation-gets-a-two-season-order-133059803.html">two seasons</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In another attempt to reduce our attention spans to mush, TikTok has released the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinedrama/id6754134922">PineDrama</a> app, which offers serialized drama series that are roughly a minute per episode. As first spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-launches-a-new-micro-drama-app-called-pinedrama-2026-1"><em>Business Insider</em></a>, the app is designed exactly like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html">TikTok</a>, but instead of trendy dance videos, you can scroll through and watch &quot;micro dramas.&quot;</p>
<p>For those new to the category, micro dramas are bite-sized TV shows shot in vertical video and available in minute-long episodes. Don&#39;t expect any nominations for Best Original Screenplay with series like <em>The Officer Fell For Me </em>or<em> Married to my past life&#39;s nemesis</em>, since they typically offer soap opera vibes with cliffhangers that keep users scrolling to the next episode. The app is designed to keep people on it with a Discover tab, a place to save favorites and the ability to react in real time alongside other viewers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Right now, the micro dramas on PineDrama are all free to watch and don&#39;t have any ads. It&#39;s unclear if TikTok will introduce any costs or ads to the app, since other micro drama options like DramaBox or ReelShort have a paid structure. Late last year, TikTok also introduced a way to watch micro dramas within its own app, with a section called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-jumps-into-micro-dramas-buzzy-bite-sized-soaps-2025-12">Minis</a>. It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;re seeing shorter TV show formats, since Quibi made waves with a format of episodes that were less than 10 minutes long. However, maybe even 10 minutes was too long since the startup eventually <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/quibi-shut-down-155124687.html">called it quits</a> after eight months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tiktoks-latest-spinoff-app-feels-a-lot-like-quibi-but-with-shorter-and-cornier-content-185702010.html?src=rss]]></description>

The savings vary depending on the bundle you configure, but this can bring your out-the-door cost down to $449 from $529 for the tablet, Marker stylus and polymer weave book folio. The offer runs through January 17.</p> 
<p>The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best e-ink tablet</a>. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-tablet-e-ink-hands-on-review-marker-writing-note-taking-130044070.html">review</a>, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable.</p> 
<p>The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn&#39;t think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless.</p> 
<p>The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges.</p> 
<p>The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet. The pricier tablet also has bundle deals right now with savings up to $80 depending on configuration.</p>

As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the latest filing, as part of a lawsuit that accuses the AI giant of abandoning its non-profit status, claims that Musk is owed anywhere between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages from the &quot;wrongful gains&quot; of OpenAI and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Musk claimed in the filing that he&#39;s entitled to a portion of OpenAI&#39;s recent valuation at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-private-company-at-500-billion-133028221.html">$500 billion</a>, after contributing $38 million in &quot;seed funding&quot; during the AI company&#39;s startup years. Along with providing &quot;roughly 60 percent of the nonprofit&#39;s seed funding,&quot; Musk offered recruiting of key employees, introductions with business contacts and startup advice, according to the filing. The monetary estimate comes from C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist who&#39;s serving as Musk&#39;s expert in the case. According to Wazzan&#39;s calculations, OpenAI earned between $65.5 billion and $109.43 billion in wrongful gains, while Microsoft saw between $13.3 billion and $25.06 billion.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AirPods work most smoothly with Apple hardware, but they also connect reliably to Android phones, Windows laptops and other Bluetooth devices. The pairing process depends on the platform in use although the basics remain the same. Once the AirPods are placed in pairing mode, most devices detect them quickly and handle the remaining steps in the background. The guide below explains how to pair AirPods with Apple products, how the process differs on newer iPhones that support H2 features and how to connect them to non-Apple devices.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pair-airpods-with-apple-devices">How to pair AirPods with Apple devices</h2><p>Apple builds AirPods to pair almost instantly with devices in its own ecosystem. Opening the charging case near an unlocked iPhone or iPad usually brings up an on-screen prompt. Tapping <strong>Connect</strong> links the earbuds to the device and to every other Apple product signed into the same iCloud account. After that, switching between devices is automatic. Audio output follows the active device as long as each product is using updated software and is signed in with the same Apple ID.</p><p>If the pairing prompt does not appear, there are a few simple checks that help things move along. Opening the <strong>Control Center</strong> and selecting the audio output menu confirms whether the AirPods already appear as an available device. If they are listed there, choosing them establishes the connection. If they do not appear, opening the <strong>Settings</strong> app and checking <strong>Bluetooth</strong> usually reveals whether the AirPods are in range or already recognized. Opening the case while viewing the Bluetooth menu often triggers the pairing card once more.</p><p>The process is similar across Apple Watch and Mac. When the AirPods are already linked to an iPhone, they tend to show up automatically on a paired Apple Watch. On Mac, opening <strong>System Settings</strong> and viewing the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> section reveals the same device list seen on an iPhone. Selecting the AirPods from that list completes the connection and also syncs the pairing status back to every other Apple device using the same account.</p><h2 id="jump-link-enhanced-pairing-with-newer-iphones">Enhanced pairing with newer iPhones</h2><p>Some newer iPhones support features enabled by the H2 chip used in newer AirPods models. With compatible AirPods, models such as iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and the iPhone 16 lineup tend to deliver a faster and more responsive setup experience. When an AirPods case is opened near one of these phones, the device quickly detects the earbuds and displays the pairing card with little delay. This also tends to speed up transitions between devices and improves reliability when switching audio sources.</p><p>If the fast pairing prompt does not appear on a newer iPhone, reopening the case while the phone is unlocked is usually enough to reinitiate the process. It also helps to confirm that Bluetooth is turned on. Placing the AirPods back in the case for a few seconds and trying again will often reset the pairing state if the earbuds were connected elsewhere.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/fc3e54e0-c61d-11f0-a4db-6ace49d303da" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/fc3e54e0-c61d-11f0-a4db-6ace49d303da" style="height:1347px;width:2560px;" alt="AirPods Pro 3" data-uuid="ae83d4b4-39cf-36ff-9422-72c881ba45e2"/><figcaption>AirPods Pro 3</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-put-airpods-into-pairing-mode">How to put AirPods into pairing mode</h2><p>Every AirPods model supports a manual pairing mode. This is essential when linking the earbuds to devices outside the Apple ecosystem, or when the automatic prompt fails to appear on an iPhone or Mac.   On older AirPods models, pairing mode is activated by opening the lid and pressing and holding the setup button on the back of the case until the LED light flashes white. Newer models, including AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 3, use a touch-based method instead. With the lid open, tapping the area near the LED light places the earbuds into pairing mode. Leaving the lid open keeps the AirPods discoverable for nearby devices. Closing the case ends the process and requires it to be repeated if the device fails to detect them.</p><p>Pairing mode does not remove any previous connections. It simply makes the AirPods available to new devices, which is helpful when switching between ecosystems. However, connecting to a new device usually takes priority. If the AirPods are already linked to something else that is nearby, turning off Bluetooth on the previously connected device prevents interference and helps the new device detect them more easily.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pair-airpods-with-android-devices">How to pair AirPods with Android devices</h2><p>Although AirPods are designed for Apple hardware, they function like any other Bluetooth earbuds on Android. Opening the case and placing the AirPods in pairing mode allows Android phones to detect them through the standard <strong>Bluetooth</strong> menu. The earbuds appear in the list of available devices and selecting them initiates the connection. Once paired, AirPods work for calls and media playback. Some features, such as automatic ear detection and battery status indicators, may require a third-party app on Android and are not supported at a system level. Features such as spatial audio and device switching remain exclusive to Apple’s ecosystem but day-to-day performance is consistent on Android.</p><p>If the AirPods fail to appear, refreshing the Bluetooth device list on the Android phone usually helps. Making sure the earbuds are still in pairing mode is essential since the white LED indicator stops flashing after a short period. Reopening the case and holding the button again, or tapping on the front for newer models, restores discoverability.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pair-airpods-with-windows-laptops">How to pair AirPods with Windows laptops</h2><p>Windows 11 handles AirPods as a regular audio device. Opening the <strong>Bluetooth and Devices</strong> menu in <strong>System Settings</strong> displays a list of nearby accessories. With the AirPods in pairing mode, the laptop should detect them and display them as an audio device. Selecting them completes the process and adds the earbuds to the device’s known accessories. Windows generally reconnects to AirPods automatically on future sessions as long as Bluetooth remains enabled.</p><p>If the earbuds do not appear in the list, toggling Bluetooth off and back on helps the system refresh the device scan. Checking whether the AirPods are already linked to a different device is another useful step. Windows sometimes struggles to take over a connection when the earbuds remain in range of a previously paired phone so disabling Bluetooth on the other device often resolves the issue.</p><h2 id="jump-link-troubleshooting-common-pairing-issues">Troubleshooting common pairing issues</h2><p>Most pairing problems come down to the AirPods not being in discoverable mode or being connected to another device nearby. Resetting the earbuds solves many problems. On AirPods models with a setup button, placing the AirPods in the case, leaving the lid open and holding the button until the LED turns amber then white restores the factory pairing state. On newer models without a physical button, place the AirPods in the case, close the lid for about 30 seconds, then open it and quickly tap the front of the case three times. The status light should then flash amber and then white, to indicate that the reset is complete. This clears previous connections and makes the AirPods behave as if they are new out of the box.&nbsp;</p><p>Low battery levels can also interrupt pairing. Ensuring both the earbuds and the case have enough charge prevents unexpected disconnections during setup. Interference from other wireless accessories affects pairing on crowded networks. Moving to a quieter spot or turning off surrounding Bluetooth devices helps the AirPods stand out when scanning.</p><p>AirPods are built to pair quickly with Apple devices but they also integrate smoothly with other platforms. Keeping the earbuds in pairing mode and confirming that Bluetooth is enabled on the device in use ensures a smooth setup every time. Once connected, the AirPods tend to remember the device and reconnect whenever they are nearby which keeps day-to-day use simple regardless of the platform.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-pair-airpods-with-any-device-140000234.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, even an expert review is subjective, and there&#39;s a chance CyberGhost will not work for you. If that’s the case, here&#39;s how to cancel your subscription.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-stop-your-cyberghost-subscription-renewing"><strong>How to stop your CyberGhost subscription renewing</strong></h2><p>Cancelling your CyberGhost subscription won&#39;t end it right away, unless you delete your account or get the refund (I&#39;ll explain how to do both of those later). Instead, the way to cancel CyberGhost is to stop your subscription from renewing at the end of each billing period. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can keep using CyberGhost until your current period ends.</p><p>The following steps will cancel auto-renewal if you got CyberGhost through its website. If you bought it through an app store instead, see the next section.</p><ol><li><p>Open your browser and go to <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eb43eed0-f954-43d3-964f-bfeb8e845bd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViNDNlZWQwLWY5NTQtNDNkMy05NjRmLWJmZWI4ZTg0NWJkOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAU-Gf6nZo62L9GIIKc76mweGLaqSbTDQX2mLoNjPWUrb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>At the top-right of the screen, click the box labeled <strong>My Account</strong>.

The next time you would have been billed, your subscription will expire. You can resubscribe by purchasing another term.

If you bought CyberGhost through an app store and want to cancel, you&#39;ll have to ask the app store in question, not CyberGhost. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p><p>If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, you&#39;ll need to cancel through your Apple ID.

If you don&#39;t, you might still be charged for the subscription you&#39;re not using, and it&#39;s a huge hassle to end that without an account.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve done that, log into your account on <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eb43eed0-f954-43d3-964f-bfeb8e845bd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViNDNlZWQwLWY5NTQtNDNkMy05NjRmLWJmZWI4ZTg0NWJkOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAU-Gf6nZo62L9GIIKc76mweGLaqSbTDQX2mLoNjPWUrb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a> and click on your account profile at the top-right, just like when you canceled auto-renewal.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. Several neat-looking games arrived this week, we got release dates for several others that I&#39;m <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heist-game-relooted-gets-a-release-date-173456541.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">really looking forward to</a> and a brand-new Steam festival was announced.&nbsp;</p><p>The Love, Romance, and Heartbreak Debutante Ball is said to be the first Valentine&#39;s Day-themed Steam festival. It&#39;ll run from February 13 to 20 and feature more than 100 games, including discounts and demos. A showcase will take place on February 13 at 1PM ET on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHFkzHblsQfyuQF-mR-MPA" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Sunny Demeanor Games YouTube channel</a> too.</p><p>Organizers say the festival includes a wide variety of games about love, including RPGs, puzzle games and (naturally) visual novels. You might play as a cat or someone trying to fish an engagement ring out of a claw machine, as a secret agent or a couple that&#39;s run off to another planet. I&#39;m intrigued! There will be some NSFW games involved, for what it&#39;s worth.</p><h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn1pi1UKJXc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check </em>seems like a 3D version of <em>Papers Please</em> but with zombies. At a checkpoint amid a zombie outbreak, your mission is to screen survivors for signs of infection. If you&#39;re unsure of their status, you can send an individual to quarantine for further observation or a lab for additional screening. Otherwise, you can let them in or send them to &quot;liquidation.&quot; Get things wrong and it could spell disaster, but at least you have a sidearm (and a weaponized drone) to help you deal with sticky situations.</p><p>It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check,</em> which is from Brigada Games and publisher Devolver Digital. There are base and resource management aspects as well. It&#39;s out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam</a> (usually $20, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until January 26) and PC Game Pass.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1c9juK-z7Fw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Air Hares</em> seems to draw inspiration from classic top-down shoot-&#39;em-ups. But instead of simply blowing up countless ships, your mission is to restore farmland. You&#39;ll fire seeds and water to turn barren land into fertile carrot fields. There are still enemies to contend with — you (and perhaps a co-op partner) can dodge and ram them as you try to protect the land.&nbsp;Expect boss battles, too.</p><p>I really like the aesthetic here. It has a &#39;90s-style cartoon look (I suddenly really want a modern Bucky O&#39;Hare game). Also, the song from the trailer is going to live in my head for weeks.</p><p>Husband-and-wife team Tim and Megan Bungeroth created <em>Air Hares </em>over six years with the help of several contributors. According to a press release, the game is &quot;inspired by the creators’ personal journey with infertility and the idea of creating life rather than destroying it.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Air Hares</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Steam</a>. It typically costs $9, but there&#39;s a 20 percent discount until January 28.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpEAiQ5BCqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Luckshot Games&#39; <em>Big Hops</em> looks like my kind of 3D platformer: joyous and playful. As a young frog who has been kidnapped, you&#39;ll try to find airship parts for a raccoon who has promised to help get you home.</p><p>There are tons of movement mechanics here, and Hop&#39;s tongue plays a major role in those. You can use it to swing across gaps, hookshot your way to higher platforms and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Big Hops</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221480/Big_Hops/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/big-hops-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016219" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">PS5</a> for $20. The Switch and Steam versions have a 10 percent launch discount until January 19.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXk4QbJthX8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Cassette Boy </em>is a pixel-art game that might appear to be a 2D exploration puzzler, but there&#39;s more going on here. You can rotate the world to discover new secrets and hide enemies and hazards from view so you can move past them. If you can&#39;t see something on your screen, it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s a bit of a <em>Fez </em>influence here, it would appear.</p><p>Wonderland Kazakiri and publisher Pocketpair are behind this one, which I&#39;m looking forward to checking out when I have a chance. <em>Cassette Boy </em>is available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cassette-boy-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Switch</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016744" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">PS4, PS5</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=65a90182-7193-42ba-8fdd-e43829c445b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+One+and+Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9jYXNzZXR0ZS1ib3kvOU5DTlJIS0cySDQ0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NWE5MDE4Mi03MTkzLTQyYmEtOGZkZC1lNDM4MjljNDQ1YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2Nhc3NldHRlLWJveS85TkNOUkhLRzJINDQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcgUS1P_S6SZc3gQOZUAPu-jnXaxMK7syPIPSyWIV-6w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fcassette-boy%2F9NCNRHKG2H44" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cassette-boy/9NCNRHKG2H44">Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S</a> for $13.</p><h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akOVT_R3QXY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-spooky-nes-platformer-more-n-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000259.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">I really enjoyed the demo</a> for <em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em> (as well as Aerial_Knight’s previous games).

You compete with four enemies to grab the only available parachute as you&#39;re falling through the air.

It&#39;s designed to be a playable cartoon (with a runtime of about eight hours) and it has an art style to match.&nbsp;</p><p>The cast is pretty stellar, with Ben Starr (<em>Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II</em>), Joel Fry (<em>Our Flag Means Death</em>) and a whole load of British comedy figures on board. There&#39;s a demo available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">Steam</a> now and the full game — from Size Five Games and publisher No More Robots — will land on January 27.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3EZWYCHknCU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Let&#39;s wrap things up for this week something very silly-looking from Monster Shop Games. <em>Pie in the Sky </em>is a Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater-inspired action arcade game in which you play as a magpie that terrorizes bystanders. You can knock people off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, ram kids off of scooters, actually go skateboarding and, uh, cause havoc from above. In classic <em>THPS</em>-style, there are hidden areas too.&nbsp;</p><p>This looks like a fun distraction from [gestures at everything]. <em>Pie is the Sky</em> will swoop onto <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941360/Pie_in_the_Sky/" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">Steam</a> on February 2.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/papers-please-but-with-zombies-a-farming-based-shoot-em-up-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-123000437.html?src=rss]]></description>

There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.<br><br>On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It&#39;s easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure.

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn&#39;t crack our top list above, but we&#39;re summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former&#39;s no-nonsense privacy and the latter&#39;s healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe&#39;s server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn&#39;t copy the most important part of Proton VPN&#39;s free plan — the unlimited data. You&#39;re only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn&#39;t enough for regular streaming. It&#39;s also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-private-internet-access"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=Private+Internet+Access&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb2xZhJgbuYJ1Fdt6xW-K50AZouRlBZmdjdZsNQwkI8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h3> 
<p>Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it&#39;s a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won&#39;t see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.</p> 
<p>PIA&#39;s apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html">PIA VPN review</a>.</p> 
<p>The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA&#39;s apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren&#39;t directly reflected in the speed tests. It&#39;s also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it&#39;s heavily bulked out by virtual locations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it&#39;s far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:VyprVPN;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1ac8eebf-61d7-4584-9f21-7053ac17ead1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=VyprVPN&amp;linkText=VyprVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52eXBydnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudnlwcnZwbi5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATWG0NqEJnfLwacpOW9Xap1dcDWgI9JL41k8O7ZSdLor&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vyprvpn.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn&#39;t crack the VPN encryption itself). It&#39;s also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn&#39;t make the top seven because its connection speeds aren&#39;t up to scratch — you&#39;ll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It&#39;s a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn&#39;t to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won&#39;t find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We&#39;re here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren&#39;t always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla&#39;s speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it&#39;s actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it&#39;s using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN&#39;s origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It&#39;s a dealbreaker if you can&#39;t figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you&#39;ll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it&#39;s available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you&#39;re comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p>

<p>To wrap up, let&#39;s answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don&#39;t cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we&#39;re talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you&#39;re assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it&#39;s possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN&#39;s servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won&#39;t trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN&#39;s IP address, not yours. If you&#39;re interested in more detail, I&#39;ve written a whole article on <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">how a VPN works</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN&#39;s IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn&#39;t blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN&#39;s homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn&#39;t mean that authorities can&#39;t detect that it&#39;s being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It&#39;s no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there&#39;s nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you&#39;re using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can&#39;t do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that&#39;s concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there&#39;s very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before.</p> 
<p>All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html">secretly working off the same backend</a>. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you&#39;re free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google&#39;s One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you&#39;re a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don&#39;t recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

And it discounted compelling testimony from browser makers like Apple and Mozilla who said they choose to feature Google because it provides the highest quality search experience for their consumers.”</p><p>The company says that the requirement that it “provide syndication services to rivals” and share search data is a privacy risk and could “discourage competitors from building their own products.” Both remedies where compromises based on what the Justice Department originally proposed, which included <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/department-of-justice-confirms-that-it-wants-google-to-sell-off-chrome-094929822.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser</a>. </p><p>After <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a 10-week trial</a> held in 2023, Google was found to have a search monopoly in 2024 because of the placement it maintained <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">as the default search engine</a> on multiple platforms, and the control it exerted over the ads that appear in search results.

I mainly put it on my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPN</a> list because it&#39;s so cheap, but I wouldn&#39;t have done that if it didn&#39;t earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all.</p>
<p>My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that&#39;s not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that&#39;s not a bad thing — especially at such a low price.</p>
<p>Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it&#39;s got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I&#39;ll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-installing-configuring-and-using-cyberghost">Installing, configuring and using CyberGhost</h2>
<p>CyberGhost gets installation and UI largely right. There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don&#39;t overload you with needless information. I&#39;ve broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3>
<p>CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn&#39;t even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault.</p>

<p>Once inside, you&#39;re greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it&#39;s not broken, don&#39;t fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn&#39;t open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name.</p>
<p>To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can&#39;t argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3>
<p>The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It&#39;s best to download directly from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5YzRlNDcwLTBkNDctNGY3OS1iYTg0LTRjNGMwOWE5ODdlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYX7tTagjB-oRngJXvg0K0XJtWIMFT26Kdu8C0caoEyb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a>, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers.</p>
<p>Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it&#39;s in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there&#39;s not much reason to ever leave it pinned.</p>

<p>The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it&#39;s permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list.</p>
<p>Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab.</p>

<p>Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn&#39;t give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-android">Android</h3>
<p>CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It&#39;s nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I&#39;d clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren&#39;t too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn&#39;t do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. &quot;Anonymous statistics&quot; and &quot;Share network data for troubleshooting&quot; sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting.</p>
<p>Still, I&#39;m nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost&#39;s Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren&#39;t necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3>
<p>Much like its Android app, CyberGhost&#39;s iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest.</p>

<p>The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3>
<p>CyberGhost doesn&#39;t have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won&#39;t find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location.</p>
<p>However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">how a VPN works</a>. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they&#39;re no substitute for a full VPN. They&#39;re free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don&#39;t get caught, but they aren&#39;t secure.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-speed-test">CyberGhost speed test</h2>
<p>I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here&#39;s what each metric means in the table below:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p><strong>Ping, </strong>measured in <strong>milliseconds (ms), </strong>is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Download speed, </strong>measured in <strong>megabits per second (Mbps), </strong>is what you probably think of as &quot;internet speed&quot; — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Upload speed, </strong>also measured in <strong>Mbps, </strong>determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It&#39;s useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls.</p></li>

<p>CyberGhost&#39;s speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost&#39;s 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Surfshark</a>, currently the fastest VPN overall.</p>

<p>Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s.</p>
<p>As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It&#39;s just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-security-test">CyberGhost security test</h2>
<p>VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it&#39;s using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it&#39;s being applied equally to all data packets. Let&#39;s get started.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3>
<p>CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. <strong>OpenVPN, </strong>available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. <strong>WireGuard, </strong>supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. <strong>IKEv2, </strong>which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn&#39;t open-source.</p>
<p>I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn&#39;t make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can&#39;t complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3>
<p>I used <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a> to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak).</p>

</figure>
<p>CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there&#39;s no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn&#39;t find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server&#39;s IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn&#39;t leaking.</p>
<p>There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It&#39;s annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you&#39;ll be fine.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3>
<p>For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-much-does-cyberghost-cost">How much does CyberGhost cost?</h2>
<p>CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" style="height:1576px;width:3418px;" alt="These prices are subject to change." data-uuid="99bfda39-6767-47ff-bcd8-00601369b0a7">

<p>One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That&#39;s still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-side-apps-and-bundles">CyberGhost side apps and bundles</h2>
<p>CyberGhost doesn&#39;t have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that&#39;s honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it&#39;s nice to see a VPN that&#39;s content with just being a VPN.</p>
<p>CyberGhost does have a broader &quot;security suite,&quot; but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the &quot;Extra features&quot; section below.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-dedicated-ip">Dedicated IP</h3>
<p>You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you&#39;ll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It&#39;s also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-close-reading-cyberghosts-privacy-policy">Close-reading CyberGhost&#39;s privacy policy</h2>
<p>CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It&#39;s not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That&#39;s a great start, but to be certain about a company&#39;s approach to privacy, it&#39;s best to look at its own words.</p>
<p>A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don&#39;t go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption.</p>
<p>When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it&#39;s not in their interest to lie outright in the document.</p>
<p>I went over CyberGhost&#39;s privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=here&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5cG9saWN5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM0ZTQ3MC0wZDQ3LTRmNzktYmE4NC00YzRjMDlhOTg3ZTciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tL3ByaXZhY3lwb2xpY3kifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASYbXwLN1vzWv2OcswQUEfLaywO4SqmgX5b_74w4QCmU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fprivacypolicy" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacypolicy">here</a> if you&#39;d like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of &quot;uncompromising protection&quot;: CyberGhost swears that &quot;<strong>we are NOT storing</strong> connection logs, meaning that <strong>we DON&#39;T have</strong> any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration&quot; (all emphasis theirs).</p>
<p>That&#39;s the standard I&#39;ll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let&#39;s see how it holds up.</p>

<p>The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN.</p>
<p>Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are &quot;fraud detection/prevention&quot; and &quot;To enforce the terms of service,&quot; but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government.</p>
<p>The only potential problem comes in the section titled &quot;Sharing Your Personal Data.&quot; Here, CyberGhost states that &quot;we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,&quot; meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won&#39;t rehash the case against Kape in full — my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">ExpressVPN review</a> covers it in detail.</p>
<p>Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn&#39;t a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn&#39;t own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia.</p>
<p>Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won&#39;t share information with any entity not &quot;located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.&quot; Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn&#39;t have. It&#39;s not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn&#39;t a problem; it&#39;s just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it&#39;s located.</p>
<p>To sum up, I didn&#39;t see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I&#39;m confident that using this VPN doesn&#39;t risk your personal privacy.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-independent-corroboration">Independent corroboration</h3>
<p>CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=again+in+2024&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5aHViL3ByaXZhY3ktYXVkaXQtMjAyNC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5YzRlNDcwLTBkNDctNGY3OS1iYTg0LTRjNGMwOWE5ODdlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeWh1Yi9wcml2YWN5LWF1ZGl0LTIwMjQvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQqglCsIonIccFpaZHW6KnhW7P-QW7kU2nCRfgJGNXoY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fprivacyhub%2Fprivacy-audit-2024%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacyhub/privacy-audit-2024/">again in 2024</a>. Following that pattern, I&#39;ll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it&#39;s only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost&#39;s systems that conflicted with its privacy policy.</p>
<p>The audit notes CyberGhost&#39;s server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn&#39;t see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers.</p>
<p>CyberGhost also posts a regular <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=transparency+report&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS90cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktcmVwb3J0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM0ZTQ3MC0wZDQ3LTRmNzktYmE4NC00YzRjMDlhOTg3ZTciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tL3RyYW5zcGFyZW5jeS1yZXBvcnQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbIOdcmaiBYXn6RqiuhzeQMEbgLLJjp-Y4S6KeT9EbvV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Ftransparency-report" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/transparency-report">transparency report</a> that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information.

<h2 id="jump-link-can-cyberghost-change-your-virtual-location">Can CyberGhost change your virtual location?</h2>
<p>For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">virtual location changes</a> are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn&#39;t happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem.</p>
<p>Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-investigating-cyberghosts-server-network">Investigating CyberGhost&#39;s server network</h2>
<p>CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost&#39;s VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That&#39;s good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are.</p>

<p>Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you&#39;re likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There&#39;s a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia.</p>

</figure>
<p>The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you&#39;re using CyberGhost in Argentina, don&#39;t expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it&#39;s actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost&#39;s support center does include <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/214495965-CyberGhost-VPN-s-Virtual-Server-Locations" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">a list</a> of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it&#39;s not up to date.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-extra-features-of-cyberghost">Extra features of CyberGhost</h2>
<p>CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">NordVPN</a>, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost&#39;s offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn&#39;t matter as much if the features work well. Let&#39;s see how they do.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-kill-switch">Kill switch</h3>
<p>CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it&#39;s fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired.</p>
<p>Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it&#39;s still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It&#39;s an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user&#39;s control.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3>
<p>Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds.</p>
<p>CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It&#39;s limited, but works as advertised.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-optimized-servers">Optimized servers</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: &quot;For gaming,&quot; &quot;For torrenting,&quot; &quot;For streaming&quot; and &quot;NoSpy.&quot; Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn&#39;t see much difference between them and the normal servers.</p>
<p>&quot;For torrenting&quot; is called &quot;For downloading&quot; on Mac, but it&#39;s all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great.</p>

 </div>
</figure>
<p>Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it&#39;s important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming.</p>
<p>Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost&#39;s own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who&#39;s running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That&#39;s relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn&#39;t insist on high standards from collaborators.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-content-blocker">Content blocker</h3>
<p>CyberGhost&#39;s content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There&#39;s no customization like you get with Windscribe&#39;s R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it&#39;s getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn&#39;t test it in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-smart-rules">Smart Rules</h3>
<p>The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost&#39;s features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost&#39;s behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs.</p>
<figure>

 <figcaption>

 </div>
</figure>
<p>Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It&#39;s at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-customer-support-options">CyberGhost customer support options</h2>
<p>CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://support.cyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">support.cyberghostvpn.com</a> or by going through the app. If you choose the options &quot;CyberGhost VPN help&quot; or &quot;FAQ&quot; in the app settings, you&#39;ll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page.</p>
<p>The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I&#39;m having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for &quot;connection issues macos&quot; turned up 72 results, including one called &quot;Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS&quot; and another titled &quot;Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.&quot; These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn&#39;t been checked since.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-live-support-experience">Live support experience</h3>
<p>If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://cyberghostvpnsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">a Zendesk portal</a>. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply.</p>
<p>Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://cyberghost.com" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghost.com</a> by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a &quot;CyberGhost AI Assistant&quot; (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don&#39;t — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn&#39;t working for them.</p>

<p>I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn&#39;t.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-background-check">CyberGhost background check</h2>
<p>CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it&#39;s still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can&#39;t find much information about its history — it doesn&#39;t even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn&#39;t court controversy. Still, I&#39;m naturally paranoid, so I&#39;d understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN.</p>
<p>There is precisely one date in CyberGhost&#39;s history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn&#39;t measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a &quot;malware distributor&quot;; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector.</p>
<p>Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn&#39;t make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not here to defend Kape — I&#39;m just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn&#39;t backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape&#39;s consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">Private Internet Access</a>, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It&#39;s up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost&#39;s parent company presents a hard line you won&#39;t cross.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2>
<p>At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I&#39;m definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it&#39;s not pushing any envelopes, but it&#39;s cheap and it does the job.</p>
<p>All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It&#39;ll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss]]></description>

Anthropic launched Cowork as an exclusive feature for its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Max subscribers</a>, who pay a minimum of $100 per month for more uses of Claude&#39;s expensive reasoning models and early access to experimental features. Now Claude Cowork is available at a cheaper price, though Anthropic notes &quot;Pro users may hit their usage limits earlier&quot; than Max users do.</p><p>Like other AI agents, the novelty of Claude Cowork is its ability to work on its own. If you have the macOS Claude app and a Pro subscription, you can prompt Claude Cowork to work on tasks on your local computer, like creating documents based on files you have saved or organizing your folders. The feature is an evolution of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Claude Code</a>, Anthropic&#39;s AI coding agent, and can similarly use connectors and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Claude Chrome plugin</a> to work with other apps and the web.</p><p>As part of this expanded rollout, Anthropic has included a few fixes inspired by early user feedback. You&#39;ll now be able to rename sessions with Claude Cowork (&quot;Tasks&quot; in the parlance of the Claude app) and the company says the AI assistant will offer better file format previews, more reliable use of connectors to other apps and confirmation messages before it deletes files.</p><p>Coding agents top the list of applications of AI that have gained real traction in the last year, so Anthropic applying what it learned with Claude Code to a more general collection of computer tasks makes sense. Claude Cowork is still limited to macOS and Anthropic&#39;s paid subscribers, but assuming the AI agent continues to be popular, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if the company brought it to other platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-opens-up-its-claude-cowork-feature-to-anyone-with-a-20-subscription-194000021.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you follow Anthropic, you&#39;re probably familiar with Claude Code. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-is-letting-claude-ai-control-your-pc-181500127.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Since the fall of 2024</a>, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/blog/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRfApB7i3w$" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Claude Cowork</a>.</p><p>The company is billing Cowork as &quot;a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.&quot; After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. </p><p>Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that&#39;s easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" data-i13n="slk:Claude in Chrome;cpos:3;pos:1">Claude’s Chrome plugin</a> — and make can use Anthropic&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://claude.com/connectors" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Connectors framework</a> to access third-party apps like Canva. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&quot; However, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">does note</a> the system can &quot;take potentially destructive actions,&quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it&#39;s best to give &quot;very clear&quot; guidance to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">seemingly limited adoption</a>. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   </p><p>Anthropic briefly made Cowork preview only available to users of its pricey <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Claude Max</a> subscription. That changed on Friday when the company expanded access to include customers of its $20 per month Pro plan.  If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you&#39;ll need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. </p><p><strong>Update 01/16/26 2:30PM ET</strong>: Updated to reflect Claude Cowork is now also available to Claude Pro customers. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-launches-claude-cowork-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000849.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside of ChatGPT &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot; In a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post published Friday</a>, the company said adult users in the US of its free and Go tiers (more on the latter in a moment) would start seeing sponsored products and services appear below their conversations with its chatbot. &quot;Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer,&quot; OpenAI said, adding any sponsored spots would not influence the answers ChatGPT generates. &quot;Answers are optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI says people won&#39;t see ads appear when they&#39;re talking to ChatGPT about sensitive subjects like their health, mental state of mind or current politics. The company also won&#39;t show ads to teens under the age of 18. As for privacy, OpenAI states it won&#39;t share or sell your data with advertisers. The company will also give users the option to disable ad personalization and clear the data it uses to generate sponsored responses. &quot;We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,&quot; OpenAI adds. Users can dismiss ads, at which point they&#39;ll be asked to explain why they didn&#39;t engage with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/chatgpt-ads-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/chatgpt-ads-2.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about sponsored content.

Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,&quot; OpenAI said. However, the company was also quick to note its &quot;long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for.&quot;</p><p>To that point, OpenAI said it would also make its ChatGPT Go subscription <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">available to users in the US</a>. The company first launched the tier in India last August, marketing it as a low-cost alternative to its more expensive Plus and Pro offerings. In the US, Go will cost $8 per month — or $12 less than the monthly price of the Plus plan — and offer 10 times higher rate limits for messages, file uploads and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-image-generation-is-now-faster-and-better-at-following-tweaks-180000750.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">image creation</a> than the free tier. The subscription also extends ChatGPT&#39;s memory and context window, meaning the chatbot will be better at remembering details from past conversations. That said, you&#39;ll see ads at this tier.

There’s one where they undressed me and bent me over, and in the background is my child’s backpack that he’s wearing right now,” she said.</p><p>“I am also seeing images where they add bruises to women, beat them up, tie them up, mutilated,” St. Clair told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/05/elon-musk-ashley-st-clair-grok-fake-sexualised-images" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. “These sickos used to have to go to the dark depths of the internet, and now it is on a mainstream social media app.”</p><p>St. Clair said that, after she reported the images to X, the social platform replied that the content didn’t violate any policies. In addition, she claims that X left the images posted for up to seven days after she reported them. St. Clair said xAI then retaliated against her by creating more digitally undressed deepfakes of her, therefore “making [St. Clair] the laughingstock of the social media platform.”</p><p>She accused the company of then revoking her X Premium subscription, verification checkmark and ability to monetize content on the platform. “xAI further banned [her] from repurchasing Premium,” St. Clair’s court filing states.</p><p>On Wednesday, X said it changed its policies so that Grok would no longer generate sexualized images of children or nonconsensual nudity “in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal.” However, the standalone Grok app reportedly continues to undress and sexualize photos when prompted to do so.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-09/8424f5a0-4f40-11ee-acbb-bab134a1b1db" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-09/8424f5a0-4f40-11ee-acbb-bab134a1b1db" style="height:3402px;width:5103px;" alt="WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 23: Google CEO Sundar Pichai (L) and Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) listen as U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable with American and Indian business leaders in the East Room of the White House on June 23, 2023 in Washington, DC.

You are supposed to feed AI humanity and thoughts, and when you are doing things that particularly impact women, and they don’t want to participate in it because they are being targeted, it means the AI is inherently going to be biased.”</p><p>Speaking about Musk and his team, she added that “these people believe they are above the law, because they are.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Last week at CES, Lego <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">introduced its new Smart Play system</a>, with a tech-packed Smart Brick that can recognize and interact with sets and minifigures. It was unexpected and delightful to see Lego come up with a way to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-is-trying-to-make-tech-invisible-with-smart-play-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">modernize its bricks</a> without the need for apps, screens or AI.&nbsp;</p><p>So I was a little surprised this week when the Lego Education group <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=55b2488e-c460-4d49-99ec-60dfa20ede3f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=announced&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9hYm91dHVzL25ld3MvMjAyNi9qYW51YXJ5L2xlZ28tZWR1Y2F0aW9uLWNzLWFpIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NWIyNDg4ZS1jNDYwLTRkNDktOTllYy02MGRmYTIwZWRlM2YiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL2Fib3V0dXMvbmV3cy8yMDI2L2phbnVhcnkvbGVnby1lZHVjYXRpb24tY3MtYWkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYdEE5V4t61RjVVhKdLrAzFg9QCmcTCAZ8UncrC-OrdJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2026%2Fjanuary%2Flego-education-cs-ai" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/january/lego-education-cs-ai">announced</a> its latest initiative is the Computer Science and AI Learning Solution. After all, generative AI feels like the antithesis of Lego’s creative values. But Andrew Silwinski, Lego Education’s head of product experience, was quick to defend Lego’s approach, noting that being fluent in the tools behind AI is not about generating sloppy images or music and more about expanding what it means by teaching computer science.</p><p>“I think most people should probably know that we started working on this before ChatGPT [got big],” Silwinski told Engadget earlier this week. “Some of the ideas that underline AI are really powerful foundational ideas, regardless of the current frontier model that&#39;s out this week. Helping children understand probability and statistics, data quality, algorithmic bias, sensors, machine perception. These are really foundational core ideas that go back to the 1970s.”&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, Lego Education designed courses for grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8 that incorporate Lego bricks, additional hardware and lessons tailored to introducing the fundamentals of AI as an extension of existing computer science education. The kits are designed for four students to work together, with teacher oversight. Much of this all comes from learnings Lego found <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/resources/cs-ai-education-insights/#global-report" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">in a study it commissioned</a> showing that teachers often find they don’t have the right resources to teach these subjects. The study showed that half of teachers globally say “current resources leave students bored” while nearly half say “computer science isn’t relatable and doesn’t connect to students’ interests or day to day.” Given kids’ familiarity with Lego and the multiple decades of experience Lego Education has in putting courses like this together, it seems like a logical step to push in this direction.&nbsp;</p><p>In Lego’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/lego-education-computer-science-and-ai/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">materials about the new courses</a>, AI is far from the only subject covered. Coding, looping code, triggering events and sequences, if/then conditionals and more are all on display through the combination of Lego-built models and other hardware to motorize it. It feels more like a computer science course that also introduces concepts of AI rather than something with an end goal of having kids build a chatbot.</p><p>In fact, Lego set up a number of “red lines” in terms of how it would introduce AI. “No data can ever go across the internet to us or any other third party,” Silwinski said. “And that&#39;s a really hard bar if you know anything about AI.” So instead of going to the cloud, everything had to be able to do local inference on, as Silwinski said, “the 10-year-old Chromebooks you’ll see in classrooms.” He added that “kids can train their own machine learning models, and all of that is happening locally in the classroom, and none of that data ever leaves the student&#39;s device.”</p><p>Lego also says that its lessons never anthropomorphize AI, one of the things that is so common in consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and many more. “One of the things we&#39;re seeing a lot of with generative AI tools is children have a tendency to see them as somehow human or almost magical. A lot of it&#39;s because of the conversational interface, it abstracts all the mechanics away from the child.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lego also recognized that it had to build a course that’ll work regardless of a teacher’s fluency in such subjects. So a big part of developing the course was making sure that teachers had the tools they needed to be on top of whatever lessons they’re working on. “When we design and we test the products, we&#39;re not the ones testing in the classroom,” Silwinski said. “We give it to a teacher and we provide all of the lesson materials, all of the training, all of the notes, all the presentation materials, everything that they need to be able to teach the lesson.” Lego also took into account the fact that some schools might introduce its students to these things starting in Kindergarten, whereas others might skip to the grade 3-5 or 6-8 sets. To alleviate any bumps in the courses for students or teachers, Lego Education works with school districts and individual schools to make sure there’s an on-ramp for those starting from different places in their fluency.</p><p>While the idea of “teaching AI” seemed out of character for Lego initially, the approach it’s taking here actually reminds me a bit of Smart Play. With Smart Play, the technology is essentially invisible — kids can just open up a set, start building, and get all the benefits of the new system without having to hook up to an app or a screen. In the same vein, Silwinski said that a lot of the work you can do with the Computer Science and AI kit doesn’t need a screen, particularly the lessons designed for younger kids. And the sets themselves have a mode that acts similar to a mesh, where you connect numerous motors and sensors together to build “incredibly complex interactions and behaviors” without even needing a computer.</p><p>For educators interested in checking out this latest course, Lego has single kits up for pre-order starting at $339.95; they’ll start shipping in April. That’s the pricing for the K-2 sets, the 3-5 and 6-8 sets are $429.95 and $529.95, respectively. A single kit covers four students. Lego is also selling bundles with six kits, and school districts can also request a quote for bigger orders.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/legos-latest-educational-kit-seeks-to-teach-ai-as-part-of-computer-science-not-to-build-a-chatbot-184636741.html?src=rss]]></description>
