These are free upgrades, with search getting a major AI boost.</p>
<p>First of all, the pre-existing voice search feature is getting &quot;AI smarts.&quot; This means that users will be able to ask contextual questions about movies, actors and shows. It&#39;s worth noting that the bot will deliver the answers on-screen and not via a digital voice. This can be used to help find something to watch, as Roku gives examples of people asking how scary a movie is or if something is safe for children to watch.</p>

<p>A search bar is being added to the live TV page and it will scour all of the platform&#39;s free live channels to find a match. The search tool will also now give more accurate information as to which streaming platform to choose based on active subscriptions and what people are looking for.</p>
<p>The dedicated Roku Sports page will be able to track live scores and will let viewers keep tabs on multiple games at once, thanks to matchup tiles. This can be shut off to keep things spoiler-free.</p>

<p>The company&#39;s pre-existing Bluetooth Headphone Mode is rolling out to more devices, including the Roku Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus. This lets people connect headphones directly without having to use the dedicated app. Both of those made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">best streaming devices</a>, so more functionality is always appreciated.</p>

<p>The app is getting an overhaul, with new shortcuts and the ability to rate shows and movies directly within the app. The company has also revealed that Philips Ambilight technology is now available on Roku TVs in the US. This tech <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-01-philips-android-tv-first-oled-ambilight.html">automatically changes the ambient lighting</a> based on what&#39;s being shown on-screen. All of these software updates will be available to Roku devices in the coming months.</p>
<p>The company also recently refreshed many of its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/roku-adds-more-premium-features-to-its-own-line-of-midrange-tvs-130013368.html">midrange TVs with pro-level features</a>.

For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.<br><br>On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood.<br><br>I built this list of the best VPNs <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html">after intensive testing</a> to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money.

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cyberghost"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVrQQno7FjU_L_63b0vHDybb9MyU3JYewGa0ZnB9nBNf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/">CyberGhost</a></h3> 
<p>There's a lot to recommend with CyberGhost. Its streaming-optimized servers meet a high standard for playback quality, it's pretty fast overall and its Smart Rules offer some of the deepest VPN automation on the market. The ad blocker works well, and the NoSpy servers are a neat idea — CyberGhost keeps them under lock and key near its Romania headquarters and carefully fine-tunes all their settings.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, its apps just aren't up to the standard set by our favorites on this list. I like the designs on paper, but there are too many snags in the experience, from laggy connections to an overactive kill switch that often blocks internet access even when the VPN is working perfectly.</p> 
<p>I also have some concerns about its commitment to data privacy, since its privacy policy retains the right to share your personal data with its entire corporate family. CyberGhost's parent company, Kape Technologies, also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, but neither of those VPNs have privacy policies quite so permissive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla's speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vpn-faqs">VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. There are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, so always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google's One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">For as long as I can remember, I&#39;ve had trouble going to sleep. When I lay down, my mind inevitably starts racing a thousand miles an hour, thinking about anything and everything.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">On several recent nights, though, my pre-slumber thoughts had a singular focus. I mulled over possibilities like, &quot;What if I fuse a ball that heals my character with one that splits into smaller balls with the same effect, and add a passive that fires a baby ball every time I&#39;m healed?&quot; Then I grab my PlayStation Portal and do just that until I doze off. This is the hold </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-spellbinding-ball-x-pit-will-hit-pc-and-consoles-on-october-15-141156022.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em>Ball x Pit</em></span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em> </em>has had over me.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Kenny Sun and a small group of collaborators have cooked up a mesmerizing brick-breaking roguelite. <em>Ball x Pit </em>is a blend of dual-stick shoot-&#39;em-up action, base building and about a dozen other things that keeps calling me back for one more run... and another, and another.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">After a cataclysmic event wipes out the city of Ballbylon and leaves an enormous pit, hunters descend into the depths in search of treasure. For our purposes, this means playing levels to collect resources in order to build structures in New Ballbylon. These buildings unlock perks, such as new characters, that help with future runs. The sickly chaos of the levels and the calmer city building aspect feed into each other smartly and combine for a satisfying loop.</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/ball_x_pit_base.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/ball_x_pit_base.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Base building in Ball x Pit" data-uuid="07a3a623-7bc0-4516-93fa-870f78d2624d"><figcaption>Base building in Ball x Pit</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kenny Sun/Devolver Digital</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">That’s not the only important interplay here. Like any good roguelite, <em>Ball x Pit</em> is all about finding synergies for maximum impact. It&#39;s right there in the title, with the &quot;x&quot; denoting a relationship between two things (it&#39;s derived from shipping in fandom parlance).&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In the pit, you battle monsters by — surprise! — firing balls at them. Along with regular “baby balls,” each character has a unique ability and a special starter ball. In the vein of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, you&#39;ll unlock more special balls and passive abilities when you collect enough gems to level up. One ball has a chance to freeze enemies and another is slower but deals much more damage.&nbsp;There are dozens of others.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The real fun comes in when you start fusing these balls and their effects together, freeing up space for another weapon. It gets even better when you&#39;re able to evolve a pair of balls into something new. It&#39;s possible to fuse evolved balls, or even evolve them again. There’s a strategic aspect to this, as you won’t want to fuse balls that can nearly cancel each other out, such as merging an area-of-effect ball with one that disappears on impact, or leave yourself with too few balls in the face of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Once I unlocked the option to take two characters on a run and combine their passive abilities, that&#39;s where things went into overdrive. The possibilities became very exciting at this point, and I ended up playing <em>Ball x Pit </em>way past my ideal bedtime as a result.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It does take a while to get to that point, though. Progression is slow at first. The repetition can get to be a little much as you need to beat each stage multiple times before moving onto the next. Also, I wish there was a bit more to the game narratively than a basic setup and some character descriptions. </span></p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18pHUtXzF2w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But there&#39;s so much to consider on each run, and that’s what keeps me coming back. Each of the nine levels is set in a different biome, with its own hazards, enemies and bosses. Some late-game characters turn the game on its head by shifting playstyles in surprising ways, but I don&#39;t want to spoil those. Along with the absolute chaos and dopamine hits of slicing through enemies, discovering killer combinations between characters, special balls — especially the evolutions — and passives drives so much of the joy of this game.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Whenever you do fuse or evolve a pair of balls, rather than having to click an &quot;OK&quot; button to get back in the action, the prompt reads &quot;Whoa.&quot; That&#39;s on the nose, but funny. And I&#39;ll be damned if I didn&#39;t say that very thing out loud many times when I saw what a new evolved ball could do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em>Ball x Pit</em> is out now on </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Steam</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch for $15. It&#39;s available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is coming later this fall with a free upgrade from the Switch version.</span></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Proton VPN currently tops my <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">list of the best VPNs</a>, and I gave it a glowing recommendation in my <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">detailed Proton VPN review</a>. It&#39;s easy to use, fast, cheap and secure, with a large server network and one of the industry&#39;s best scores at unblocking streaming sites. All that said, there&#39;s no such thing as a perfect VPN, and you may find that Proton isn&#39;t working for you. If that happens, here&#39;s how to cancel your subscription.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-through-a-browser"><strong>How to cancel Proton VPN through a browser</strong></h2>
<p>If you initially signed up less than 30 days ago, you can cancel your subscription and request a refund by contacting tech support. See &quot;How to get a refund from Proton VPN&quot; below for details. If more than 30 days have passed, use the following steps to cancel your subscription.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ol>
<li><p>Open your browser and go to protonvpn.com. At the top-right, click <strong>Sign in</strong>, then enter your username and password. You&#39;ll be taken to your account dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p>At the left side of the dashboard, click the <strong>Subscription </strong>tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll all the way down to the section labeled <strong>Cancel subscription.</strong> Click the &quot;Continue&quot; button.</p></li>
<li><p>A pop-up window will appear, asking if you&#39;re sure. Click <strong>Cancel subscription</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Cancelling this way doesn&#39;t immediately terminate service — it just means your subscription won&#39;t auto-renew. You can still use Proton VPN&#39;s paid features, including the entire server network, until the current period expires. After that, you&#39;ll be automatically downgraded to the free plan. During this time, your account dashboard will still be active, so you can use it to turn renewal back on if you change your mind.</p>
<p>This method also works in mobile browser apps. Just follow the same steps on your mobile device and you&#39;ll cancel in the same way, with service continuing until your subscription expires.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-downgrade-from-proton-unlimited-to-proton-vpn-only"><strong>How to downgrade from Proton Unlimited to Proton VPN only</strong></h3>
<p>A Proton Unlimited subscription applies to all Proton products. Since it&#39;s mainly founded on Proton Mail, though, downgrading to VPN service only is tricky and requires some extra steps.</p>
<p>First, downgrade Proton Unlimited to Proton Free from your main account dashboard. Log in at account.proton.me, then click <strong>Settings, All settings, Dashboard </strong>and <strong>Your plan. </strong>Under &quot;Proton Unlimited,&quot; click <strong>Explore other Proton plans</strong>. On the next page, select Proton Free. This will effectively cancel Proton Unlimited, though you can still use it until the end of the pay period.</p>
<p>Finally, go to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0e45e071-a672-4eab-abb1-4a96fb0af334&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZTQ1ZTA3MS1hNjcyLTRlYWItYWJiMS00YTk2ZmIwYWYzMzQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcHJvdG9udnBuLmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYSKgjBTMSD66Zr_183t-aNqyh-pcRh0u8xRXg8rdyTR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/">Proton VPN website</a> (not the overall Proton site) and sign up for a Proton VPN Plus plan. Since you downgraded instead of deleting your account, you should be able to use the same account address.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-delete-your-proton-account-on-mobile"><strong>How to delete your Proton account on mobile</strong></h2>
<p>You can also use the mobile app to delete your entire Proton account, instantly and irreversibly ending your subscriptions to Proton VPN, Proton Mail and any other products in the line. Taking this action permanently burns your Proton username, so you won&#39;t be able to use it again if you decide to re-subscribe (in that case, you’ll just have to make a new one).</p>
<p>The process is the same on both Android and iOS — the apps have slight cosmetic differences, but everything is in the same place. Follow the steps below to nuke your Proton account from orbit.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the Proton VPN app on your Android phone.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Settings </strong>at the bottom of the window.</p></li>
<li><p>At the top of the settings page, click your account email address. This will take you to <strong>Account settings</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Delete account. </strong>A window will open in your web browser, showing your general Proton account page.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down to the bottom of this page and click the red <strong>Delete your account </strong>button.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a reason for deleting your account and leave feedback in the box provided. You have to pick an option from the menu and type at least 10 characters in the box, though feel free to keyboard mash if you don&#39;t want to say anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the box on the next page beside &quot;Yes, I want to permanently delete this account and all its data.&quot; Finally, click the red <strong>Delete account</strong> button.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-proton-vpn"><strong>How to get a refund from Proton VPN</strong></h2>
<p>Proton VPN has a 30-day refund policy. As long as you paid for your VPN less than 30 days ago, you can get your money back. To request a refund, send a message through the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0e45e071-a672-4eab-abb1-4a96fb0af334&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=contact+form&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vc3VwcG9ydC9jb250YWN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZTQ1ZTA3MS1hNjcyLTRlYWItYWJiMS00YTk2ZmIwYWYzMzQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcHJvdG9udnBuLmNvbS9zdXBwb3J0L2NvbnRhY3QifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfjD8i-_3lBjVFsp_0S0Nre7KHYXjXJLfztqsDph31OD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fsupport%2Fcontact" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/support/contact">contact form</a> on the website. You can also email protonvpn@support.zendesk.com.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a minimum of 100 characters in the &quot;What happened?&quot; box. Unlike when you&#39;re simply deleting your account, I do recommend putting a brief real answer here, clearly stating that you would like to cancel your account and receive a refund.</p>

<p>According to its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0e45e071-a672-4eab-abb1-4a96fb0af334&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=terms+of+service&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9sZWdhbC90ZXJtcz9yZWY9cHZwbmNvbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGU0NWUwNzEtYTY3Mi00ZWFiLWFiYjEtNGE5NmZiMGFmMzM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9sZWdhbC90ZXJtcz9yZWY9cHZwbmNvbSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWW6BBvys_eg0JKN8E953c0XeDKQQz7cStBk0E0MUjVq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fproton.me%2Flegal%2Fterms%3Fref%3Dpvpncom" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://proton.me/legal/terms?ref=pvpncom">terms of service</a>, Proton will only refund you for the portion of the service you didn&#39;t use. If you spend $10 for a one-month subscription and cancel after 15 days, you&#39;ll get $5 back. The terms do state that the company &quot;may also provide you with a full refund upon request&quot; — directly asking for such a refund in your contact form makes this more likely.</p>
<p>If you cancel after 30 days are up, you may still be able to get a prorated payment for your remaining time, either in cash or account credit. You&#39;ll have to ask for this specifically, as the default option is that your account just stays active until it runs out.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-to-do-if-you-subscribed-through-an-app-store"><strong>What to do if you subscribed through an app store</strong></h3>
<p>If you bought your Proton VPN subscription through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, then Apple or Google processed your money and you&#39;re subject to their refund policies.</p>
<p>If you subscribed through Apple, go to your Apple ID profile in iOS settings, click on <strong>Subscriptions</strong>, scroll to Proton VPN and click on <strong>Cancel subscription.</strong> You&#39;ll then get the opportunity to request a refund.</p>
<p>On Android, log into the Google Play Store, click on your profile picture, then click <strong>Manage subscriptions</strong>. Find Proton VPN, click <strong>Cancel subscription </strong>and provide a reason. As with iOS, the steps will walk you through the refund process.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The VSCO photo editing and sharing app has been around for nearly as long as Instagram, positioning itself as the serious photographer’s choice for mobile editing. The original focus was on tasteful filters and editing tools, all of which got significantly more powerful and flexible over time; VSCO has long been doing the same sort of film emulations that have made Fujifilm’s cameras so desirable in recent years. The company also built up a loyal community of photographers who share their edits far and wide, both in the VSCO app as well as on more mainstream platforms like Instagram itself.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Now, the company is making an unsurprising but potentially controversial move: it is releasing </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://vsco.co/vsco/journal/introducing-ai-lab" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">its first AI-powered image editing tool</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">. “Remove,” as the name suggests, lets you erase “unwanted elements” from your photos without compromising the image’s full resolution. At first glance, it feels quite similar to tools like Google’s own Magic Eraser. You just pop open an image in the editor and highlight the portion you want to remove, and VSCO will do its best to obliterate the offending bits and fill in whatever is in the background that it deems appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I haven’t had a chance to test how effective this tool is yet, but VSCO is using Black Forest Lab’s </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bfl.ai/models/flux-kontext" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">FLUX.1 Kontext model</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> to do its magic, combined with its own proprietary technology specifically focused on making results that the company says look authentic. A quick look at Black Forest Lab and the FLUX.1 model show a tool that does appear to be well-suited to removing unwanted parts of an image and properly filling in the space that remains —&nbsp;but we’ll have to see it in action to judge whether it does the job well.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">This new Remove tool isn’t the only AI-powered editor VSCO is working on. There’s also an Upscale tool in the works that the company says will “enhance image resolution” while keeping color and composition unchanged. These sorts of tools will live under a new umbrella the company is calling AI Lab, making it clear this will be an ongoing initiative and not just a one-off release.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">On one hand, I’m not at all surprised to see VSCO jumping into AI-powered editing; it has to keep up with the rest of the industry. But on the other hand, the company has made its mark by building a community of photographers who value authenticity in their work, something that cannot help but be in conflict with AI tools, at least on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">VSCO’s CEO Eric Wittman acknowledged that tension in a conversation with Engadget. “We have a very photographer-centric, creator-first point of view,” Wittman said. “But where we see AI fitting in is in <em>support</em> of those folks, and that work, and that vision. The intention isn’t to replace [that work], though — AI has a place, but it’s not to replace what creators, and photographers in particular, are doing.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">That mindset makes sense with something like Remove, which duplicates something people have done with Photoshop for years. Rather than generating new images or radically changing the truth of a photo like you can do with some of Google’s tools on the Pixel phones, Remove is a bit more subtle. “You would use masks, you would manually painstakingly edit things at a pixel by pixel level,” Wittman said. “What a lot of Remove tools would do is basically like automate that.”</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Wittman also cited preserving image quality as a key part of the work behind its own Remove tool. “We know that many people who were attempting to use AI in the early days, especially photographers, a lot of their disappointment was just in the preservation of the integrity and the quality of the work,” he said. “So what we&#39;ve really tried to do is continue to help automate where we can and make things easier, but also preserve the quality.” To that end, VSCO is stressing that all these edits are non-destructive and the output will be in full, original resolution.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">As VSCO starts dabbling in more AI editing tools, Wittman emphasized that the company wants to stay on the side of helping photographers realize a creative vision rather than helping them make entirely unreal images, while also avoiding the mess of copyright issues and inauthentic content that is flooding the internet thanks to AI. “When you think about things like copyright, and the incredible importance of copyright, integrity, and authenticity — we&#39;re big believers as a company in both the laws and the norms that have been around for many many years. But obviously on some platforms there are people who are maliciously manipulating things, and we don&#39;t want to be participants in that.”</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">VSCO’s first AI Labs feature is available as of today in the VSCO app for iOS; it should come to Android eventually but there’s no word yet on specific timing. To use it, you’ll need an active </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.vsco.co/features/vsco-membership" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">VSCO Pro subscription</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, which runs $13 per month or $60 a year. A Pro plans contains a ton more than just AI Labs features, though —&nbsp;it unlocks a full editing suite on mobile and the web, professional profile and website creation, hundreds of presets and film emulation settings and a lot more.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/vsco-adds-its-first-ai-powered-photo-editing-tool-170000055.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>An Apple-made smart display in particular has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-smart-home-devices-report-155130684.html"><ins>featured</ins></a> heavily in the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-rumored-smart-display-may-arrive-in-2025-running-new-homeos-212401853.html"><ins>rumor mill</ins></a> for a number of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-smart-home-hub-could-reportedly-make-its-debut-later-this-year-161702487.html"><ins>years</ins></a>, but it appears to be closer than ever. <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple’s new home hub will have a 7-inch square LCD display, a built-in FaceTime camera and an OS that dynamically adjusts depending on who’s using it. It will also ship with an improved version of Siri that will behave more like ChatGPT or other chatbots in how it uses the web to answer your questions. The product, along with the more advanced Siri chatbot, had been slated for release earlier this year, but Apple reportedly scrapped those plans in favor of a spring 2026 launch.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Bloomberg </em>claims there will be two versions of the home hub, one code-named J940 which takes the form of a display mounted on a HomePod mini-like speaker, and the other (J491) designed to be hung on a wall. With both you’ll be able to control smart appliances, play music and presumably interact with Apple’s various apps on other devices. Apple is said to be targeting a price of around $350, although the <em>Bloomberg </em>report does not specify which version of the device that price refers to.</p>
<p>The tabletop robot scheduled to launch in 2027 will effectively be the smart display Apple could be releasing next year mounted into a motorized arm that can move the device to different positions, which sounds like the company’s take on Amazon’s (slightly creepy) swivelling<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759-130012767.html"><ins> Echo Show 10</ins></a>, first launched in 2021. This product will have a larger 9-inch display, but is said to be delayed after Apple encountered engineering challenges with the motor.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg </em>reports that all three of these devices will be built in Vietnam, which sources said represented a &quot;major change&quot; in how Apple launches a new product category, as it has traditionally relied on China at the outset. In 2020 it <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-may-move-ipad-macbook-production-to-vietnam-160033102.html"><ins>emerged</ins></a> that Apple was looking to diversify its production by moving some of its iPad and MacBook manufacturing to Vietnam, and the US’ trade war with China has only <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-threatens-a-25-percent-tariff-on-all-smartphones-not-made-in-the-us-195122531.html"><ins>intensified</ins></a> during Trump’s second administration.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The new M5 MacBook Pro has arrived — and brought something of a strategy change for Apple's chip release strategy this year. This time around, Apple has led with the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, which retains the same $1,599 starting price as its M4 predecessor. It debuts alongside <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-latest-ipad-pro-get-a-power-boost-with-the-new-m5-chip-131036435.html">new 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros</a> and a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">refreshed Apple Vision Pro</a> that have the same <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-latest-ipad-pro-get-a-power-boost-with-the-new-m5-chip-131036435.html">M5 chipset</a>, but — unlike <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-macbook-pros-get-an-m4-upgrade-including-the-new-m4-max-chip-150055208.html">last year</a> — there's no M5 Pro and M5 Max devices to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the past, Apple has favored launching its entire MacBook Pro lineup at once, as it did in 2024 with the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max models. However, it may have decided to release the M5 model now so it could get a jump start on sales, since the M5 Pro and M5 Max versions are <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-14/apple-pitches-a-return-to-design-roots-six-years-after-jony-ive-exit-2026-plan">reportedly</a> still several months away. Apple may have also opted for a low-key release since the M5 MacBook Pro is largely unchanged from the previous model.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>With that, the emphasis is squarely on the M5 chip and its extra performance. Reportedly <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-14/apple-pitches-a-return-to-design-roots-six-years-after-jony-ive-exit-2026-plan">due to cost reasons</a>, Apple decided to use the same 3-nanometer fabrication process for the M5 as it did for the M4. The new chip has 10 GPU cores and 10 CPU cores, along with a 16-core Neural Engine.</p> 
<p>Apple claims the M5 has the "world’s fastest CPU core" with up to 20 percent faster multithreaded performance compared with the M4 chip. As for the GPU, the company says that offers "up to 1.6x faster graphics performance in pro apps and enables up to 1.6x higher frame rates in games compared to the M4 model." That should make the M5 MacBook Pro a better option than the M4 model for things like gaming and video editing.</p> 
<p>To that end, compared with the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple says the latest model delivers up to 1.8x faster "AI video-enhancing performance" in Topaz Video, up to 1.7x faster 3D rendering in Blender and up to 1.2x faster build performance during code compiling in Xcode. The company is promising 3.5x faster AI performance than with the M4 model, and up to 6x faster performance than M1. It also claims SSD performance is up to twice as fast as the previous generation.</p> 
<p>The M5 MacBook Pro comes with the same 14.2-inch, 3,024 x 1,964 Liquid Retina XDR display that can hit 1,000 nits in SDR mode and up to 1,600 nits peak brightness for HDR content. It has adaptive refresh rates at up to 120Hz and offers a wide P3 color gamut with up to 1 billion colors, ideal for video editors and Lightroom users.</p> 
<p>Other key features include an SDXC card slot, HDMI port and 3.5mm headphone jack. There are three USB-C ports as before, but they're still the Thunderbolt 4 type with speeds up to 40 Gbps, and not the 80 Gbps Thunderbolt 5 ports found on M4 Pro and Max models. It also comes with a six-speaker system with support for Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio as before, along with Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 and a 12MP Center Stage 1080p webcam. As you might imagine, it comes with macOS Tahoe ready to go.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fujifilm just announced the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/mini-liplay-plus/"><ins>Instax mini LiPlay+ instant camera</ins></a>, which is a refresh of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/review/fujifilm-instax-mini-liplay/"><ins>original mini LiPlay from 2019</ins></a>. It&#39;s been six long years, so the company has added some nifty features here.</p>
<p>First of all, there&#39;s a second camera on the rear that&#39;s intended for selfies. It features a wide-angle lens and joins the pre-existing front-facing camera. There&#39;s a new functionality that lets users combine the content from both cameras to create unique layered images. That&#39;s pretty nifty.</p>

<p>The design is mostly the same as before, but the rear LCD is larger. This should make it easier to accurately compose images before printing them out. To that end, there&#39;s a new film type accompanying the launch of this camera. The Soft Glitter instant film is available in ten-exposure packs and offers gold accents and soft hues to &quot;bring a calming shimmer&quot; around the frames. Film packs cost around $18.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a redesigned app with plenty of new features, including the ability to add short audio clips to images. These multimedia creations can be viewed by scanning a QR code in the print, which will trigger the audio on a smartphone or similar device. The LiPlay+ app lets users further edit images before printing them via the camera.</p>
<p>The camera will be available for purchase by the end of the month and costs $235. There will be blue and beige versions. The original mini LiPlay didn&#39;t quite make our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-instant-camera-120034778.html"><ins>best instant cameras</ins></a>, but several Fujifilm Instax models did. The company makes good stuff.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilms-refreshed-instax-mini-liplay-has-an-extra-camera-for-selfies-164319167.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a> is useful in lots of ways every day, whether you're streaming foreign TV shows or keeping yourself anonymous online so advertisers can't track you. But while we strongly recommend using a VPN, it pays to do some research before investing in one — pricing can be opaque for these services, and you can't always trust how the providers portray their best deals. Even so, there are genuinely great deals to be had.</p>
<p>VPN providers love to give out deep discounts to anybody willing to sign up for a year or more at once. This means you've got to pay out more upfront, but if you divide the cost by the months of service, you're actually paying less per month over time. With deals like this, VPN providers boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.</p>

With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.</p>

Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It took two years <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/two-years-later-meta-is-making-dms-on-threads-official-160056258.html">for Threads to get messaging</a>, but you thankfully don&#39;t have to wait that long to be able to start group DMs. Meta has started rolling out group chats for the app, which lets you add up to 50 of your followers to a single conversation. Just start a new message and add anybody who follows you on Threads. The company says that you&#39;ll also be able to share a link that your followers can click to join a group conversation &quot;soon,&quot; so you don&#39;t have to add them one by one. Like in messaging apps, you&#39;ll be able to customize the group chat&#39;s name to better reflect its topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to launching group DMs, Meta is also releasing the messaging feature in the European Union over the coming days. If you&#39;re in the EU, you&#39;ll get access not just to individual DMs, but also to group DMs, messaging controls, privacy settings, the hidden folder where spam goes to and support for media files when the feature becomes available in your country.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Emily Dalton Smith, Meta&#39;s Head of Product for Threads, told us in a test group chat that it&#39;s &quot;on track to become Meta&#39;s next major app&quot; with 400 million monthly active users.&quot; Messaging has been the top requested feature since Threads launched, but it took some time to release it because it &quot;wasn&#39;t a priority in the early days.&quot; Since making DMs available on Threads in July, Meta has added support for photos, videos and GIFs, a messaging requests folder to reduce unwanted messages, the hidden spam folder and a privacy setting that completely switches off message requests from people you don&#39;t follow.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waymo is bringing its autonomous taxis to the UK in 2026, marking the company’s first major expansion outside of the US. Waymo has selected the mobility company, Moove, as its fleet operations partner, and is currently working with local and national authorities in the UK to gain the necessary permissions to launch a robotaxi service in London first next year.</p>
<p>Right now, you won’t find any fully driverless cars in London or anywhere in the UK, but that’s set to change next year when the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-driving-vehicles-set-to-be-on-roads-by-2026-as-automated-vehicles-act-becomes-law"><ins>Automated Vehicles Act 2024</ins></a> begins to take effect. This legislation is intended to regulate the eventual arrival of self-driving vehicles in the UK, but before that can happen, the government will <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/automated-vehicles-act-2024-implementation">help</a> to facilitate robotaxi pilots from Spring 2026.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Given its complex road network and narrow winding streets built long before cars were a concern, London will be a challenging city for Waymo’s robotaxis to navigate, but the company said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://waymo.com/blog/2025/10/hello-london-your-waymo-ride-is-arriving"><ins>statement</ins></a> that its technology significantly reduces the risk of injury-causing collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians compared to human-driven cars. The imminent arrival of Waymo in the UK was also welcomed by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), with self-driving taxis seen as an important first step in ushering in autonomous travel on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Waymo already has close links to the UK, with its first international engineering hubs located in London and Oxford. It also has a partnership with UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, which sees it equip all-electric Jaguar I-Pace taxis with its Waymo Driver self–driving tech in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Waymo won&#39;t be without competition when its service arrives in London next year. Uber and Wayve are <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-uk-will-get-its-first-robotaxis-next-year-131731015.html"><ins>planning</ins></a> for their own pilot to launch around the same time, after the latter’s CEO and co-founder, Alex Kendall, called the arrival of the Automated Vehicles Act &quot;a defining moment for UK autonomy.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-plans-to-launch-fully-autonomous-taxi-service-in-london-next-year-142453250.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has introduced an upgraded version of its Vision Pro headset that&#39;s powered by the company&#39;s M5 chip, its latest silicon that will also come with the new iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">first generation</a> of the headset was equipped with Apple&#39;s M2, so you can expect this device to be faster and come with more capabilities. Apple hasn&#39;t budged the price from $3,499 with 256GB of storage, but at least it comes with a Dual Knit Band, which adds a top strap for extra security and comfort. (Existing Vision Pro users can also buy the Dual Knit Band separately for $99.)</p>
<p>As you&#39;d expect, Apple claims the refreshed Vision Pro should be faster while loading apps, browsing the web and doing just about everything. The M5 chip also includes a new 10-core GPU, with better support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, &quot;enabling developers to add remarkable detail to lighting, shadows, and reflections in games like Control,&quot; according to Apple. The company also says the M5 Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on its micro-OLED displays, which should make everything look a bit sharper.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The M5 Vision Pro should last a bit longer than the original model, as well. Apple claims it supports up to two and a half hours of typical usage, and up to three hours of video playback. The previous model was rated for two hours of general usage and two and a half hours of video viewing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> Mark Gurman <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-first-products-with-apples-m5-chip-could-make-their-debut-this-week-163149688.html">reported</a> a few days ago that Apple was due for another wave of product announcements. He wrote back then that the new iPad Pro and Vision Pro are already being mass produced and that Apple is &quot;gearing up for an imminent release.&quot; Apple had originally wanted to launch a a lighter and cheaper version of the Vision Pro headset, as well, but it reportedly decided to shift its focus on the development of smart glasses. The company pulled people working on the lighter Vision Pro, Gurman said in another <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-is-reportedly-pulling-staff-from-the-vision-pro-to-work-on-its-smart-glasses-130050475.html">report</a>, and moved them to its smart glasses project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple is reportedly working on a smart glasses model with no display and is meant to pair with iPhones, along with another model that&#39;s equipped with a built-in screen and can directly compete with <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html">Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban Display</a>. The company is aiming to release the model with no screen in 2027 and the one with a screen in 2028, Gurman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Vision Pro is a flawed product, but it&#39;s certainly not empty,&quot; we noted in our review of the original headset. &quot;It&#39;s as if Apple has compiled everything it&#39;s learned from building the Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods into a single device, all in a bid to avoid the Innovator&#39;s Dilemma.&quot; At first glance, the M5 Vision Pro doesn&#39;t seem to change that conclusion much, not without more content and apps built around spatial computing. A price drop and more storage on the base model would certainly make the Vision Pro more compelling, until that happens it&#39;ll remain more of a developer kit than a full-fledged consumer product.</p>
<p>The M5 Vision Pro is now ready to pre-order and will once again set you back $3,499. Apple will start shipping the device on October 22.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Last year Apple decided to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">debut its M4 chip</a> with the iPad Pro lineup and not its laptops. The reason? Only the entry-level M4 was ready (and not the M4 Pro and M4 Max), so Apple decided to wait before putting in its MacBooks so it could <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-macbook-pros-get-an-m4-upgrade-including-the-new-m4-max-chip-150055208.html">launch the entire lineup</a> at once. With updated Magic Keyboards, It also showed that Apple was marketing the iPad Pro as a feasible MacBook replacement for power users.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The same applies with the M5, except this time the company also launched its entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro at the same time. As before, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=26ddf7f3-c21d-4e74-921f-aec742c0b627&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=the+new+M5+processor&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8xMC9hcHBsZS11bmxlYXNoZXMtbTUtdGhlLW5leHQtYmlnLWxlYXAtaW4tYWktcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZm9yLWFwcGxlLXNpbGljb24vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNmRkZjdmMy1jMjFkLTRlNzQtOTIxZi1hZWM3NDJjMGI2MjciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzEwL2FwcGxlLXVubGVhc2hlcy1tNS10aGUtbmV4dC1iaWctbGVhcC1pbi1haS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1mb3ItYXBwbGUtc2lsaWNvbi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ9mccLaqcqdQL9XcCth6N0wYeYw1CBumEXhkYG24FX9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F10%2Fapple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/">the new M5 processor</a> uses TSMC's 3-nanometer process, as Apple reportedly decided against 2-nanometer chips due to cost considerations. The entry-level M5 comes in a couple of versions. The iPad Pro with either 256GB or 512GB of storage gets an M5 with a 9-core CPU (3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores), 10-core GPU and 12GB of RAM. The 1TB and 2TB models get a fourth performance core and 16GB of RAM.</p> 
<p>The big upgrade here appears to be to the GPU; Apple says each of the 10 GPU cores have a Neural Accelerator on board, which will allow GPU-based AI processing to run significantly faster than on the M4. Apple claims it has more than four times the peak GPU compute performance of the M4 (which is only about 18 months old, mind you). Graphics performance should be about 45 percent higher than on the M4, as well. Overall multithreaded performance is 15 percent faster than the M4, and Apple says that video transcoding is six times faster than what the old M1 iPad Pro from 2021 delivered.</p> 
<p>As for battery life, Apple claims the same 10 hours that basically every iPad has ever been rated at. But for the first time, the iPad Pro supports fast charging — you can get up to 50 percent in 30 minutes using a 60W USB-C power adaptor.</p> 
<p>Apple is also using the C1X modem that it originally <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-air-is-apples-thinnest-phone-yet-174342422.html">introduced last month</a> in the iPhone Air; that'll provide the optional 5G service that Apple has offered on iPads for a few years now. There's also an N1 chip (also found in the iPhone Air), which is an Apple-designed networking chip for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread connectivity. Apple claims this new chip will make features like Personal Hotspot and Airdrop more reliable while also offering improved performance on 5GHz Wi-Fi networks.</p> 
<p>As before, the 2025 iPad Airs are extremely thin and light. The 11-inch model is 5.3mm thick and tips the scales at just under one pound, while the 13-incher is just 5.1mm thick weighs 1.29 pounds. Both feature "tandem" OLED Ultra Display XDR screens that hit up to 1,000 nits brightness and peak at 1,600 nits — so they're perfect for viewing and editing HDR content.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model with 256GB of storage ($1,199 with 5G) and $1,299 for the 13-inch ($1,499 with 5G). Those are the same prices as last year — still extremely expensive, but at least not more than before. You can pre-order the new iPad Pro now, and it'll be available on October 22.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xbox is at a crossroads. While the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 continue to gain popularity, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/microsoft-just-increased-all-xbox-prices-grab-one-before-the-hikes-go-into-effect-192628921.html">multiple</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html">price hikes</a> for the Xbox Series S and X have killed their momentum. And with several big box retailers like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/costco-reportedly-stops-selling-xbox-consoles-online-184906670.html">Costco</a> deciding to drop Microsoft’s console from their shelves, the current-gen Xbox may be dead in the water. So what should the company do?</p> 
<p>Microsoft’s most straightforward option would be to simply punt the end of the Xbox's lifecycle, regroup and come back strong with a brand new console in a year or two. On the flipside, the company could follow in Sega's footsteps after the untimely demise of the Dreamcast and become a cross-platform game publisher with a large stable of first-party studios. However, there's a third route that could fill the gap between now and whenever the next Xbox arrives that could potentially expand its reach to a whole new segment: Give handheld gaming a go.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Engineering and building a new portable gaming device isn't cheap or quick. So instead of doing everything itself, Microsoft teamed up with ASUS to create the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X — a pair of Windows 11-based portable gaming PCs enhanced with Microsoft's DNA. And while it's too early to say if these handhelds will help save Xbox itself, they're more than solid portables that could have a big impact on portable gaming going forward.</p> 
<p><em>Editor's note: This review is focused on the ROG Xbox Ally X, primarily because that's all we have at the moment. However, the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share many features including the same basic design , display, button layout and software (the only difference is their color). That said, the base Xbox Ally has less impressive specs as it comes with a slower AMD Ryzen Z2 chip, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a smaller 60WHr battery. It’s also a touch lighter (1.48 pounds vs 1.58) and has a lower price of $600 instead of $1,000.</em></p>

<p>When you look at the ROG Xbox Ally X, it might appear as if ASUS bolted larger grips to its previous handheld — <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-ally-review-a-fully-armed-and-operational-handheld-battle-station-133043986.html">the Ally X</a> — and called it a day. However, the company says the Xbox Ally was redesigned from the ground up, in large part to include a number of signature features that will make Xbox faithful feel right at home. This includes things like the classic ABXY button layout, Impulse triggers with tons of travel and, of course, the requisite Xbox home button. Then smack dab in the middle of everything is a 7-inch IPS LCD screen.</p> 
<p>Speaking of the display, ASUS picked a FHD IPS panel with a 120Hz refresh rate that appears to be the exact same screen used on the Ally X. While it doesn't deliver pure blacks like you'd get from OLED, contrast was still surprisingly good. With a brightness of 500 nits (the one on our review unit was actually a touch higher at 510 nits), this display delivers almost everything you want without feeling like you need to upgrade to something like the huge 8.8-inch OLED panel on the Lenovo Legion Go 2.</p>

<p>Around back, there are two customizable paddles while the top edge houses a fingerprint reader and all of the Xbox Ally X's connectivity: two USB-C ports, a microSD card reader and 3.5mm audio. Notably, while both ports support charging and display capabilities, the one furthest to the left is also Thunderbolt 4 compliant. This means it has enough bandwidth to support external GPUs like ASUS' recently updated XG Mobile graphics dock.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, the ROG Xbox Ally might not look all that different from ASUS' previous handhelds, but between its buttons, triggers and those big new grips, it really does feel like you're holding a portable version of Microsoft's console. Even without Hall Effect sensors, the Xbox Ally X's joysticks are tight and responsive, while the triggers offer a ton of travel. The only thing I wish ASUS and Microsoft had paid a little more attention to is the handheld's haptics, which are fine, but they’re a far cry from the expressive rumble motors you get from a DualSense controller or the Switch 2's Joy-Con.</p>

<p>As the higher-end model in ASUS and Microsoft's new joint handheld lineup, the ROG Xbox Ally X features a AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip with 24GB of memory (which is shared with its GPU) and 1TB of storage that can be expanded via microSD. However, thanks in part to the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft tweaked a number of the handheld's background processes and services for the first time on a Windows 11-based handheld. The result is a slightly more optimized device even when compared to its closest rivals.</p> 
<p>In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 1,920 x 1,080, medium graphics and FSR set to performance, the ROG Xbox Ally X hit 62.1 fps while plugged in and set to its max 35-watt Turbo mode. That's almost five fps higher than what we got from the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (57.5 fps) when its settings are similarly maxed out. Admittedly, this might not sound like a huge improvement, but it ends up being an extra seven percent performance from the same chip, which ain't bad. Meanwhile in <em>Returnal, </em>I got similar numbers after switching to the Ally's more energy-efficient 17-watt Performance Mode (unplugged), where it produced 42 fps at full HD on medium versus 39 fps for the Lenovo.</p>

<p>That said, it's important to note that the Ally's performance changes depending on whether it's plugged into the wall or not. If you want its full 35-watt Turbo Mode, you're going to need to use a power adapter, while its 17-watt Performance and 13-watt Silent modes stay the same no matter what you do. There’s also a manual performance customization tool, but to access it, you'll need to switch over to ASUS' Armoury Crate app, as there isn't a place to change things directly inside the Xbox app.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-software-the-tailored-gaming-experience-we-needed">Software: The tailored gaming experience we needed</h2> 
<p>Getting excited about the software on a gaming handheld is usually pretty difficult. However, between the aforementioned tweaks to background services and the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft has managed to remove a ton of the clunkiness that typically plagues other Windows-based gaming handhelds.</p> 
<p>Instead of having to wade your way through the traditional Windows desktop before booting into a game, now you're greeted by the Xbox app upon startup (and even during initial setup), so there are fewer steps to get between you and your favorite title. Furthermore, Microsoft has come up with a revamped layout that makes core features super easy to find. The Home tab is where all your installed software is, while there are other dedicated sections for Game Pass downloads (assuming you have a subscription) cloud gaming/remote play (also via Game Pass) and the Microsoft Store. If you prefer other digital marketplaces like Steam or Epic, there are shortcuts to download installers for those stores (and a few more like GOG and Ubisoft) in the My Apps tab. You don't need to open a web browser and do things manually.</p>

<p>Furthermore, hitting the Xbox button summons a handful of quick settings for all sorts of things, including the Command Center for performance, toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, your Xbox friends list and a whole lot more. It's kind of like a do-everything button and it makes accessing almost all of your most important tools and features quick and easy.</p> 
<p>On top of that, there are new gestures that you can access by swiping in on the screen in different directions. Dragging your finger in from the left calls up the Xbox Game Bar overlay, even when you're in the middle of playing a game, while swiping in from the right opens your Windows notifications. But my favorite command is swiping up from the bottom, which is a new way to switch between apps (or a cooler version of Alt + Tab, depending on how you look at it). From there, you can even scroll through any programs that are currently open just by tapping the Xbox Ally's shoulder buttons. If you want to use the handheld like a real PC, you can also activate the Windows desktop from there too.</p>

   Microsoft has also thoughtfully included compatibility tags on a number of games in its store to give buyers a sense of how well a game will run on the ROG Xbox Ally X.

<p>The redesigned Xbox experience is very breezy and handles 90 to 95 percent of your traditional gaming functions, but there are still times when some of Window's underlying awkwardness shows through. Most often, I found this happens when exiting a game from a third-party store, where the Xbox Ally will spit you out into your Steam library (for example), where you'll often have to rely on touchscreen controls instead of the joysticks or the desktop mode's mouse cursor to navigate around. It's not a big deal compared to other Windows-based handhelds, and even though Microsoft has taken a big step forward on the Xbox Ally, there is still a little polishing to be done.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-life-a-solid-jump-in-longevity">Battery life: A solid jump in longevity</h2> 
<p>One of the biggest benefits of going with the ROG Xbox Ally X is that it comes with a larger 80WHr battery than the base model (60Whr). When that is combined with improved energy efficiency from its new chip, you get very solid battery life — just as long as you don’t max out the power settings.</p>

<p>I tested this by playing <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> at full HD on medium settings and max brightness (Protip: don’t do this at night if you want to get to sleep on time) and the Xbox Ally X lasted just shy of three and a half hours. That’s 30 minutes longer than what I got from the Legion Go 2, although considering the latter has a much larger screen (with the same 500 nits of brightness), that difference wasn’t a big shock. The bigger revelation is that when compared to the original Ally X, ASUS and Microsoft’s new jointly-made device provided an extra hour of runtime, which could make a meaningful difference on a long trip.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements. The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here. Sure, there are still a few edge cases where you’ll have to tap the screen or flip between the Xbox app and ASUS’ Armoury Create to tweak certain settings, but compared to most of its rivals, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a massive upgrade in general usability.</p>

<p>The bigger grips and a familiar button layout will instantly make longtime Xbox fans feel right at home. And thanks to the new chip and more processes and services that run in the background while you’re gaming, you get class-leading performance and battery life.</p> 
<p>Aside from lackluster haptics, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s biggest issue is its price. I totally get that there’s a growing number of gamers who constantly crave better performance from their portable PCs. However, the trade-off for all this is a much bigger hit to your wallet. It wasn’t that long ago when the going rate for a premium handheld was more like $500, which made it easier to afford. After all, those devices weren’t really designed to be your main gaming rig like a laptop or desktop.</p> 
<p>Ultimately the biggest deciding factor for purchasing the ROG Xbox Ally X may be how much someone is already invested into the Xbox ecosystem. If you’re a fan of other game stores or you don’t have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass or a ton of friends on the platform, you won’t get the full benefit of everything Microsoft has integrated into the handheld’s new software. This goes double for devotees of Valve’s digital store and Linux-based OS that don’t need bleeding edge performance, who can safely stick to much more affordable <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">Steam Decks</a> or the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos-review-a-purpose-built-os-makes-all-the-difference-120059561.html">Legion Go S</a>.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, if you want a versatile portable with a giant OLED screen and detachable controllers, the Legion Go 2 is worth consideration as well. Though at $1,300 for the model with a Z2 Extreme chip, it’s even more expensive than this new handheld Xbox. Still, despite some minor caveats, Microsoft has finally put its spin on portable PC gaming (with an assist from ASUS) and brought some welcome upgrades to the space that have made the ROG Xbox Ally X a top shelf device.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html?src=rss]]></description>

Sometimes, it’s about the quality of the hardware, but more often it’s about the philosophy of its makers. Imagine trying to review a toilet built by, and for, aliens from the planet Zog: You can appreciate the intention behind it, but you’ll never be able to praise it. That’s the issue I’ve had with </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/halliday-promises-its-smart-wayfarers-have-a-proactive-ai-assistant-inside-010007688.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Halliday’s smart glasses</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, because almost every design decision made by its creators feels, to me, like the wrong one. Cofounder Carter Hou conceded that some people love Halliday’s approach and others haven’t taken to it anywhere near as much. Sadly, I’ve found myself in the latter category.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Halliday announced itself to the world at CES in January, dragging behind it a truckload of promises about its Wayfarer-style smart glasses. It said the glasses would be “invisible to onlookers,” styled to be as close to a regular pair of specs as it could manage. There’d be no outward facing camera or sensors, just a tiny interior display projecting data into the wearer’s view. It talked up its “proactive” AI assistant that was always listening and would pipe up with an answer when asked a question. It would be discreetly controlled with a touchpad ring, so you’d not need to visibly fiddle with your phone or the glasses’ touch-sensitive arm to use it. Plus, it would weigh just 35 grams. What’s not to like?&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The company launched a Kickstarter at the end of January, earning $3,305,917 from more than 8,000 backers. The company has already shared its first product with backers, and it’s now ready to share it with retail customers. I’ve been testing the hardware for around a month with regular software updates. Halliday assured me that the last few issues, like inconsistent Bluetooth connectivity, should be ironed out by the time it’s available to the masses.</span></p> 
<p> <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="ce1817fd-ce58-4f06-a293-4971df07b58e" data-original-url="https://hallidayglobal.com/products/halliday-glasses"></core-commerce></p> 
<h2 style="text-align:left;" id="e1a6586d-e2a1-4a2a-bd5f-05abba3380bd"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Hardware&nbsp;</span></h2> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Halliday’s chunky Wayfarer-style glasses are made out of plastic, with thin plastic lenses set to your prescription. Plastic is obviously easy to work with and affordable, but it also can give the appearance and feel of looking a bit cheap and flimsy. Even the temple tips are made of solid plastic, which means they can’t be adjusted to suit your head shape and comfort levels.The only way to modify how they sit on your face is by contorting the nose pads, which you’ll be told to do during setup.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">On the underside of the right temple tip, you’ll find a rubber gasket covering its built-in USB-C charging port. Follow it towards the front and you’ll find one of two speakers (its twin sits on the opposite arm), the touch surface for control and the power button. Sitting over the right lens is a little plastic cantilever arm, on the end of which is a 3.6mm round microLED display module. The arm can be pulled in or out and tilted up and down to put the display into your peripheral vision.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The aim, as stated, was to make a small and light pair of glasses that wouldn’t draw attention to themselves. Sadly, Halliday couldn’t avoid the issue that plagues all smart glasses, which is that they have to be bigger to accommodate all the electronics. But, to my eye, they only <em>just about</em> register as a bold style choice rather than as a comically-oversized pair of specs.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The control ring is available in US sizes 8-15, and is made of silver plastic with a small clickpad section embedded. Continuing Halliday’s focus on subtlety, the ring’s only distinguishing mark is a small black line on one side of the clickpad to indicate the right hand side. Slide the ring on without remembering to check its orientation and you’ll be trying to use the menus upside down and back to front. Like a lot of smart rings, it’ll certainly stand out on your hand if you’re used to thinner, daintier adornments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It’s easy enough to put a teeny-tiny display close to your eye, ostensibly tricking it into thinking it's much larger. The 3.6mm microLED module is meant to project the equivalent of a 3.5-inch display into your field of view. It’s the same sort of barebones green monochrome display found in a lot of wearables since green is easy to read and not too power-hungry. Again, the focus on invisibility means you’re meant to flick your eyes toward it, read what you need and flick back before anyone’s really noticed.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">There are many reasons why this is a smart choice compared to companies using waveguide prisms embedded in the lenses itself. It saves a lot of weight, makes what you’re looking at far more private and cuts down the cost. Since, after all, you can just use cheap regular or prescription lenses in the frame, rather than specialist ones with the built-in prisms.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But the use of a tiny-display-close-to-your-eye is a problem if you are already a glasses wearer. After all, the screen is behind the prescription, so it’s not as simple as just glancing or catching it in my peripheral vision. In my experience, I’d get a notification, look up, and then have to wait for my eyes to refocus before I could see what was going on. That’s not a big deal if it’s just the time or an icon telling you there’s a new WhatsApp, but it’s hard to read full sentences of text.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Personally, I found the display to be too close and too unnaturally placed for me to comfortably use it. I tried every adjustment possible to make it easier to use, even wearing them in silly ways to no avail. And this gets worse when you’re being asked to engage with the lengthy responses produced by its “Proactive” AI. Reading paragraphs of text on a 3.6mm screen is a one-way ticket to the sort of eye pain you’d normally only experience after downing a pint of ice cream.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">If you struggle to use those sorts of displays, then you’ll also struggle with the other text-heavy features the glasses offer. Most notably, its “reactive” AI, translation and Cheatsheet — its teleprompter-esque service for presentations.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Once you’ve followed the YouTube clip guiding you through setup, you’ll control your glasses via Halliday’s app. Set that up, make sure it’s connected, and it’ll be easy enough to run things just with the ring. You’ll need to memorize a cumbersome control scheme, which has to work to overcome its limited inputs. For instance, it’s easy enough to think that a click would be the dominant action, with the tap acting as the secondary one — but it’s the other way around. Initially, I was clicking (which activates the notification center) rather than tapping to access a menu item. That the clickpad is so small means you’ll do a fair bit of scrolling, too.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Halliday’s focus on lightness extended beyond what you’d wear on your face, but how much you’d need to carry in your bag on the go. Rather than build a charging case, the USB-C charger is on the temple tip, hidden behind a little rubber gasket. Except, the gasket is very difficult to actually flick out of its recess and often gets pushed further in. It got to the point where I keep a paperclip on hand to flick it out when it’s time to recharge.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The control ring is charged magnetically, so you will be carrying around a little dongle and USB-C cable. It’s not much extra weight to carry, but it is yet another thing to deal with. Plus, if you’re in a hurry for power, you’ll need to charge two devices simultaneously rather than just putting both in a charging case. Look, maybe this is a gripe too far, but it feels like Halliday attempted to reduce complexity and, in doing so, made things a hell of a lot fiddlier when it comes to charging.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Halliday pitched its glasses as being the “first” with a “proactive” AI running in the background of your day to offer context-based assistance. In one of the company’s examples, the system is listening to a conversation, enabling its wearer to act like a know-it-all. Certainly, it was this feature that most intrigued me as I’m sure we’ve all hoped for an electronic version of Gary from <em>Veep</em> every now and again.&nbsp;</span></p>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The Star Trek-esque promise of such a system clashes with its reality, since the proactive AI is just a constantly-running chatbot which treats everything as a prompt. Here’s the app’s own record of a conversation I had in which every line it heard gets its own response. It will even try to respond to the ums, ahs and other non-speech glue that holds speech together, saying that the line “doesn’t contain any factual claims.” And, don’t forget, all of this is being pushed into your peripheral vision for as long as the AI is active. Bear in mind you only have a limited amount of time credits with which to use the AI. So you can’t have it running in the background 24/7, but on this evidence, I’m not sure that you would ever want to. Hou says the company is working on improving this but, at this point, it doesn’t feel like a feature you’d want to use on a regular basis.</span></p> 
<h3 style="text-align:left;" id="a3ef1583-68b9-4e6b-87a5-1fd3dfe0afaf"><span style="color:rgb(67, 67, 67);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Reactive AI</span></h3> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The glasses’ reactive AI, meanwhile, is in dire need of some sort of help, since it often refused to answer my questions and, when it did, it often got its facts wrong. On September 18, I asked it who the current manager of (Portuguese football team) Benfica was, since it had just hired a new manager. But it told me the name of the old one, who’d been fired on August 31 — which isn’t ideal. Similarly, questions around basic facts concerning geography and science were either met with blank responses or lackluster answers. I know that plenty of AIs aren’t perfect for up-to-the-minute information, but what else would you want to use it for?</span></p> 
<h3 style="text-align:left;" id="bd8cb6bc-946d-4a54-8bb4-abf7aa37859c"><span style="color:rgb(67, 67, 67);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Audio memo and transcription</span></h3> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">You can record audio memos through the glasses if you need to express an idea in a hurry. It’s worth noting, however, that the microphone quality is poor. It sounds like the sort of crunchy radio microphone audio you last heard in a live news broadcast from the 1980s. Given how much of the interaction with these glasses is through speech, the poor microphone quality is baffling. Sure, save on weight as much as possible, but not for the thing the glasses need to do one of their most critical jobs.</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Once recorded, you can then listen back to the memo in the app, and can even ask the system for a transcription. Bafflingly, you can’t just press the button and then go do something else in the app. If you want your words turned into (an approximate) text record, you’ll need to leave that specific pane open while it runs. I found this out after pressing the button a third time and, rather than moving to the next memo to get that transcribed, I was distracted by something on my laptop and then saw the transcript <em>finally</em> appear before my eyes.</span></p> 
<h3 style="text-align:left;" id="54f5c256-3c4c-43a7-8caa-8e1648a9add1"><span style="color:rgb(67, 67, 67);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Music</span></h3> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Halliday’s app claims it’s possible to use the glasses’ built-in speakers in place of your wireless headphones. And, yes, it is <em>technically</em> possible to do this, in the same way that it’s <em>technically</em> possible to steer a motorcycle with your feet or carve a block of marble with an iPhone. I’m no audiophile, but if you’re looking for a better listening experience, listening to a broken record player from a mile away with two paper cups and some string is probably better. It’s very much the sort of option you’d go for if you had to listen to something in the direst of emergencies — and then never again.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">If you opted to back Halliday’s glasses on Kickstarter, you could pick them up for $399. For the rest of us, it will be available to order through the Halliday website for $499, with shipping due to begin at the end of October. It is available in one of three colors: Black, Gradient or Tortoisehell, with prescription lenses included in the price, at least at the time of publication. If you order now, you will also get the control ring for free, but it will eventually cost $69.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In terms of rival smart glasses, the closest competitor is likely </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/brilliant-labs-launches-its-second-generation-smart-glasses-130000032.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Brilliant Labs’ Halo</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, which uses a similar standalone microLED display with the same focus on AI. Given the display option, if you think you’d struggle with Halliday, it’s easy to assume you won’t be happy with these either. Halo will set you back $299, although it’s worth mentioning that it’ll only be sold in limited quantities.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">One alternative is </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/rokids-smartglasses-are-surprisingly-capable-153027590.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Rokid’s forthcoming Glasses</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, which are equipped with the sort of waveguide display lenses I prefer. The company promises it’ll offer real-time translation, a built-in AI assistant and an outward-facing camera. Would-be backers can pick them up for $549 on Kickstarter at present, with a retail price likely closer to $750 when they launch toward the end of this year.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But if I was looking for a product that did a lot of what Halliday offered, albeit in a much more polished package, it’d be </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/even-realities-g1-review-limited-but-effective-smart-glasses-140059586.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Even Realities G1</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">. There’s a lot to like about the G1, as it offers a more limited feature set, but one in which things actually work a lot better. The one downside is the price, since you’ll need to fork out $600 for the glasses and another $150 for the lenses.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The big tech elephant in the room, of course, is </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Meta’s Ray-Ban Display</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> glasses that seem to pay off on the promise of smart glasses’ premise. They’re obviously pricey, retailing for $799, but have all of the gadgets and gizmos you are likely to want and need. It ships with a 600 x 600 full color display in the lens, letting you engage with notifications a lot more like you would if you were using your phone.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">My issues with the display certainly didn’t endear Halliday to me. But I think that the product is less than the sum of its parts, both from a hardware and software standpoint. The “proactive” AI is perhaps the biggest disappointment, given it’s just a chatbot responding to every interaction like a prompt. In every facet, the company prioritized things that weren’t worth the effort. What appeared to be a series of great ideas on paper is, in reality, not all that.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Japan&#39;s government has asked OpenAI not to infringe on anime and manga content that it called &quot;irreplaceable treasures,&quot; according to a report from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2510/10/news115.html"><em>ITMedia</em></a> seen by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japanese-government-calls-on-sora-2-maker-openai-to-refrain-from-copyright-infringement-says-characters-from-manga-and-anime-are-irreplaceable-treasures-that-japan-boasts-to-the-world"><em>IGN</em></a>. The request was made by a key minister in charge of AI and IP in response to numerous videos from <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html">OpenAI&#39;s Sora 2 generator</a> that use <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://gizmodo.com/the-first-24-hours-of-sora-2-chaos-copyright-violations-sam-altman-shoplifting-and-more-2000666216">copyrighted material</a> from Japanese studios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We have requested OpenAI not to engage in any actions that could constitute copyright infringement,&quot; said cabinet minister Minoru Kiuchi at a press conference last week. &quot;Anime and manga are irreplaceable treasures that we can be proud of around the world.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Launched on October 1, OpenAI&#39;s Sora 2 can generate 1080p videos up to 20 seconds long with sound. The company also released the Sora app that uses Sora 2 to  generate TikTok-style videos of nearly anything. Anime has been a key theme, with many short videos replicating copyrighted materials from franchises like DragonBall and Pokémon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the demand, Japan has been one of the more progressive nations when it comes to artificial intelligence. The nation&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/05/28/japan/japan-ai-law/">AI Promotion Act</a> aims to boost the use of AI as an economic growth driver, while also outlining guidelines around copyright infringement. However, the topic of enforcement is still fuzzy so the government is trying to get a better grip on it. &quot;Japan bears a responsibility to take the lead on making rules [around AI and copyright], precisely because we are a country... [that creates] anime, games, and music,&quot; said parliament member Akihisa Shiozaki <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://note.com/akihisa_shiozaki/n/n40ebca032aff">on his blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, OpenAI said it had contacted studios to give them the option of opting out of Sora 2 training on their materials, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-new-sora-video-generator-require-copyright-holders-opt-out-wsj-reports-2025-09-29/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported. The new process requires movie studios and other content owners to explicitly ask OpenAI to exclude their copyright material from videos generated by Sora. It&#39;s not known which, if any, Japanese studios the company has contacted.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/japan-asks-openai-not-to-infringe-on-irreplaceable-manga-and-anime-content-120008580.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Still running Windows 10 on your PC? Did you know that as of October 14, Microsoft moved the software to its "end of life" phase? So while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. The good news is you still have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html">three options</a> to make sure your computer remains secure:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>You can <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-new-computers-to-replace-your-old-windows-10-pc-134500000.html">buy a new PC</a> that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook).</p></li>
<li><p>Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Option three is pretty easy — and can now be done for free in many cases — so we'll focus on that one here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-sign-up-for-windows-10-extended-security-updates-on-your-computer">How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer</h2>
<p>We can <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-pressured-to-extend-free-windows-10-security-updates-in-most-of-europe-164533056.html">question Microsoft's motives</a> for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely.</p>
<p>At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-1-make-sure-your-pc-is-up-to-date"><strong>Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date</strong></h3>
<p>You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings &gt; System &gt; About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-2-make-sure-youre-using-an-administrator-account"><strong>Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account</strong></h3>
<p>If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see "Administrator" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings &gt; Your Info.)</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-3-verify-if-your-pc-is-eligible-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-or-not"><strong>Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not)</strong></h3>
<p>If you see an option to upgrade to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html">Windows 11</a>, just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-4-enroll-in-extended-security-updates"><strong>Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates</strong></h3>
<p>Sign up for ESU by selecting Update &amp; Security from the Settings menu. Click the "Enroll Now" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it).</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/8a58c8c0-a60f-11f0-b577-a6fb08ea3ef9" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/8a58c8c0-a60f-11f0-b577-a6fb08ea3ef9" style="height:1378px;width:1364px;" data-uuid="a8387b70-b45f-3b79-a56c-59f8f763068d"><figcaption>Find out if you need to update your computer. (Screenshot/Engadget)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not seeing the "Enroll now" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above).</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/bb9c0550-a60f-11f0-b7ed-52b616ac3b09" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/bb9c0550-a60f-11f0-b7ed-52b616ac3b09" style="height:1512px;width:1250px;" data-uuid="937b2742-d521-33a5-b34e-964fc8a83892"><figcaption>By enrolling in Extended Security Updates, you'll have another year before you need to upgrade to Windows 11. (Screenshots/Engadget)</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-5-choose-your-upgrade-method"><strong>Step 5: Choose your upgrade method</strong></h3>
<p>Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to use your administrator account to get started.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDjeKN1_Es"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e52590d0-a60f-11f0-96ff-415266e25201" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e52590d0-a60f-11f0-96ff-415266e25201" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" data-uuid="ab17ee67-0c79-3a86-b04a-7ee38e44c5dc"><figcaption>Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube)</figcaption></figure></a>
<p>That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-pressured-to-extend-free-windows-10-security-updates-in-most-of-europe-164533056.html">no strings attached</a>.) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this "free" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe.</p>
<p>The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=973badc7-4f72-4f95-82dc-34d0ba6aff68&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=5+GB+of+storage&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL21pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUvb25lZHJpdmUvZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTczYmFkYzctNGY3Mi00Zjk1LTgyZGMtMzRkMGJhNmFmZjY4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL21pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUvb25lZHJpdmUvZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb76BKdsZUEVk6dLEl2FB2BKQaUjjCPoN1dC7mQw4-c5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fonedrive%2Ffree-online-cloud-storage" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/free-online-cloud-storage">5 GB of storage</a>. Anything more, and you’ll need to pay up for Microsoft's OneDrive services. But thankfully, you can turn off anything you don't want to back up by going to Settings &gt; OneDrive and toggling off options like Documents, Pictures and Videos to get in under the free threshold to start.</p>
<p>Once you're signed in, a window will pop up that says "Add this device to receive Extended Security Updates." Click Add Device to enroll it. Click Done.</p>
<p>A note: Thanks to YouTube's <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ExplainingComputers">Explaining Computers channel</a>, where we grabbed the screenshot above (since our test PC was already signed up for cloud backups, and didn't provide the splash screen to choose options). You can watch their <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDjeKN1_Es">full video</a> if you'd like a deeper dive into the process.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-thats-it-youre-done-until-next-year"><strong>That's it, you're done! (Until next year)</strong></h2>
<p>You've got 12 more months to figure out an alternative upgrade path to Windows 11. If anything changes next year, we'll update this story with what your next steps are.</p>

It’s the cheapest set we’ve tested with active noise cancellation and transparency mode, though neither feature is all that effective. Like the Go Sport+, it also relies on a short USB-C cable tethered to its case to charge. But it actually sounds OK for the price: not particularly wide or detailed, but not harsh either, with decent energy and bass punch. The tiny earpieces fit snugly and isolate a good chunk of background noise passively. They’re also IP55-rated, while the case is similarly compact. There’s no auto-pausing, but you can connect to two devices at once, the touch controls work well and JLab’s app makes it easy to adjust settings. Battery life is alright at six to seven hours, too, though this is another one that’ll get wrecked by the wind if you take a call outside.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-biggest-differences-between-cheaper-earbuds-and-more-premium-models">What are the biggest differences between cheaper earbuds and more premium models?</h3> 
<p>A higher price does not guarantee higher quality. We'd take a pair like the Anker Soundcore Space A40 over many alternatives priced well over $100. Broadly speaking, though, the pricier components used by the best wireless earbuds let them put out a more detailed and versatile sound, more powerful active noise cancellation and a more complete list of features like multipoint connectivity, faster pairing, wear detection or wireless charging. They generally feel less flimsy in the hand, and their companion software tends to be less buggy. Battery life may be longer as well. But you have to look at these things on a case-by-case basis: Some earbuds justify their cost, others very much do not.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-improve-the-sound-of-cheap-wireless-earbuds">Can you improve the sound of cheap wireless earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Evaluating audio quality is always subjective to some extent — what I find "bloated," you may consider "fun" or "lively." In general, if a set of earbuds is tuned poorly or built with cheap materials, you can't magically fix that. However, most new pairs allow you to adjust their EQ curve through software, so you can sculpt the frequency ranges in a way that better suits your tastes, at least somewhat. Also, remember that fit is king: If your in-ear headphones aren't sealed tight enough, they'll inevitably sound less detailed, with weaker bass response and worse isolation from outside noise. Consider trying different ear tips in that case.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cheap-earbuds-sound-as-good-as-airpods">Can cheap earbuds sound as good as AirPods?</h3> 
<p>A few can, sure! I'd take the top-end <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">AirPods Pro 3</a> over any of the top picks in this guide, but they are far from unassailable. Meanwhile, the <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">AirPods 4</a>'s unsealed design prevents them from pumping out truly deep bass, and I find them to sound a bit veiled in the treble. (They're still a level above the open-back Amazon Echo Buds, though.) The big appeal with AirPods is how tightly they integrate with other Apple devices: You open them with an iPhone and they just work. No other earbuds can replicate that, cheap or otherwise, because Apple uses proprietary tech that prevents competitors from offering the same features. Again, price and advertising budget has little to do with how good a set of earbuds is. (This is a silly question, but we know some casual buyers will inevitably ask it.)</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-recent-updates">Recent updates</h2> 
<p><strong>October 2025</strong>: We’ve made a few light edits to ensure our recommendations are still up-to-date.</p> 
<p><strong>June 2025</strong>: We’ve ensured our picks are still accurate and added testing notes on Skullcandy’s Method 360 ANC.</p> 
<p><strong>April 2025</strong>: The JLab Go Sport+ replaces the older JLab Go Air Sport as our “best for workouts” pick. We’ve also added testing notes on the EarFun Air Pro 4 and JLab Go Pop ANC, removing our blurbs for their predecessors along the way.</p> 
<p><strong>December 2024</strong>: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and moved the aging JLab Go Air Pop and EarFun Air Pro 3 from honorable mentions to our “others we tested” section.</p> 
<p><strong>September 2024</strong>: We’ve added notes on a handful of other budget wireless earbuds that we’ve tested but fall short of our top picks, which remain unchanged.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>June 2024</strong>: We’ve checked this guide to ensure that all of our picks are still in stock.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html"> live TV streaming services</a> over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now.

<p>We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney's streaming prices chart</a>, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing as of October 21, 2025, accounting for the latest price hike.</p>

The entertainment brand is working with Glance, an AI company that has received backing from Google and developed an on-device AI tool alongside the tech giant. The new AI-powered screensavers will begin rolling out to DirecTV Gemini devices early next year.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Glance&#39;s </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/glance-to-deliver-new-immersive-content-experiences-to-streaming-on-directv-302582769.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">press release</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> about the deal presents the tech&#39;s capability in lofty language: &quot;Shop smarter by discovering and engaging with products and brands in an AI-led virtual and visually immersive shopping experience that feels native to TV.&quot; In practice, however, it sounds like a viewer can use the Glance mobile app to do things like insert themselves or other people into AI-generated videos appearing on their televisions. Then they can use the voice remote to alter the person&#39;s wardrobe and then buy items similar to the AI-generated images from your phone. </span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">&quot;We are making television a lean-in experience versus lean back,&quot; Rajat Wanchoo, Glance&#39;s group vice president of commercial partnerships, told </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798174/directv-glance-ai-shoppable-screensavers" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><em>The Verge</em></span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, which initially picked up news of the partnership. &quot;We want to give users a chance to use the advancements that have happened in generative AI to create a ChatGPT moment for themselves, but on TV.&quot;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It&#39;s unclear how many DirecTV customers want to have a ChatGPT moment for themselves, but questions about whether people want or need a feature hasn&#39;t stopped most AI companies from pushing ahead with business plans. The press release doesn&#39;t note whether viewers will be able to turn off this screensaver feature once it&#39;s live.</span></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/directv-will-start-replacing-screensavers-with-ai-generated-ads-next-year-224436035.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gregg Mayles, the director of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and designer on <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, has announced that he&#39;s left Rare. News of Mayles&#39; exit <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"><ins>was first reported</ins></a> in July 2025 during a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html"><ins>rash of layoffs and game cancellations</ins></a> across Xbox Games Studios, but the short poem he <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778"><ins>shared on X</ins></a> today makes it official.</p>
<p>With a 36-year tenure at the studio, Mayles saw its transition from an exclusive Nintendo partner to a Microsoft subsidiary. He helped design games like <em>Battletoads,</em> created Banjo-Kazooie and when studio founders Tim and Chris Stamper left in 2007, stepped up and became Rare&#39;s creative director. Mayles also led the team behind <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, one of Rare&#39;s modern successes.</p>

<p>The studio has been supporting <em>Sea of Thieves</em> with new content since it was released in 2018, but was also working on a new project, <em>Everwild</em>, that was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-rare-everwild-xbox.html"><ins>announced in 2019</ins></a>. The game went through a troubled development process over the last few years, and Rare <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/why-wasnt-everwild-at-e3-its-been-completely-rebooted/"><ins>reportedly started from scratch in 2021</ins></a> with Mayles taking over as director. Microsoft&#39;s decision to cancel the game and layoff staff at the studio this summer is likely one of the reasons he left.</p>
<p>Losing Mayles is just one example of Microsoft&#39;s self-inflicted wounds from 2025. The company not only made cuts at <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html"><ins>Halo Studios</ins></a> and Forza Motorsport developer <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side"><ins>Turn 10</ins></a>, it also increased the prices of both <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html">Xbox consoles</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">Game Pass Ultimate</a>.  All of these changes are seemingly in service of shifting the Xbox business into something that&#39;s more focused on subscriptions and game publishing, but the transition definitely seems like a painful one.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-confirms-hes-left-rare-220828667.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to avoid paying billions of dollars in fines for violating the European Union&#39;s Digital Markets Act, Google is considering changing how search results are displayed, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-offers-tweak-search-results-eu-antitrust-fine-looms-2025-10-14/"><em>Reuters </em>reports</a>. EU regulators <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eus-new-charges-against-google-could-lead-to-at-least-35-billion-in-fines-165850585.html">first took issue</a> with Google&#39;s Search and Play Store businesses in March 2025, claiming it favored its own services in search results over third-party options and prevented developers from informing customers of alternative ways of accessing apps.</p>
<p>One of regulators main issues with Google Search was that Google appeared to favor results from services like Google Flights or Google Hotels over ones from &quot;vertical search services,&quot; providers that specialize in displaying search results from a specific industry, like Expedia or Hotels.com. To avoid fines, Google now wants Search to give VSS businesses equal treatment in results.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We will create the opportunity for each VSS to show its own box on Search. A VSS box will be populated with results from that VSS inventory,&quot; Google said in a proposal viewed by <em>Reuters</em>. Results from Google&#39;s own services will exist with the same formatting alongside, and the winning VSS box will be displayed in search results based on &quot;objective and non-discriminatory criteria.&quot; Importantly, search results from actual airlines and car rental companies won&#39;t be excluded, they&#39;ll also appear in a box &quot;above or below the VSS box depending on the relevance to the user&#39;s query.&quot;</p>
<p>Engadget has asked Google to comment on <em>Reuters</em>&#39;<em>&nbsp;</em>report and to confirm the details of its proposed changes to Google Search. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Google faces significant scrutiny from the EU because of its monopolistic control over its various platforms and services. The threat of fines from the DMA has forced Apple to open up its products to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html">third-party app stores</a>, among a host of other changes. Clearly, Google is willing to tweak what once seemed like untouchable pillars of its business to avoid fines, too. Whether these proposed changes will be enough for the regulators remains to be seen, though.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-reportedly-offers-to-tweak-search-results-to-avoid-eu-fine-193940005.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Customer service support company 5CA has released a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://5ca.com/blog/holding-statement-security-incident/">statement</a> contradicting <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-now-says-70000-government-ids-may-have-leaked-in-provider-hack-225753321.html">claims by Discord</a> that it was the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/discord-users-ids-and-data-compromised-in-customer-service-provider-hack-140053655.html">victim of a hack</a> last month. On October 3, Discord <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/discord-users-ids-and-data-compromised-in-customer-service-provider-hack-140053655.html">disclosed</a> a data breach that the company says included a “small number” of government IDs like driver’s licenses and passports, which some users had submitted to verify their ages. Days later the company updated <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">its statement</a> to name 5CA as the target of the hack, which Discord contracts as part of its customer service efforts. It also disclosed that the &quot;small number&quot; of government IDs encompasses roughly 70,000 users.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware of media reports naming 5CA as the cause of a data breach involving one of our clients. Contrary to these reports, we can confirm that none of 5CA’s systems were involved, and 5CA has not handled any government-issued IDs for this client. All our platforms and systems remain secure, and client data continues to be protected under strict data protection and security controls,&quot; the company’s statement reads in part. The company goes on to explicitly state &quot;the incident occurred outside of our systems and that 5CA was not hacked.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>5CA says that a preliminary investigation showed that the incident may have been the result of &quot;human error,&quot; though it offers no details as to what exactly that implies. In a recent interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-claim-discord-breach-exposed-data-of-55-million-users/"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a>, the hackers who claimed responsibility for the breach said they had access to Discord&#39;s Zendesk account for 58 hours on September 20. The group claims they gained entry through compromised login credentials belonging to a support agent employed by a third-party company.  Discord has not yet responded to the company’s claims.</p>

<p>A remote control for an ereader may seem silly to some, but avid readers will likely appreciate this accessory. It&#39;s basically a wireless page turner, so users can lay in bed and read all day without having to physically hold the device or prop a hand up to push a button every 30 seconds. Kobo is calling it &quot;the ideal reading companion.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It has been custom-built for Kobo products and will be available in both black and white, which matches the company&#39;s other products. It can integrate with any Kobo ereader with Bluetooth functionality, which includes the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kobo-libra-2-irl-153009550.html">Libra 2</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kobo-clara-colour-review-judging-books-by-their-covers-is-now-more-fun-130013382.html">well-reviewed Clara Colour</a>.</p>
<p>“In a Canadian winter, we know that sometimes maximum reading comfort means burrowing down in the blankets, tucking yourself in and not emerging until spring,” said Rakuten Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn. “The Kobo Remote is the perfect accessory for peak immersive reading; it’s an invitation to lounge deeper, multitask smarter and simply enjoy reading without limits, no matter whether your environment is beach or blankets.&quot;</p>
<p>The remote will be available in multiple regions, including the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Japan and many others. The company says it&#39;ll be sharing more details about the remote soon, but we aren&#39;t sure what details could be left to share. It&#39;s a remote control for an ereader. Maybe it can do one or two unexpected things.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kobo-made-a-remote-control-for-its-ereaders-185010955.html?src=rss]]></description>

And the announcement from OpenAI even acknowledges that its new council has no real power to guide its operations: &quot;We remain responsible for the decisions we make, but we’ll continue learning from this council, the Global Physician Network, policymakers, and more, as we build advanced AI systems in ways that support people’s well-being.&quot; It may become clearer how seriously OpenAI is taking this effort when it starts to disagree with the council, whether the company is genuinely committed to mitigating the serious risks of AI or whether this is a smoke and mirrors attempt to paper over its issues.</span></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/openai-forms-advisory-council-on-wellbeing-and-ai-183815365.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI plans to open the floodgates to more adult uses of ChatGPT starting in December, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128">a new post from CEO Sam Altman</a>. The company announced that it would add <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/following-teen-suicide-openai-explores-automatic-underage-user-restrictions-151948711.html">parental controls and automatic age detection features</a> in September, and it seems like a benefit of sorting out children from adults is an ability to offer more freedom in what ChatGPT can show users.</p>
<p>&quot;In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our &#39;treat adult users like adults&#39; principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,&quot; Altman says. Some avid ChatGPT users already regularly manipulate the chatbot to engage in NSFW conversations, but Altman&#39;s announcement sounds more like tacit approval from OpenAI that those use-cases are okay.</p>

<p>The company signaled something similar during its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canva-and-other-apps-can-now-connect-to-chatgpt-194830116.html">DevDay 2025 announcements</a>, when its new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-developer-guidelines#:~:text=Support%20for%20mature%20(18%2B)%20experiences%20will%20arrive%20once%20appropriate%20age%20verification%20and%20controls%20are%20in%20place.">guidelines</a> for developers creating apps for ChatGPT shared that &quot;support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place.&quot; After December, it sounds like adult interactions with ChatGPT or apps the chatbot can access are fair game.</p>
<p>All of these changes are being made in the shadow of disturbing stories of the seemingly negative influence ChatGPT can have on users, including <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">the death of 16-year old Adam Raine</a>, who allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his own suicide.</p>

It&#39;s hard to definitively say whether these tweaks have made a difference, but combined with age-gating, it&#39;s clear OpenAI feels comfortable giving its chatbot a longer leash.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-adults-use-chatgpt-for-erotica-starting-in-december-182417583.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Spotify is taking the video versions of some of its podcasts to another platform entirely: Netflix. Starting in the US in early 2026 (with more markets and shows to follow), Netflix will start offering sports, culture, lifestyle and true crime podcasts that Spotify Studios and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bill-simmons-spotify-global-sports-225758346.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">The Ringer</a> produce. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Nine sports podcasts will be available at the jump, including <em>The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Zach Lowe Show,  Fairway Rollin’</em> and The Ringer’s F1, fantasy football, NFL and NBA shows. Other video podcasts that are coming to Netflix include <em>The Rewatchables, The Recipe Club, Dissect, Conspiracy Theories </em>and <em>Serial Killers.</em></p><p style="text-align:left;">Netflix sees these podcasts as complementary to its current offerings (<em>The Ringer F1 Show</em>, for instance, will sit neatly alongside <em>Drive to Survive</em>). Of course, for Spotify, this is a way to get more eyeballs and eardrums on its original programming.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With TV viewing becoming <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/more-users-are-watching-youtube-on-tv-than-mobile-140035151.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a bigger priority for YouTube</a> over the last few years, this seems like a way for Netflix to bite back in the battle for consumer attention, given the prevalence of video podcasts on Google’s platform. Many people use streaming services for background comfort sound, and turning to podcasts or talk-radio style formats (something Disney+ also offers with <em>The Rich Eisen Show</em> on weekdays) may be a way for them to do that after pulling the plug on cable and broadcast TV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/some-spotify-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-180000074.html?src=rss]]></description>

These visual updates and new features will roll out globally starting this week.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The main update to YouTube is a redesigned video player that has made the icons and UI elements to obscure less content. This new player design will appear on mobile, web and TV devices. Some users have had access to this feature for about a month, so it may not be brand new to everyone. The seek feature where a viewer can double-tap to skip has also been updated in a way that YouTube says is &quot;more modern and less intrusive&quot; and transitions between tabs have also been upgraded on mobile.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">For those of you who spend a lot of time in the comments, you&#39;ll see a new threaded approach to replies. This update aims &quot;to provide a more focused reading experience within the replies panel.&quot; The process of adding videos to playlists and the Watch Later queue has also been simplified and adjusted to be a &quot;smoother and more visual&quot; experience. Finally, some content will start displaying little animations when you hit the like button. The blog post gives music videos and sports videos as examples of where users may start seeing the flashier visual.</span></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-rolls-out-its-redesigned-video-player-globally-174609883.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">X has long been a hotbed for fake accounts, bots and other scammy behavior. Many of those dynamics have been exacerbated by the rise of paid verification, which boosts the visibility of anyone who pays for a subscription. Now, the company is running a small experiment that could help users better identify potentially suspicious accounts.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The service is starting to test a new &quot;about this account&quot; feature that will provide details about when an account joined the platform, where the person running it is based, how many times the username has been changed and how the account is connected to X. The feature is a lot like the &quot;page transparency&quot; information on Facebook, which provides similar details about when a given page was created and where the people running it are based.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">&quot;When you read content on X, you should be able to verify its authenticity,&quot; X&#39;s head of product, Nikita Bier, shared in </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1978132382868988310" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">a post</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> about the change. &quot;This is critical to getting a pulse on important issues happening in the world.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">If fully rolled out, this type of feature could help people on X understand a lot of common scams and other deceptive behavior on the platform. For example, scammers often change the handle of a recently compromised account in order to trick an account&#39;s existing followers. And understanding the location of an account could help users root out people lying about their identity.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">However, it sounds like it could be some time before the feature is implemented in a way that could be broadly useful.

The Nova 7 Gen 2 offers significantly improved battery life, with an increase of around 40 percent when compared to the original version. This translates to 54 hours of use per charge, which is a mighty fine metric. There&#39;s quick-charging that can provide six more hours of use in 15 minutes at the outlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It charges via USB-C and can simultaneously play audio from both a 2.4GHz wireless connection and Bluetooth audio. This means that users can mix and match audio sources, which comes in handy when gaming. The headset connects wirelessly to all major gaming consoles, in addition to PCs and phones.</p>

<p>The Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 integrates with the company&#39;s mobile app. This offers more than 200 presets for specific games, all of which adjust the EQ to match what&#39;s being played. On PC, the presets will automatically adjust depending on the game.</p>
<p>These are headphones intended for gaming, so they also include a noise-cancelling microphone. This little boom mic can be hidden within the headset and disabled when using a standalone microphone.</p>
<p>As for aesthetics, the Nova 7 looks a lot like the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steel-series-new-artics-nova-pro-gaming-headset-specs-features-price-162759204.html"><ins>company&#39;s high-end headsets</ins></a>. It&#39;s available in three colors, including black, white and magenta. The headset is available to purchase right now and costs $200. It does lack a few features included with its higher-priced cousins, like the swappable battery system and active noise cancellation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/steelseries-updated-nova-7-gaming-headset-offers-much-better-battery-life-171435527.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-10-14/spotify-family-plan-managed-accounts/">introduced</a> a new &quot;managed accounts&quot; feature aimed at younger listeners. Initially <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-09-13/spotify-pilots-new-music-experience-for-young-listeners-on-family-plans/">piloted</a> last year and launching in seven new markets, including the US, today, it allows parents and guardians with a Spotify Premium Family plan to allocate their children a dedicated profile with their own personalized recommendations and custom playlists.</p>
<p>The idea is that the adults can filter out explicit content, limit the playback of certain artists and hide video playback features, including <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canvas-loops-tiktok-feed-clone-131103707.html">Canvas</a>, should they want to. Users on this profile can’t use interactivity features like Messages either.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Perhaps most importantly of all for some, a managed account also ensures that your personal <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/engadget-wrapped-the-music-we-listened-to-the-most-in-2024-143150906.html">Wrapped</a> results at the end of the year aren’t dominated by whatever TikTok-viral songs the kids have been obsessively playing on repeat for months — and they won&#39;t mess with your <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-adds-genre-controls-to-discover-weekly-133531543.html">Discover Weekly</a> algorithm either. Spotify&#39;s &#39;Exclude from your Taste Profile&#39; <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-exclude-from-your-taste-profile-recommendations-kids-songs-211001995.html/1000">feature</a> already offers a way of keeping the nonsense your kids might be listening to away from your own recommended content, but this feels like a cleaner option for families.</p>
<p>Standard Spotify Premium features like daylist and the aforementioned Discover Weekly remain available to someone using a managed account, making it a better option for kids becoming interested in music (they may even have gotten hooked on a band you’ve been listening to in the car) than the Spotify Kids app, which is very much designed for the &#39;<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/baby-shark-10-billion-views-youtube-182604578.html">Baby Shark</a>&#39; devotees. It’s probably helpful to think of a managed account as a bridge between that and an unrestricted Premium account where all the music in the world is at your fingertips.</p>
<p>To set up a managed account, the plan owner has to go into their account settings within the Spotify app and select &quot;Add a Member,&quot; followed by selecting &quot;Add a listener aged under 13.&quot; The app will provide further instructions from there. As a reminder, a Spotify Premium Family plan is required to set up a managed account. This currently costs $20 per month.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-managed-accounts-will-help-keep-your-kids-from-wrecking-your-music-taste-profile-154406843.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX&#39;s second-generation Starship vehicle has just made a graceful exit. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-11">achieved</a> every major objective it set for the super-heavy lift vehicle&#39;s 11th flight test, the second-gen Starship&#39;s final flight, which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-will-attempt-starships-11th-flight-test-on-monday-204237829.html">launched</a> from Starbase in Texas on October 13. It followed another successful test in August, which saw Starship <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html">deploy its payload</a> for the first time ever. Before those two most recent flights, SpaceX suffered a series of failures: Starship exploded during its ascent stage in the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html">seventh</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-again-during-its-eighth-test-flight-140018375.html">eighth</a> tests, and it failed to deploy its payload during its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-ninth-starship-test-flight-reaches-space-but-fails-to-deploy-fake-satellites-120057474.html">ninth test</a>. Another Starship vehicle <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-on-the-ground-during-a-routine-test-130025133.html">blew up on the ground</a> during a routine test while SpaceX was preparing for its 10th flight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the vehicle&#39;s 33 Raptor engines ignited upon launch, and the stage separation and first-stage ascent went smoothly. The Super Heavy booster splashed down into the ocean as planned, while Starship was able to deploy all its Starlink simulators before re-entering the atmosphere. During its reentry burn, SpaceX intentionally stressed the vehicle to determine the capabilities of its heatshield. And with just a few minutes left to the flight, the vehicle <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1977893017421070424">executed</a> a banking maneuver to &quot;mimic the trajectory that future missions returning to Starbase will fly.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says it will now focus on developing the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy. It has multiple versions of the vehicle and the booster being prepared for tests at the moment, and it expects them to be used for the first Starship orbital flights and operational payload missions.&nbsp;</p>

If you haven't thought about adding more storage to the console, now's the time to do so.

While the cards he's tried out so far didn't perform identically in our benchmark tests, the differences in overall performance and load times will be tough for most people to notice. Thankfully, the ones he's tested so far have been good — there isn't a bad one in the bunch, and while the most consistent performer was the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DFQGVLYF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad9ae3bb-2fa4-4fd7-9ab6-06704ecd6aba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon+Canada&amp;linkText=SanDisk+microSD+Express+card&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAQsi4S9goXIZjlc0sgaX0p5xMz45qWMbEQ5lcE9GD3M-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSanDisk-256GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-256G-GN4NN%2Fdp%2FB0DFQGVLYF%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-256G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQGVLYF/?">SanDisk microSD Express card</a>, you won't really sacrifice by getting a different one.

<p>PNY's card in particular was actually slightly faster than SanDisk's in our testing when it came to moving games from the card back to the Switch 2's internal storage. However, it was a bit slower in writing games to the card itself. That just means you may wait a few extra minutes before you can open Mario Kart World and get to racing, but for most people, the difference will be negligible.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/pick-up-this-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-microsd-express-card-for-less-than-40-134147278.html?src=rss]]></description>

This MF Doom-looking full-face mask offers quite a different experience from the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/therabody-theraface-pro-hands-on-price-face-massage-120036033.html">pre-existing TheraFace Pro</a>. The Pro is essentially a face massager, but the Mask Glo is a giant mask that uses LED lights to &quot;reduce fine lines and wrinkles, firm and tighten skin and even tone and texture.&quot;</p>
<p>The company promises results in &quot;as little as eight weeks&quot; with daily 12-minute sessions. The mask has been cleared by the FDA and includes 504 medical-grade LEDs to deliver &quot;an effective, full-face treatment.&quot; It also doubles as a Halloween mask if you are so inclined. Tis the season. The TheraFace Mask Glo is available to order today and costs $380.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Theragun Mini Plus is a portable version of its popular massage gun, but with one feature <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/theragun-4th-generation-massage-guns-mini-price-launch-date-130058268.html">missing from the original Mini</a>. This one has heat. It combines &quot;percussive massage with consistent, rapid heat.&quot; Therabody says this results in a &quot;benefits 3x faster than percussive massage alone.&quot;</p>

<p>It features three massage speeds, three heat levels and app-guided routines to target specific muscle groups. The gun is TSA-approved, so bring it on a plane. The Theragun Mini Plus is available today and costs $280.</p>
<p>The company also released a new version of the Theragun Prime massage gun, which costs $330, and the Theragun Sense massage gun. That last one features an LCD screen and real-time pressure feedback to make sure people are using it right. It costs $300.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/therabody-just-introduced-the-theraface-mask-glo-which-uses-leds-to-reduce-wrinkles-123044315.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TiVo has confirmed that it has stopped selling its DVR set-top boxes, marking the end of an era that changed how we watch television forever. As first reported earlier this month by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/tivo-stops-selling-dvrs-marking-the-end-of-an-era/"><em><ins>Cord Cutters News</ins></em></a>, TiVo Corporation quietly pulled its once-groundbreaking digital video recorder from its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.tivo.com/"><ins>website</ins></a>. Holding company Xperi later confirmed that the listing was removed on October 1.</p>
<p>“I can confirm that as of October 1, 2025, TiVo stopped selling physical DVR products, including hardware and accessories, both online and through agents,” a TiVo spokesperson confirmed to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/times-up-for-a-timeshifting-trailblazer-tivo-discontinues-its-standalone"><em><ins>PCMag</ins></em></a>. “TiVo no longer manufactures hardware, and our remaining inventory is now depleted, though we will continue to offer support for the products going forward.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The TiVo box revolutionized television upon its launch in 1999, allowing viewers to pause, rewind and record live television. There was a time when you would just miss the start of a show if you weren’t punctual, and you’d have to sync grabbing a snack with a commercial during the big game. You also had to actually watch the commercials, something that is unfortunately making a comeback with an increase in <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflixs-ad-tier-has-attracted-more-than-70-million-subscribers-162011582.html"><ins>ad-supported streaming</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The DVR pioneer is now a software company. It has been producing TiVo OS almost exclusively in the European market since 2022, though the smart TV OS <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/tivo-os-is-coming-to-the-us-on-sharp-tvs-213938244.html"><ins>premiered in the US</ins></a> this year via Sharp. “The Sharp Smart TV Powered by TiVo” launched as a 55-inch QLED display with 4K resolution and HDR support. TiVo OS functions like many other television operating systems, aggregating streaming services and offering its own library of free and paid content.</p>
<p>TiVo will still offer customer support for its now-discontinued boxes, which bodes well for customers who have purchased a lifetime plan.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tivo-has-discontinued-its-dvr-boxes-123037999.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">budgeting app</a>. There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 30 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code <strong>WELCOME </strong>at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $30.</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-budgeting-apps-is-30-percent-off-right-now-174011108.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA&#39;s DGX Spark AI computer revealed <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidias-spark-desktop-ai-supercomputer-arrives-this-summer-200351998.html">earlier this year</a> goes on sale today for $3,999, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-dgx-spark-arrives-for-worlds-ai-developers">announced</a>. Though relatively tiny, it hosts the the company&#39;s entire AI platform including GPUs and CPUs, along with NVIDIA&#39;s AI software stack &quot;into a system small enough for a lab or an office,&quot; NVIDIA said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spark isn&#39;t something you&#39;d buy to play <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em>, though. It&#39;s designed to give developers, researchers and data scientists enough computer power to run complex AI models. Early recipients of the PCs include Anaconda, Google, Hugging Face, Meta and Microsoft. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang even hand-delivered a unit to Elon Musk at SpaceX&#39;s headquarter in Starbase, Texas.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The DGX has plenty of power on offer despite its diminutive 2.6 pound size. It boasts NVIDIA&#39;s GB10 super system-on-chip that weds a 20-core ARM CPU with a Blackwell GPU powered by the same number of cores as an RTX 5070 GPU. It&#39;s outfitted with 128GB of LPDDR5x RAM shared between the CPU and GPU and includes 4TB of NVMe storage, along with four USB-C ports, Wi-Fi 7 and an HDMI connector. NVDIA calls it &quot;the world’s smallest AI supercomputer.&quot;</p>
<p>The DGX Spark runs Nvidia&#39;s DGX OS, a custom version of Ubuntu Linux that&#39;s configured with AI software. With that, developers can access NVIDIA AI models, libraries and microservices in order to do chores like refining image generation or creating AI chatbots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DGX Spark is also an entry point for similar machines. Other vendors like Dell, HP, Lenovo and ASUS showed off similar AI-oriented mini PC&#39;s at Computex this year using the same GB10 chip, with Acer&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Acer;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=56197a86-8c27-4ba2-9aa1-20de6e52c761&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=17f0e498-c9ae-4488-bb54-eed5f5bda437&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Acer&amp;linkText=Veriton+GN100&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hY2VyLmNvbS91cy1lbi9kZXNrdG9wcy1hbmQtYWxsLWluLW9uZXMvdmVyaXRvbi13b3Jrc3RhdGlvbnMvdmVyaXRvbi1nbjEwMC1haS1taW5pLXdvcmtzdGF0aW9uIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxN2YwZTQ5OC1jOWFlLTQ0ODgtYmI1NC1lZWQ1ZjViZGE0MzciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjZXIuY29tL3VzLWVuL2Rlc2t0b3BzLWFuZC1hbGwtaW4tb25lcy92ZXJpdG9uLXdvcmtzdGF0aW9ucy92ZXJpdG9uLWduMTAwLWFpLW1pbmktd29ya3N0YXRpb24ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUHWyqhPYO8SHfgoZtG7eJlAHMB5bLm09Uj1RWp2AMSw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fus-en%2Fdesktops-and-all-in-ones%2Fveriton-workstations%2Fveriton-gn100-ai-mini-workstation" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.acer.com/us-en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/veriton-workstations/veriton-gn100-ai-mini-workstation">Veriton GN100</a> being one example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DGX Spark mini PC is <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/developer/dgx-spark/">now on sale for $3,999</a> through NVIDIA and its partners. While not cheap, it&#39;s a drop in the bucket for AI developers and all of the companies listed above, and considering the hardware inside, the price doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable. NVIDIA is also working on the DGX Station that will feature GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Desktop Superchip, with 20 petaflops of performance and 784GB of unified system memory. A price has yet to be announced for that model</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-starts-selling-its-3999-dgx-spark-ai-developer-pc-120034479.html?src=rss]]></description>

A </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://heatinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Instagram-Teen-Accounts-are-Missing-the-Mark.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">recent report</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> from safety advocates at Heat Initiative&nbsp;found that &quot;young teen users today continue to be recommended or exposed to unsafe content and unwanted messages at alarmingly high rates while using Instagram Teen Accounts.&quot; (Meta called the report &quot;</span><a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7212db91-cd64-4c1b-ab0d-1d1c998f089e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=613b40ac-bee4-45cc-924e-3a8ecc2c467e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=time&amp;linkText=deeply+subjective&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RpbWUuY29tLzczMjQ1NDQvaW5zdGFncmFtLXRlZW4tYWNjb3VudHMtZmxhd2VkLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjEzYjQwYWMtYmVlNC00NWNjLTkyNGUtM2E4ZWNjMmM0NjdlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RpbWUuY29tLzczMjQ1NDQvaW5zdGFncmFtLXRlZW4tYWNjb3VudHMtZmxhd2VkLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASvDy50AGr0EUbPATqKJ6NtBHdEYOKwBD54wyMYllaki&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7324544%2Finstagram-teen-accounts-flawed%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:time;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://time.com/7324544/instagram-teen-accounts-flawed/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">deeply subjective</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">.&quot;)&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Now, Meta is locking down teen accounts even more. With the latest changes, teens will no longer be able to follow or see content from accounts that &quot;regularly share age-inappropriate content&quot; or that seem &quot;age-inappropriate&quot; based on their bio or username. Meta says it will also block these accounts from appearing in teens&#39; recommendations or in search results in the app.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Instagram will also block a &quot;a wider range of mature search terms&quot; for teens, including words like &quot;alcohol,” &quot;gore,&quot; and intentional misspellings of these words, which is a common tactic to avoid Instagram&#39;s filters. And, even if an account a teen already follows shares a post that goes against these rules, teens should be prevented from seeing it, even if it&#39;s sent to their DMs.</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/image005.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/image005.jpg" style="height:1393px;width:1600px;" alt="Instagram will block teens from searching for more term associated with inappropriate content,." data-uuid="2bd03d10-4f56-4600-b079-898c6982cdee"><figcaption>Instagram will block teens from searching for more term associated with inappropriate content,.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">While these changes may seem like Meta once again filling somewhat obvious gaps in its safety features, the company says the revamp is meant to make the content teens encounter on Instagram more like a PG-13 movie. &quot;Just like you might see some suggestive content or hear some strong language in a PG-13 movie, teens may occasionally see something like that on Instagram - but we’re going to keep doing all we can to keep those instances as rare as possible,&quot; the company explained in a blog post.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">That&#39;s a somewhat confusing analogy as there&#39;s a fairly wide spectrum of what might appear in a PG-13 movie. Meta also says that some of its rules for teens are <em>more</em> restrictive than what teens might see in a PG-13 movie. For example, the app aims to prevent teens from seeing any kind of &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; content or images of &quot;near nudity&quot; even though that type of content might appear in movies rated for 13-year-olds.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">For parents that want even tighter restrictions, Instagram is also adding a new &quot;limited content&quot; setting that filters &quot;even more&quot; content from teens&#39; view (Meta didn&#39;t explain what exactly would be restricted). The setting also prevents teens from accessing any comments on the platform, either on their own posts or other users&#39;. Finally, Meta is testing a new reporting feature for parents that use Instagram&#39;s parental control settings to monitor their teens&#39; use of the app. With the feature, parents can flag specific posts they feel are inappropriate to trigger a review by Meta.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Meta says the latest changes will be rolling out &quot;gradually&quot; to teen accounts in the US, UK, Canada and Australia to start and that it will eventually &quot;add additional age-appropriate content protections for teens on Facebook.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-makes-teen-accounts-more-restrictive-120000653.html?src=rss]]></description>

If your machine still uses it, rest assured it’ll continue to work, but you won’t see any more software and security updates. If your machine is compatible, you’ll be able to upgrade to Windows 11 for free, or this can provide the justification you need to buy a new machine.</p>
<p>But there’s also a way to keep your status quo without the additional stress, at least for the next year. It’s possible to sign up to Microsoft’s Extended Security updates program, giving you an extra year of software and security patches. It won’t cost you any money, but you will be expected to sign up to Microsoft’s cloud services.</p>

It follows a complaint from those poor carriers that believe it’s far too hard to be required to tell customers what it is they’re charging for. I bet that’s loads of fun for all of the FCC employees who went into public service in the hope of actually serving the public.</p>

<p>Apple is dropping <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-is-now-just-apple-tv-200644609.html">the + from the name of its TV subscription service. That’s a smart piece of branding, since everyone just calls it Apple TV anyway</a>. But it does muddy the waters, given Apple’s set top box is also called Apple TV. But, as someone who reviews Apple TV shows and irritates editors by forgetting the plus sign, this will make my (and their) lives a lot easier.</p>

If so, it would be mirroring the release pattern from last year, when an updated product was launched online each day across a week. Rumors suggest we’ll only get the vanilla A5 versions this fall, with the higher-end versions of the silicon not arriving until the start of next year.</p>

Historically, we’ve seen new Mac hardware in October and then again in spring. But as of right now, there are just two MacBooks in Apple’s lineup: MacBook Air models with the M4 chip and MacBook Pro models with the M4 chip. Within those two options lie a handful of choices, including chip type, screen size, storage capacity and more. This guide will help you suss out the Apple terminology and explain the options so you can pick the best MacBook configuration for your needs.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-budget-macbooks">What about budget MacBooks?</h2> 
<p>Historically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Now, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&amp;H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.</p> 
<p>Of course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">decent PCs for under $500</a>. If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a6dcab25-0d73-4da2-98ba-8a4bd8cb864d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=refurbished+options+directly+from+Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9yZWZ1cmJpc2hlZC9tYWMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2ZGNhYjI1LTBkNzMtNGRhMi05OGJhLThhNGJkOGNiODY0ZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQvbWFjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfCgP8G9TK47ylIkIX9-dZCqtvqfvfF5HSRhj5hhY8X0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac">refurbished options directly from Apple</a>, or even third party sellers like BackMarket. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/where-to-buy-refurbished-tech-140028700.html">over in our refurbished guide</a>, but mainly, you’ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-macbook">Factors to consider when buying a MacBook</h2> 
<p>Compared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">M1</a> chip, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html">used Intel chips</a> in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-chips-pro-max-003004080.html">M3</a> generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-new-mac-studio-comes-with-the-long-awaited-m3-ultra-chip-140005216.html">M3 series</a> in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.</p> 
<p>While a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-cores"><strong>CPU cores</strong></h3> 
<p>The lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-report-reveals-details-on-the-three-m3-chips-apple-may-launch-monday-night-202456989.html">M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max</a> chips). The burliest chip, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-unveils-its-top-of-the-line-m4-max-chip-150241987.html">M4 Max</a> is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-ram"><strong>RAM</strong></h3> 
<p>Your options for RAM, or in Apple’s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That’s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-imac-gets-an-m4-refresh-for-faster-apple-intelligence-151251449.html">Apple Intelligence</a> (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM.</p> 
<p>You’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.</p> 
<p>In addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use.</p> 
<p>For a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-storage-capacity-ssd"><strong>Storage capacity (SSD)</strong></h3> 
<p>Storage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.</p> 
<p>When Apple announced the <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-first-impressions-lights-camera-action-button-200647981.html">iPhone 15</a>, the company also announced new iCloud+ <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/icloud-adds-new-6tb-and-12tb-storage-tiers-194853580.html">storage storage plans</a>, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-screen-size"><strong>Screen size</strong></h3> 
<p>The MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html">reviewed</a> the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen "makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.</p> 
<p>But screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.</p> 
<p>All MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (<a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html">in-plane switching</a>, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).</p> 
<p>You also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.</p> 
<p>Compared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-systems"><strong>Operating systems</strong></h3> 
<p>Software considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html">if you’re switching</a> from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/metal-4-for-macos-tahoe-26-introduces-new-gaming-features-like-frame-interpolation-183247623.html">better graphics</a> coming to Macs.</p> 
<p>As for macOS, it’s getting better too. With <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html">macOS Tahoe 26</a>, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design</a> for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price"><strong>Price</strong></h3> 
<p>When Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-macbook-air-and-pro"><strong>What's the difference between MacBook Air and Pro?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MBP models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ofcom has slapped 4chan <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/investigation-into-4chan-and-its-compliance-with-duties-to-protect-its-users-from-illegal-content?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Ofcom%20issues%20update%20on%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20investigations&amp;utm_content=Ofcom%20issues%20update%20on%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20investigations+Preview+CID_cce26a99ffb44cf297b26df45f295852">with a £20,000</a> ($26,700) fine for failing to comply with the internet and telecommunications regulator&#39;s request for information under the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-internet-watchdog-gives-social-media-companies-three-months-to-improve-safety-or-face-huge-fines-130018908.html">UK&#39;s Online Safety Act of 2023</a>. The regulator has released an update for 11 of the investigations it opened after the first of its online safety codes became enforceable in March this year. Apparently, 4chan has ignored its requests for a copy of its illegal harms risk assessment and to provide information about its qualifying worldwide revenue. This is the first fine Ofcom has handed down under the new law, which was designed to prevent children from accessing harmful content online and which has prompted websites like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-begins-age-verification-checks-for-uk-users-134516723.html">Reddit</a> and X to put up age verification measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the regulator launch its probe into 4chan in June, it said it received complaints about illegal content on the anonymous online board. It doesn&#39;t exactly come as a surprise that 4chan refuses to give the regulator information about the risks of illegal content on its website: Back in August, the service <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/internet-forum-4chan-sues-uk-regulator-us-over-free-speech-2025-08-28/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Ofcom, arguing that the enforcement of the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act violates Americans&#39; freedom of speech. &quot;This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/britain-issues-first-online-safety-fine-us-website-4chan-2025-10-13/">said</a> Liz Kendall, the UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology. The regulator is also imposing an additional penalty of £100 ($133) per day on 4chan until it complies with its requests for information.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ofcom has announced the results of other investigations, as well, such as finding &quot;serious compliance concerns&quot; with two file-sharing services that have now deployed an automated tool that can detect and quickly remove uploads with child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Four other file-sharing services that were also under investigation for CSAM chose to geoblock access from UK IP addresses instead, so the regulator closed their cases.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/uk-regulator-fines-4chan-for-ignoring-online-safety-act-demands-045026169.html?src=rss]]></description>

Going forward, it will group any text ads on the Search page into a &quot;Sponsored results&quot; section that will appear at the top of the screen.

Its theme is &quot;infinity&quot; and the project is slated for a 2026 release with a DLC planned for 2027. The datamine also revealed that an early build of the game treated the central area as an MMO-style lobby, where players could see and interact with each other as well as access quest boards. <em>Wind and Waves</em> could also have an MMO raid boss and may give players the ability to explore underwater.&nbsp;A bunch of other </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">details</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> about the plot, characters and mechanics may have been uncovered in the leak.</span></p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokémon Project Seed is not only the dream multi-region Pokémon game that people have always asked for, it also appears to be an MMO.<br><br>&quot;Seed is a prototyping project for a next-generation online game playable by multiple people, set in a region that connects Hoenn and Sinnoh&quot; <a href="https://t.co/JPN5tAJfr5">https://t.co/JPN5tAJfr5</a></p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977803554770604239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Other Pokémon projects reportedly in the works at Game Freak include another new Pokémon Legends game set in Galar that&#39;s slated for 2027 and beyond. A multi-region Pokémon remake, internally called Project Seed, may be released in 2028. The datamined leaks suggest this game also seems to be exploring some online multiplayer mechanics as well as letting players walk freely between different regions from past titles, which sure sounds like it could be a full-on Pokémon MMO.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">It’s been an interesting few months in the realm of streaming service branding. Warner Bros. Discovery <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-is-back-hbo-max-says-121537812.html" data-i13n="slk:reverted Max back to HBO Max;cpos:1;pos:1">reverted Max back to HBO Max</a> after a baffling decision to trim the name in the first place. Disney made Hulu the &quot;global general entertainment brand&quot; on Disney+ when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-design-and-navigation-changes-are-on-the-way-165513106.html" data-i13n="slk:rebranded the Star hub;cpos:2;pos:1">rebranded the Star hub</a> on the service. Now Apple would like you to know that it’s changing the name of its streaming service too. Going forward, Apple TV+ is now just Apple TV.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The company revealed the news in very lowkey fashion, at the end of <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=af796d9d-0954-4ca0-99ba-3ebaa3c5e7f5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=a+press+release&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAd_M-Etqyr-VUEbj1x9Tqd0HncBWZf_2ks_Uc_fDZlxX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2025%2F10%2Fapple-original-films-blockbuster-feature-f1-the-movie-from-joseph-kosinski-to-make-global-streaming-debut-on-friday-december-12-2025%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;slk:a press release;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/10/apple-original-films-blockbuster-feature-f1-the-movie-from-joseph-kosinski-to-make-global-streaming-debut-on-friday-december-12-2025/">a press release</a> about when its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/f1-the-movie-review-a-shameless-apple-ad-that-will-blow-your-socks-off-144808364.html" data-i13n="slk:F1 movie;cpos:4;pos:1"><em>F1</em> movie</a> will land on Apple TV, the streaming service with a monthly subscription (December 12, FYI). “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity,” the company said without elaborating.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Apple does like to keep things clean, and shearing off the plus sign is one way of doing that. But oversimplification can cause greater confusion. </p><p style="text-align:left;">As Apple states in its own press release, “Apple TV is available on the Apple TV app” and “For a limited time, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac can enjoy three months of Apple TV for free.” Did no one at Apple’s (generally very effective) marketing team spot the problem with this? Buying Apple TV to get free Apple TV sounds like a recursive capitalist fever dream that will never end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As it stands, you can turn on your Apple TV device to open the Apple TV app to watch Apple TV. There are lots of things in the Apple TV app that aren’t actually Apple TV shows or movies and you may have to pay for those separately. The press release also states that you can watch <em>F1 </em>right now if you buy it on Apple TV through the Apple TV app, so you don’t have to wait for the film to make its “global streaming debut” on Apple TV. What a mess.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Apple hasn’t fully rolled out the change yet, as there are still plenty of references to “Apple TV+” on the streaming service’s website. It’s still referred to as Apple TV+ on the TV app’s listing on the App Store too. I’m interested to see how confusing things really get if, in the coming months, Apple reveals a refreshed Apple TV. You know, that device you can use to watch Apple TV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-is-now-just-apple-tv-200644609.html?src=rss]]></description>
