                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has removed dating apps Tea and TeaOnHer from the App Store for violating rules related to content moderation and user privacy. The company told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/apple-confirms-it-pulled-controversial-dating-apps-tea-and-teaonher-from-the-app-store/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em> </em>that it pulled the apps as they broke several of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">rules</a>, including one mandating that apps can&#39;t share or otherwise use an individual&#39;s personal info without getting their permission first.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple said they also violated a rule concerning user-generated content, which stipulates that apps need to allow for reporting offensive or concerning material, an option to block abusive users and the ability to filter &quot;objectionable material from being posted.&quot;  In addition, Apple claimed the apps broke rules related to user reviews. It told <em>TechCrunch</em> they had an &quot;excessive&quot; volume of negative reviews and complaints from users, including ones related to minors’ personal details being shared. The company noted that it raised these issues&#39; with the apps&#39; developers, but they were not resolved.</p><p>As it stands, both apps are still available on Android through the Google Play Store. Tea (which is formally called Tea Dating Advice) enables women to post details about men they&#39;ve met or dated. It allows them to post and comment on photos, look up public records on individuals, carry out reverse image searches, share their experiences and rate or review men. Users can, for instance, say whether they&#39;d give a man a &quot;green flag&quot; or a &quot;red flag.&quot;</p><p>TeaOnHer flips that format on its head, with men sharing info about women. Both are pitched as dating safety apps, with Tea telling users they can &quot;ask our anonymous community of women to make sure your date is safe, not a catfish and not in a relationship.&quot;</p><p>Tea first emerged in 2023 and it went viral this year. In July, hackers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/data-breach-at-tea-reportedly-contains-images-and-dms-from-last-week-224823984.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">breached the app</a> and leaked tens of thousands of images, including around 3,000 selfies and photo IDs that users submitted to verify their accounts. The other images included posts, comments and private messages. A second hack exposed more than a million private messages.</p><p>Days after TeaOnHer went live in August (ripping off text from Tea’s App Store description in the process), it emerged that app <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/theres-a-tea-app-for-men-and-it-also-has-security-problems-224435459.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">had its own security issues</a>. It was possible to view photo IDs and selfies that users had submitted for account verification, as well as their email addresses.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-dumps-dating-apps-tea-and-teaonher-from-the-app-store-over-privacy-and-moderation-issues-191305457.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is adding a timer to Shorts to help curb all of that incessant doomscrolling, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/youtube-adds-at-timer-for-you-to-stop-scrolling-shorts/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. This feature is rolling out to all users after being spotted in an Android APK file earlier this year, which was originally <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-shorts-daily-timer-3543839/"><ins>reported on by </ins><em><ins>Android Authorit</ins></em><ins>y</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works. Users set a daily time limit for Shorts via the app&#39;s settings. Once reached, they&#39;ll see a pop-up reminding them to take a break. This pop-up is easily dismissed with a tap, but it&#39;s the thought that counts. At the very least, it&#39;ll remind people of just how long they&#39;ve been laying in bed and watching random <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> clips.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This doesn&#39;t currently integrate with parental controls, but that&#39;s coming next year. At that point, parents or guardians will be able to set specific time limits on how long kids can scroll the Shorts feed. That pop-up will not be dismissible by children.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the first move by YouTube to help improve digital well-being. There&#39;s a way to set &quot;take a break&quot; reminders at various increments, and the same goes for a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-bedtime-reminder-digital-wellness-160010856.html"><ins>pop-up at bedtime</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Why the renewed focus on limiting user engagement? Well, there are nearly 2,000 lawsuits floating around right now directed toward social media companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/new-york-city-sues-social-media-giants-over-addictive-features"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg Law</ins></em></a>. Many of these suits accuse the companies of intentionally designing their platforms to be addictive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/youtube-is-adding-a-timer-to-shorts-so-you-dont-scroll-the-day-away-185204383.html?src=rss]]></description>

Google believes its new algorithm is further proof of that assumption. The Quantum Echoes algorithm is able to illustrate how different parts of a quantum system interact with each other, in a way that&#39;s repeatable by other quantum computers and that &quot;runs 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;echo&quot; in Quantum Echoes comes from how Google&#39;s algorithm interacts with a quantum system, in this case the Willow chip. &quot;We send a carefully crafted signal into our quantum system (qubits on Willow chip), perturb one qubit, then precisely reverse the signal’s evolution to listen for the &#39;echo&#39; that comes back,&quot; the company explained in its announcement blog. That echo is magnified by the &quot;constructive interference&quot; of quantum waves, making the measurement Google is able to take extremely sensitive.</p><p>That sensitivity suggests quantum computers could be an important tool in modeling things like the interaction of particles or the structure of molecules. In a separate experiment with the University of California, Berkeley, Google tried to prove that by running the Quantum Echoes algorithm to study two different molecules, and comparing it to the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) method currently used by scientists to understand chemical structure. The results from both systems matched, and Google says Quantum Echoes even &quot;revealed information not usually available from NMR.&quot;</p><p>In the longterm, a full-scale quantum computer could be used for everything from drug discovery to the development of new battery components. For now though, Google believes its Quantum Echoes research means real-world quantum computer applications could arrive within the next five years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/google-says-it-made-a-breakthrough-toward-practical-quantum-computing-183502245.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Gemini <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2025/oct/1022-UM-GM-eyes-off-driving-conversational-AI-unified-software-platform.html">is coming to GM vehicles</a> in 2026. The company will be integrating a conversational AI assistant powered by Google&#39;s platform into many of its cars, trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>GM says this assistant will be able to access vehicle data to suss out maintenance concerns, alerting the driver when necessary. The company also promises it&#39;ll be able to help plan routes and explain various features of the car. It should also be able to do stuff like turn on the heat or air conditioning, even before entering the vehicle.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This will replace the &quot;Google built-in&quot; operating system that already exists in many GM vehicles. This OS already offers access to stuff like Google Maps, Google Assistant and related apps. The upcoming Gemini-based chat assistant will do the same type of things, but it should perform better.</p>
<p>“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if you’ve used the, you’ve probably also been frustrated by them because they’re trained on certain code words or they don’t understand accents very well or if you don’t say it quite right, you don’t get the right response,” GM VP <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/gm-is-bringing-google-gemini-powered-ai-assistant-to-cars-in-2026/">Dave Richardson told <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. “What’s great about large language models is they don’t seem to be affected by that.&quot;</p>
<p>One brand-new feature that Gemini will bring to the table is web integration. This will let drivers ask the chatbot questions pertaining to geographic location and the like. GM gives an example of someone asking about the history of a bridge they are passing over.</p>
<p>The Gemini assistant will be available via the Play Store after launch as an over-the-air upgrade to Onstar-equipped vehicles. It won&#39;t be limited to newer releases, as GM says it&#39;ll work with vehicles from the model year 2015 and above. The company also says it&#39;s working on its own AI chatbot that has been &quot;custom-built for your vehicle.&quot; There&#39;s no timetable on that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GM ran into hot water recently when it was found that it had been selling some customer information sourced from its OnStar Smart Driver program to insurance companies <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/ftc-bans-general-motors-from-selling-driver-data-for-five-years-000019615.html">without user consent</a>. This led to the FTC banning the company from selling any driver data for five years. Richardson says the Gemini integration will be privacy-focused and the software will let drivers control what information it can access and use.</p>

But while we strongly recommend using a VPN, it pays to do some research before investing in one — pricing can be opaque for these services, and you can't always trust how the providers portray their best deals. Even so, there are genuinely great deals to be had.</p>
<p>VPN providers love to give out deep discounts to anybody willing to sign up for a year or more at once. This means you've got to pay out more upfront, but if you divide the cost by the months of service, you're actually paying less per month over time. With deals like this, VPN providers boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the previous tier. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

Now, Also is showing off its first products: a lineup of e-bikes and two pedal-assisted electric quads.&nbsp;</p><p>The TM-B e-bike is Also&#39;s attempt at a do-it-all e-bike that can adapt to different use cases whether that&#39;s daily commuting, trail riding or kid and cargo-hauling. It sports a modular frame that can also accommodate a bench seat or rear cargo rack that supports up to 35KG of weight. It only comes in one frame size, but Also says it should be able to adapt to &quot;multiple body sizes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The removable USB-C battery comes in two sizes: standard, which can power up to 60 miles of riding, and large, which maxes out at 100 miles of range. In terms of power, the TM-B’s throttletops out at 20MPH. Also is taking an interesting approach to its drive system, with a setup it&#39;s labeled &quot;DreamRide.&quot; Instead of a mechanical connection between the bike&#39;s rear wheel and the pedals, the TM-B uses &quot;software-defined pedaling,&quot; which will make the riding experience more customizable, according to Also.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/20250918_BrysonMalone_Also_2514.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/20250918_BrysonMalone_Also_2514.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The Also app and Portal display." data-uuid="71f37fbb-6ec3-4873-b4a7-6e7ddecde33a"><figcaption>The Also app and Portal display.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Also</div></figure><p>Given the bike&#39;s roots at Rivian, it&#39;s not surprising that there are also a bunch of other tech-enabled features, including a 5-inch touchscreen display, called &quot;Portal,&quot; that supports navigation, music playback and calling features via an accompanying app. There’s also a built-in security system that automatically locks the frame and rear wheel when you walk away.</p><p>Also is selling the TM-B in three configurations. The first to ship next spring will be the $4,500 TM-B Limited Launch Edition, which has a range up to 100 miles, support for standard and sport ride modes and features transparent purple accents. The $4,500 TM-B Performance has the same features as the limited edition model, but has a slightly different color scheme, and will be available within the &quot;first half&quot; of 2026. Finally, there&#39;s a base-level TM-B model with a range of up to 60 miles that only comes with standard ride modes. Also hasn&#39;t announced an exact price, but says it will cost less than $4,000 when it ships &quot;later in 2026.&quot; Pre-orders for the Launch Edition are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ridealso.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">open now</a> and the other two bikes are available to reserve with a $50 deposit.&nbsp;The bikes will also be on display in Rivian showrooms later this year,</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/also_quads.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/also_quads.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="Also&#39;s quad for commercial uses cases (left) and a smaller quad for families (right)." data-uuid="bf90ebc7-67a9-4c94-8151-70798a480994"><figcaption>Also&#39;s quad for commercial uses cases (left) and a smaller quad for families (right).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Also</div></figure><p>The company also previewed two electric, pedal-assisted quads it&#39;s calling TM-Q. The smaller quad is apparently meant for &quot;families and individuals seeking a safe, compact alternative to cars&quot; that can still haul “significant loads.” The larger TM-Q, on the other hand, is meant for commercial deliveries. Also has partnered with Amazon to develop fleets of such vehicles that can be used by delivery drivers. Both quads are intended to be used in bike lanes, according to Also.&nbsp;</p><p>The company didn&#39;t share details about when these vehicles might be available or how much they&#39;ll cost.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-first-e-bike-from-rivian-spinoff-also-has-a-virtual-drivetrain-173000250.html?src=rss]]></description>

And now we also have a release date for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/marvel-cosmic-invasion-is-a-90s-style-beat-em-up-in-the-mold-of-shredders-revenge-191110625.html"><em><ins>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</ins></em></a>.</p>

<p>Out December 1 on practically every platform, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>lets you choose a team of two superheroes from a playable roster of 15, and you can switch character mid-fight. The new release date trailer rounds off the roster with the Invincible Iron Man (heard of him?) and Phoenix/Jean Grey (played by Jennifer Hale, who also voiced Jean in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-men-97-didnt-have-to-go-that-hard-140023964.html"><em><ins>X-Men ‘97</ins></em></a>), who join a list of previously announced characters that includes Spider-Man, Wolverine and Captain America.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With its gorgeous pixel art visuals and obvious &#39;90s-era Marvel comics inspiration, it’s hard to see <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>being anything other than a hit, and it’s fair to say that the license is in very good hands.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/pikmin-4-sprouts-a-free-update-on-nintendo-switch-this-november-adding-decor-pikmin-and-more/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Nintendo</a> has announced a free update for <em>Pikmin 4</em> that could remedy one of fans&#39; biggest complaints about the game. (Yes, free. From Nintendo. We&#39;re shocked too, but we&#39;ll take it.) The update, which arrives in November, adds Fierce mode to make the game more challenging for those who want it. We don&#39;t know exactly what that will look like yet, but a higher difficulty level is a welcome addition to a game that is, for many players including myself, absolutely delightful but much too easy. It may not reach <em>Pikmin 2</em> heights still, but maybe we&#39;ll see enemies respawn?&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>On the opposite end, for players who want to breeze through an even <em>chiller</em> experience than <em>Pikmin 4</em> already offered, the update also brings Relaxed mode, where enemies won&#39;t bother you unless you attack them first. This mode could go hand in hand with another new feature, the Field Camera, which puts a <em>Pokémon-Snap-</em>style spin on things. With this, you&#39;ll be able to take photos of your Pikmin and squad in the wild, and &quot;set the scene with various angles, hide characters, and decorate your pics with filters, frames and stamps.&quot; It might be nice not to have enemies pestering you while you&#39;re just trying to have a photoshoot.&nbsp;</p><p>The update also brings a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pikmin-bloom-has-been-helping-me-meet-my-outdoor-walking-goals-for-years-000025214.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Pikmin Bloom</em></a> staple over to the mainline game: Decor Pikmin. You&#39;ll soon be able to find Pikmin that are decked out in little costumes, and can add these characters to your squad. The announcement hints that snapping a picture of them may be the way to do this. And, <em>Pikmin Bloom</em> players will be able to send these special Decor Pikmin to the app to join their squad over there too. There&#39;s more news for <em>Pikmin Bloom</em> players as well. The mobile game is finally getting Ice Pikmin on November 1. These will sprout from new blue seedlings that will be found, to start, at Restaurant and Roadside locations.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/icepik.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/icepik.jpg" style="height:1552px;width:2788px;" alt="An Ice Pikmin with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on its head and a pink spoon sticking out sits on a rocky ledge" data-uuid="491d61b3-b9cd-4926-b3b3-7f0b4c3e1f40"><figcaption>An Ice Pikmin with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on its head and a pink spoon sticking out sits on a rocky ledge</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>At the beginning of October, Nintendo got us all worked up about the possibility of new Pikmin content when it dropped an animated short that at first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nintendo-just-released-a-mysterious-animated-short-140749774.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">seemed to be Pikmin related</a>, and was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nintendo-just-released-a-mysterious-animated-short-140749774.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">later confirmed to be</a>. The company eventually put the hype to rest, explaining that the videos were indeed just the first short films from Nintendo Pictures Co., which will &quot;explore new creative possibilities through video content&quot; — not a promotion for a new game, as fans hoped. But with a new reason to dive back into <em>Pikmin 4</em> now on the horizon, maybe all the excitement wasn&#39;t for nothing.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pikmin-4-is-getting-a-free-update-with-hard-mode-decor-pikmin-and-a-camera-to-snap-field-photos-165200723.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/no-mans-sky-finally-has-a-very-positive-rating-on-steam-after-8-years-130033575.html">comeback stories</a> in the history of video games just keeps writing itself new chapters. If you’ve checked in on the wildly ambitious space sim, <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, in the last few years then you’ll know just how much UK-based developer Hello Games has turned things around for a game that was once the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-30-no-mans-sky-steam-asa-investigation.html"><ins>subject</ins></a> of a false advertising investigation. And its latest <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/22/no-mans-skys-all-new-breach-update-live-today/"><ins>update</ins></a> introduces fully explorable space wrecks.</p>
<p>The follow-up to August’s substantial <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/"><ins>Voyagers</ins></a> expansion, the new Breach update adds floating wrecks that you&#39;re invited to salvage to your heart’s content. The materials you find can be used to unlock new ship-building parts, and after Voyagers — which finally allowed players to build their own fully crewed spaceships — was such a hit with the <em>No Man’s Sky </em>audience, Hello Games says it has also improved and expanded its workshop feature in the latest update.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Breach also introduces a new expedition, which are <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s time-limited story-driven events. In this one, players will &quot;traverse a desolate and abandoned universe to discover what happened to a mysterious abandoned wreck.&quot; Those able to successfully voyage to the edge of space and ransack the remains of the ship will be rewarded with rare parts to use on their own creations, including &quot;glowing Atlas-themed wings.&quot; The expedition looks suitably spooky for a Halloween playthrough with your pals.</p>
<p><em>No Man’s Sky </em>celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2026, and the Breach update seemingly rounds off what Hello Games founder Sean Murray <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/"><ins>calls</ins></a> a &quot;crazy year&quot; for his team. It seems unlikely that we won&#39;t get more updates in what will be a landmark year for the game when 2026 rolls around, but Murray also <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/earth-sized-survival-game-light-no-fire-has-real-oceans-to-traverse-needing-large-boats-and-crews-says-hello-games-boss-sean-murray-much-of-the-technology-were-introducing-for-no-mans-sky-is-shared-with-our-next-game/"><ins>appeared to tease</ins></a> the studio’s next project, the open-world survival game <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-makers-of-no-mans-sky-will-simulate-a-whole-planet-for-light-no-fire-035108958.html"><em><ins>Light No Fire</ins></em></a>, when announcing the arrival of the Voyagers expansion back in August. In a message, he seemed to suggest that the ship construction tech introduced in the expansion will also be utilized in <em>Light No Fire</em>, which is currently without a release date.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/no-man-skys-latest-update-let-you-explore-a-space-wreck-164042151.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, we don&#39;t have a timetable for a patch or anything like that. For the time being, some Android users will just have to avoid using the Spotify app while on Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>To that end, error reports have mostly come in from people on Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones. The problem doesn&#39;t appear to be universal, which has led some to speculate that may be related to Chromecast-ready devices. This would explain why the issue only persists on Wi-Fi, but we&#39;ll have to wait to hear from Spotify for a cause.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/spotify-is-freezing-and-crashing-on-some-android-devices-163020556.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use ChatGPT in WhatsApp, it's about time to make other plans. OpenAI said its ubiquitous chatbot will stop working in Meta's ubiquitous chat app on January 15, 2026. According to OpenAI, the change is due to a policy and terms change from WhatsApp.</p>
<p>OpenAI announced the change in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-whatsapp-transition/">blog post</a>. "While we would have much preferred to continue serving you on WhatsApp, we are focused on making the transition as easy for all of our users as possible," the company wrote.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>WhatsApp doesn't support chat exports, and there won't be an automatic way to transfer your chats after the cutoff date. Fortunately, there's a simple workaround to migrate your chat history right now. Under the 1-800-ChatGPT contact profile in WhatsApp, you'll see an option to link your ChatGPT account. Select that, and all your queries on WhatsApp will merge with your ChatGPT history.</p>
<p>As for why this is happening, well, we can only speculate. But the term "turf war" comes to mind. After all, Meta is now <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-invests-148-billion-in-scale-ai-and-recruits-its-ceo-130029612.html">an AI company</a>, too. And 50 million people using another company's chatbot inside WhatsApp must not be good for business. Fortunately, ChatGPT is available on the same platforms as WhatsApp: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and the web.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-in-whatsapp-will-stop-working-in-january-161335173.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Sonic Rumble</em> has a new worldwide launch date: November 5. The game, which we&#39;ve previously <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/segas-next-sonic-game-looks-a-lot-like-fall-guys-124524392.html">likened</a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-fall-guys-level-creator-promises-more-chaos-than-ever-150034998.html"><em>Fall Guys</em></a>, was supposed to come out last winter before its release was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-fall-guys-esque-sonic-rumble-comes-out-on-may-8-145632617.html">rescheduled for May 8</a> this year. By the end of April, however, Sega announced that its global launch had been <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3D27569572-4c53-46e6-b819-5e6ca4f8f8bc">postponed</a> yet again because its developers needed more time to &quot;build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting Sonic game [their] players deserve.&quot; At the time, the company said it had blasted past its goal of 1.4 million <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/">pre-registrations</a> and that it had received &quot;amazing positive response&quot; from players in pre-launch regions. Players who pre-register will receive bonuses when the game launches globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Sonic Rumble</em> is a battle royale-style game that can accommodate up to 32 players at once. Players will race against each other in worlds inspired by the Sonic franchise while collecting Rings they can use to buy new skins and stickers. It has several different modes, including Run wherein players compete for the top spot and Survival wherein they compete to stay in the game. Players can choose between various Sonic characters, including Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Shadow and Dr. Eggman, and form a team of four to race against other teams around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sega developed <em>Sonic Rumble</em> for mobile devices and PC, and it will be available to play on iOS and Android, as well as on Google Play Games on PC and Steam.</p>

<p>After dropping hints for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html">over two years</a>, Samsung, in partnership with Google, finally revealed its first-ever Android extended reality headset Tuesday night. The new device, dubbed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html">Galaxy XR</a>, will run you $1,800 and you can actually <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">buy it today</a>.</p>
<p>Due to its collaboration with Google, it&#39;s not a surprise that the headset comes fully equipped with Gemini AI built in. &quot;Android XR is the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era, and we are incredibly excited to take a significant leap forward today with the launch of Galaxy XR,&quot; Sameer Samat, President of Android Ecosystem at Google, said.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What are the features of the Galaxy XR headset, and how does it differ from its main competitor, the $3,499 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">Apple Vision Pro</a>? Glad you asked!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-the-galaxy-xr">What is the Galaxy XR?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is the first-ever Android XR headset, created by Google and Samsung. If Apple&#39;s Vision Pro is the &quot;virtual reality iPhone,&quot; the Samsung is basically its &quot;virtual reality Galaxy S phone&quot; alternative. The headset looks like a pair of snowboard goggles, but it comes with a whopping total of 12 cameras and six microphones. And because it&#39;s 2025, AI is a big part of the Galaxy XR&#39;s upsell: It has Google&#39;s Gemini AI assistant built in, so while you&#39;re wearing the headset, it can see and hear everything around you.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s &quot;XR&quot; designation stands for &quot;extended reality,&quot; which is effectively an &quot;all of the above&quot; term encompassing augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality.  That means the Galaxy XR can put a virtual overlay on the real world (thanks to all those cameras), or it can completely shut out your space to immerse you in a totally virtual environment. In other words, you can customize your own workspace or turn your room into your own personal theater, or you can transport yourself to an international locale with a first-person &quot;you are there&quot; viewpoint.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-can-you-do-with-the-galaxy-xr"><strong>What can you do with the Galaxy XR?</strong></h2>
<p>For watching videos on apps like YouTube, the headset offers a library of 180- and 360-degree VR content. You can also watch movies using Google TV on a large, resizable screen. Plus, if you have a question about whatever you&#39;re watching, you can ask Gemini since it sees everything you see. And when you&#39;re looking at your photos and videos, you can convert them to 3D so it feels like you&#39;re back in the memory.</p>
<p>While using Google Maps, you can use <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-adding-gemini-ai-powered-tools-to-maps-140045971.html">Immersive View</a> to go anywhere in the world (virtually, of course). Visiting somewhere historical? You can ask Gemini to tell you more information about the landmark. Spot a weird-looking plant or bug around your house? You can use Circle to Search to find out what it is while wearing the headset.</p>

<p>As for getting work done efficiently, you can arrange your most-needed apps all around your screen — for instance, your web browser, favorite music app, important documents and video conferencing app. And if things start to feel cluttered, you can ask Gemini to organize your windows. Even better, you can link your PC to your headset, as well as your keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>The headset uses two passthrough cameras for real-time viewing, six world-facing tracking cameras and four eye-tracking cameras, as well as depth and flicker sensors. It also supports iris recognition so you can unlock the device and enter passwords within some apps.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-apps-work-on-the-galaxy-xr">What apps work on the Galaxy XR?</h2>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/why-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-can-support-almost-all-android-apps-021000889.html">&quot;Almost all&quot; Google Play Store apps</a> will be available on the Galaxy XR headset. That means hundreds of thousands of apps should be available on the headset on day one, including basic streaming apps (for watching things like Netflix, HBO Max or Peacock on that giant virtual display) as well as &quot;new versions&quot; of some of Google&#39;s key first-party software, from Photos to Chrome and YouTube. And, of course, the aforementioned Google Maps is on board, too.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/ea526da0-aef0-11f0-9f79-70d997379a5f" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/ea526da0-aef0-11f0-9f79-70d997379a5f" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Using the Galaxy XR as a PC monitor, you can stream in a game -- such as this " data-uuid="0a4ff9c2-bda6-3004-b57f-a14bbb3a6896"><figcaption>Using the Galaxy XR as a PC monitor, you can stream in a game -- such as this &quot;Assassin&#39;s Creed&quot; tile -- from an external source. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure>
<p>As you&#39;d expect, Google is also focusing on gaming. In addition to the full panoply of Android games, the Galaxy XR&#39;s PC Link also lets you use it as a monitor for PC-based games, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engadget&#39;s Sam Rutherford got some <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-a-smarter-more-open-take-on-apples-vision-pro-for-half-the-price-020044642.html">hands-on time with the Galaxy XR</a> recently, and had some notable first impressions on its comfort and usability:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t seems Samsung learned a lot from its rivals by including a much larger and thicker head cushion that helps distribute the weight of the headset more evenly. Granted, during a longer session, I still noticed a bit of pressure and felt relief after taking off the Galaxy XR, but it&#39;s nothing like the Vision Pro, which in my experience gets uncomfortable almost immediately. Finally, around back, there&#39;s a simple strap with a knob that you can twist to tighten or loosen the headband as necessary. So even without extra support running across the top of your head, getting in and out of the Galaxy XR is much easier and comfier than the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-is-the-galaxy-xr-different-from-the-apple-vision-pro">How is the Galaxy XR different from the Apple Vision Pro?</h2>
<p>While the headset may look pretty similar to the Apple Vision Pro, there are some bigger (and even better) differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, the Galaxy&#39;s micro-OLED display has 29 million pixels, compared to Apple&#39;s 23 million pixels, and a resolution of 3,552 x 3,840, which offers a tad more detail than Apple&#39;s model. Additionally, it has 96% of the DCI‑P3 color gamut, while the Vision Pro has 92%. However, Apple&#39;s headset beats out the Samsung on refresh rate, going a full 120Hz versus the Galaxy XR&#39;s 90Hz.</p>
<p>Since you&#39;ll be wearing it on your head for an extended period, you&#39;ll be relieved to know the Galaxy XR is a bit lighter than Apple&#39;s XR headset by 205g (0.5lbs).</p>
<p>On the battery life front, Samsung is pledging up to two hours of &quot;general use&quot; and 2.5 hours of video playback, whereas the new M5 Vision Pro runs 30 minutes longer in both modes, per Apple.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious operating system differences, of course, the aforementioned price delta is perhaps the biggest advantage Samsung has over the Apple model: At $1,800, you can get almost two full Galaxy XR units for every $3,499 Apple Vision Pro.</p>

<p>You can <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-order-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-020008173.html">order the Galaxy XR</a> now via <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung</a>. While that $1,800 price tag is formidable, Samsung is offering financing options. And the headset&#39;s price is actually less than that of Samsung&#39;s flagship <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> foldable phone. Key accessories like the Travel Case and Galaxy XR Controller usually cost $250 each, though both can be bundled in for $175 apiece.</p>
<p>There are additional incentives, too. For anyone buying the Galaxy XR before the end of the year, Samsung is throwing in the &quot;Explorer Pack&quot; at no extra charge. That includes a year&#39;s worth of Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium (including YouTube Music) and Google Play Pass; access to the new season of NBA League Pass; and access to the <em>NFL Pro Era</em> game, the Asteroid and Calm apps and Adobe&#39;s Project Pulsar, a 3D compositing app.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update, 11:58AM ET:</em></strong><em> Upon original publication, one instance of the price listed in this story was inaccurate because of a typo. It now correctly reflects the $1,800 price. </em></p>

<p>The 10,000mAh battery should charge a modern iPhone nearly two times before requiring a trip to the outlet. For those not keen on wireless charging, there's a USB-C port.</p>

Remedy cofounder Markus Mäki is taking over on an interim basis (and stepping down as chairman of the board) while the company looks for a permanent CEO. Henri Österlund, a board member since 2017, is Remedy’s new chairman.</p><p>“I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016,&quot; Mäki said in a statement. &quot;I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.&quot; Virtala will remain at Remedy for a transition period to help with the handover of CEO duties.</p><p>Remedy didn&#39;t spell out the reasons as to why Virtala is leaving as CEO, but said it was by mutual consent. However, it&#39;s been a rough year for Remedy after its latest game, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, failed to meet sales expectations.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Uber Green is rebranding to Uber Electric, and to coincide with the name switch — a move designed to make it clearer for Uber users preferring to hail zero-emissions rides — the company will incentivise its drivers to swap their current vehicle for an EV by way of a $4,000 grant. According to Uber’s numbers, there are currently more than 200,000 EVs on its global network, and drivers are switching to electric up to 5x faster than regular motorists in the US, Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>Uber’s carrot for drivers is particularly timely given that President Trump’s &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-a-middle-finger-to-us-solar-energy-152042835.html"><ins>Big, Beautiful Bill</ins></a><ins>&quot;</ins> recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html"><ins>wiped out</ins></a> the federal tax credit on used EVs, which was worth (at its maximum value) the same amount as its new &quot;Go Electric&quot; EV grant. The grant automatically qualifies drivers in New York City, California, Colorado, and Massachusetts to receive $4,000 when they switch to an EV. Grants are available for both new and used electric vehicles, and Uber drivers nationwide can also get $1,000 when they purchase any new or used EV through TrueCar.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Uber has also announced that it&#39;s rolling out its battery-aware matching (BAM) feature to EVs made by Kia, Hyundai, Ford, Nissan, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz in 25 countries including the US and Canada. This allows drivers to connect their vehicle to the Driver app, and will subsequently only receive ride requests that they are able to fulfill with their remaining range at the time. Uber said that 49 percent of non-EV drivers on its platform are put off switching to an EV due to battery-related concerns, which the expansion of BAM should help alleviate.</p>
<p>The Uber Electric rebrand follows Uber transitioning Uber Green to fully electric in the US earlier this year, where previously it has consisted of a mix of hybrids and all-electric vehicles. Riders are also being enticed to seek EV drivers, with Uber offering them 20 percent off (up to $8) their next electric ride with code GOELECTRIC20, which is valid for a week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/uber-will-pay-drivers-4000-to-switch-to-an-ev-144704532.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If I had a dollar for every time a vehicle manufacturer launched a new in-car software experience designed to achieve the same levels of user experience as your average tablet or smartphone, I&#39;d probably have about enough cash for a decent lunch at a middling restaurant. It&#39;s a common refrain, and yet after years of hearing that same story over and over, I still find myself firing up Android Auto or Apple CarPlay as soon as I get into just about every new car I evaluate.&nbsp;</p><p>At the launch of the 2026 Toyota RAV4, I heard that story yet again, about how they&#39;d rewritten their in-car software to deliver an experience like that found in modern mobile devices. And I have to say, for once, they might have actually delivered. Toyota&#39;s latest SUV has voice and touch capabilities that are not only quick and responsive but genuinely pleasant to use. And thankfully, the rest of the SUV has been upgraded to match.</p><p>The RAV4 has been in production for over 30 years now. This, the sixth generation, comes hot on the heels of its predecessor becoming the world&#39;s best-selling car in 2024. Over 1.1 million were sold last year, which goes a long way towards explaining why you can&#39;t kick a pebble in a grocery store parking lot without hitting a RAV4.</p><p>The overall changes for the 2026 RAV4 aren&#39;t radical, but they are appreciated. For starters, every trim of this SUV is a hybrid, with base models powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that drives the front wheels, offering 226 horsepower. Those wanting all-wheel drive can add another electric motor at the back, adding a little more power (10 hp) and a good bit more drive for low-grip situations.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/2026_Toyota_RAV4_first_drive_033.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/2026_Toyota_RAV4_first_drive_033.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="For 2026, every trim of the RAV4 is a hybrid. " data-uuid="53a6f630-442e-4656-9571-fa0db62bb4f7"><figcaption>For 2026, every trim of the RAV4 is a hybrid. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>From there, buyers can step up to a revised plug-in hybrid model, which now makes 324 horsepower, up 22 from before. Fuel economy is up too, up to 48 mpg depending on what trim you choose, and you can now get up to 52 miles of range from a 22.7 kWh battery pack in the plug-in.</p><p>And that&#39;s usable range. I took a RAV4 XSE plug-in edition out for a morning drive and covered nearly 20 miles without spinning up the engine. Even at highway speeds the RAV4 was slow but perfectly manageable. With that much range and even reasonably quick DC charging (50 kW maximum), it&#39;s easy to see this as the introduction to EVs for many.</p><p>For better or worse, that DC charging is handled on a CCS port, not the newer NACS ports that most manufacturers (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyota-is-bringing-the-c-hr-back-to-the-us-as-an-all-electric-crossover-170728601.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">even Toyota</a>) are using on their EVs. The lack of any kind of vehicle-to-load functionality is a bummer, too, especially on the rugged-ish Wilderness edition, which would seemingly be a perfect machine for powering a campsite.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of which trim you go with, you&#39;ll get that new software system running on either a 10.5-inch touchscreen on the lower trims or a 12.9-inch display on higher-end machines. The overall experience is the same, looking bright and crisp either way, just with more finger-friendly controls on the bigger panel.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/2026_Toyota_RAV4_first_drive_036.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/2026_Toyota_RAV4_first_drive_036.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Toyota&#39;s revamped software is quick and responsive, especially the voice assistant. " data-uuid="28cc2601-1b2b-4ebb-a108-66088f30ecdf"><figcaption>Toyota&#39;s revamped software is quick and responsive, especially the voice assistant. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>Toyota&#39;s software layout is familiar, with a vertical column of icons on the left for toggling between major sections like media or navigation, and then a row of controls along the bottom for controlling the car&#39;s heating, ventilation and cooling system. The rest of the display is taken up by a customizable series of panels. As you swipe from left to right, you swing through different pages, which you can move around and rearrange as you like. None of this is particularly revolutionary, but is pleasantly responsive. Swiping from page to page was quick and easy, without any annoying lag waiting for content to load.</p><p>That responsiveness continued through to the voice assistant, which is the quickest I&#39;ve ever used in a car. Just say &quot;Hey, Toyota&quot; and ask for whatever you want. When asked for pizza, the voice assistant listed nearby joints, even quoted their star rating and offered navigation, all without the annoying round-trip processing lag that&#39;s common in these systems. Some of that speed might be thanks to the addition of 5G connectivity (provided by AT&amp;T), but there&#39;s surely some quicker hardware running beneath the skin powering the Linux-based software.</p><p>The car&#39;s integrated navigation was also easy to use, quick to route and re-route and features all the points of interest you could ever want. There&#39;s even an integrated dashcam feature that will record any incidents on the road, or whatever else you feel like highlighting, while also storing the footage from the SUV&#39;s other cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the quality experience through the touchscreen, Toyota didn&#39;t take this as an opportunity to delete all the car&#39;s buttons. You&#39;ll still find physical controls for all the major features, including (praise be) a volume knob. It was all good enough to make me not feel compelled to reach for my phone, but of course, I did in the interest of testing. Both wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are supported, not only in the main touchscreen but also able to feed navigation details into the 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. That, too, is customizable, with a series of panels of information that hover over your phone&#39;s map view.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/2026_Toyota_RAV4_first_drive_059.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/2026_Toyota_RAV4_first_drive_059.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="The meaner, sportier GR Sport edition. " data-uuid="d729457a-ceb3-4d99-b0ff-d89e2e0ecf81"><figcaption>The meaner, sportier GR Sport edition. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>So, even if you still prefer your phone, you&#39;re covered, and powered, too. The RAV4 has a pair of Qi wireless chargers, conveniently situated in the center stack just below the HVAC controls. You&#39;ll also find two 45-watt USB-C ports up front, plus a pair of 15-watt ports in the back for rear-seat passengers.</p><p>The new RAV4 has&nbsp; a roomy, comfortable cabin with some fun touches, like a neoprene-like insert in the dash that&#39;s pleasant to touch. The overall interior design won&#39;t win any awards for dramatic styling or eye-catching flair, but it&#39;s comfortable and seems like the kind of thing that&#39;ll stand up to whatever you or your kids throw at it.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of driving dynamics, the extra power offered by the RAV4 doesn&#39;t turn it into a rocket ship, but the PHEV trim in particular feels more than quick enough. There&#39;s also a new GR Sport edition for those who aspire to something even more engaging, but despite a more aggressive grille up front and a big wing hanging off the back, it still feels like a RAV4 from behind the wheel. That is to say: It’s not the most exciting thing on the road.</p><p>But people don&#39;t buy RAV4s to be wowed, they buy them because they&#39;re practical and comfortable and priced right. Price, unfortunately, is one thing we don&#39;t know about the new model, with Toyota only saying that it&#39;ll start somewhere in the low $30,000 range. But all the SUV&#39;s other virtues carry forward into 2026 with upgrades. Add to that a massively improved software experience, and you have an SUV that doesn&#39;t disappoint.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyotas-new-all-hybrid-rav4-has-software-you-might-actually-want-to-use-140000442.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll be able to play the first game in the <em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion</em> series on the Nintendo Switch 2 starting on October 30, just in time for Halloween. The gaming company is adding the title to its GameCube library for the Nintendo Switch Online streaming service. Take note that that service&#39;s GameCube titles are <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-play-gamecube-games-141025334.html">exclusively available</a> on the Switch 2 and require a subscription to the $50-a-year Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier. A basic Switch Online subscription with no access to GameCube, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance classics costs $20 a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since both <em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 </em>(HD version) and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-28-luigis-mansion-3-nintendo-switch-review.html"><em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3 </em></a>are compatible with the new console, the whole series is now playable on the Switch 2. Nintendo released the first <em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion</em> in 2001 as a launch title for GameCube. It was also the first title in the Mario franchise for the system. The story revolves around Luigi, who wins a mansion in a contest he never joined and finds out that it&#39;s located in a dark, mysterious forest. Inside, he has to fight and capture ghosts and solve puzzles in order to unlock doors and explore the entirety of the mansion.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion</em> sold 257,000 units in its first week and was the top-selling GameCube launch title. It was remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2018, but if you&#39;re a fan, we&#39;ll bet you would love to be able to play it again on a newer console.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The iPad Pro is about to turn 10, so hopefully you’ll forgive me for pulling out this well-worn Apple truism one more time. No, it’s not Steve Jobs saying “if you see a stylus, they blew it” (a quote continually used out of context.) It’s the tale of how <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-19-ipad-pro-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">since day one</a>, the iPad Pro’s hardware often felt far more powerful and capable than the software it runs. If you recall, iPadOS was initially a scaled-up version of iOS, with most of the limitations inherent in software designed first for a phone. Apps could take great advantage of the larger screen, but working across multiple apps was just nowhere near as simple as doing the same thing on a Mac. Yes, the iPad has always been more portable, and accessories like the Apple Pencil make it better-suited for some tasks than a Mac, but the knock is always that the iPad — even the Pro — isn’t ideal for getting “real work” done.</p><p>The combination of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html" data-i13n="slk:just-launched iPad Pro&#x002019;s M5 processor;cpos:2;pos:1">just-launched iPad Pro’s M5 processor</a> and the massive iPadOS update might finally quiet that debate. Sure, some people will never want to replace their laptop with an iPad, but it’s more feasible than ever thanks to iPadOS 26. It brings a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html" data-i13n="slk:totally revamped windowing and multitasking system;cpos:3;pos:1">totally revamped windowing and multitasking system</a>, a background tasks API that lets you run heavy processes like rendering video while working in other apps, more robust audio input support and a far better Files app, making the iPad Pro closer in its feature set to a Mac than ever before.&nbsp;</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/smxf1wXfbKE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As Apple’s premium tablet enters its second decade, I spoke with the company’s Ted Merendino (from the iPad Product Marketing team) and Ty Jordan (Product Manager for System Experiences) to learn more about the evolution of the iPad Pro and iPadOS.</p><p>Given how many Mac-like features came to iPadOS 26 this year, I was curious to hear how the company approached putting all that Mac DNA into the iPad while still keeping it distinct, as well as the engineering challenges it presented. “One of the things that makes iPad such a unique device is it&#39;s extremely versatile, right?” Jordan said. “You can use it with touch, you can use it with a trackpad or a keyboard or the Apple Pencil, and that&#39;s really powerful. But it also actually makes an extremely challenging engineering and design problem to try and solve when you&#39;re thinking about something like the new windowing experience.”</p><p>Jordan went on to describe a “multi-year effort” to reconfigure the underlying iPadOS architecture. Apple worked to “maintain the immediacy that you&#39;ve come to expect with a touch device, while still allowing users to have this freedom and flexibility to work across so many more windows at once,” he said. From there, the company had to figure out how to bring a bunch of familiar tools from the Mac together and make sure they work across touchscreens, trackpads and keyboards.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/iPadOS26jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/iPadOS26jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="An iPad running multiple windows in iPadOS 26" data-uuid="a4d493e4-ebf6-4124-9d07-a8e3c6326859"><figcaption>An iPad running multiple windows in iPadOS 26</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>Jordan pointed to Expose (a tool in macOS that shows you all your open windows by swiping up on the trackpad with three fingers) as a good example of something they wanted to bring to iPadOS in a way that felt native. “We leveraged the home gesture that people have been familiar with on iPad for a long time,” he said, “so you can easily see a bird&#39;s eye view of all your windows.”</p><p>Swiping up on the iPad’s screen with one finger has brought you home for years, but now swiping up and holding for a second drops you into Expose, the same way it invokes open apps on an iPhone. And you can use the same three-finger swipe up on an iPad with a trackpad as you can on a Mac. “All these pieces have to be reconsidered over and over again in order to make sure that they do feel distinct to iPad,” Jordan said.</p><p>While iPadOS 26 is a major revision that was just released less than a month ago, the iPad Pro M5 is more of an iterative update, at least on the outside. That’s not a big surprise given that the M4 model released in May 2024 was a complete redesign. The iPad Pro M4 is more capable thanks to the big software update, but this year’s M5 update pushes the tablet even further into a world where AI performance is paramount.&nbsp;</p><p>“M5 has a faster Neural Engine, which continues to be the most power efficient location on the chip to run on-device AI,” Merendino said, citing features like Live Text and Subject Lift that have been in iOS and iPadOS for a while now. He also noted that the faster CPU in the M5 has had neural accelerators for a few generations, things that help with low-latency AI tasks like speech recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>But the M5’s redesigned GPU is where the big changes can be found. “Within each GPU core is the new Neural Accelerator that dramatically speeds up GPU-based AI tasks,” Merendino continued. “So if you are segmenting super high-resolution video, this is much, much faster. For on-device image generation, this is much faster.”&nbsp; Benchmarks I took while reviewing the iPad Pro M5 back this up — all the GPU-based measurements showed huge improvements over the M4.</p><p>Merendino noted that Apple invited the developer for image generation app Draw Things into its labs to test the app with the M5’s GPU neural accelerators and it provided about double the performance of the M4 chip and four times the performance of the M1. My testing with Draw Things backed this up. I ran four different image generation prompts on both the M4 and M5 iPad Pro, and the M5 was more than twice as fast. It typically finished the default prompts I tried in the app in about 50 seconds, while the M4 took about 2 minutes and 25 seconds.<strong><em> </em></strong>Other tasks, like large language model token generation, are six times faster on the M5 compared to the (much older) M1.&nbsp;</p><p>Impressive, for sure, but it’s also fair to say that most iPad Pro users are likely not going to be pushing to the edge of the M5’s computational powers. The flip side of this, though, is that the iPad Pro will likely remain fast enough for all but the most demanding tasks for years. Apple knows this, and it’s evident in the way it’s positioning this new iPad Pro — it’s for demanding customers who’ve been using an M1- or M2-powered iPad Pro for years now and are ready for an upgrade.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main hardware differences between the redesigned M4 and M5 iPad Pros and their predecessors is that Apple made the tablet even thinner and lighter than ever, while packing in the company’s latest silicon. It’s a wild engineering feat, one that impressed me from the very first time I picked up the iPad Pro M4 last year. There is one somewhat humorous thing about the iPad Pro, which is that it’s thinner and lighter than the iPad Air — despite the Air name having historically been used for Apple’s most portable products. Just look at the iPhone Air for the latest example.</p><p>That made me ponder if a more “pro” iPad should be a little thicker and heavier to accommodate a bigger battery, like what you’ll find in the MacBook Pro. The iPad Pro’s 10-hour battery life for basic tasks like web browsing and watching video isn’t short, but if you push it harder it’ll drain a lot quicker. Merendino said that the ongoing thought process behind balancing battery life, performance and size comes down to a focus on portability and versatility.</p><p>“One of the things that has defined iPad since the very beginning is portability. For creative pros, the iPad Pro is untethering them from a workstation,” he said. “It&#39;s letting them create and be productive wherever they may be. And what&#39;s unique is that over the years we&#39;ve made iPad more and more portable.” That’s undeniable; the first iPad was about 1.5 pounds with its 9.7-inch screen and the 13-inch iPad Pro is a quarter of a pound lighter. “But we have also made it vastly more powerful,” Merendino continued, “even though it’s a more portable device, a vastly faster device. We have still maintained that all day battery life that we know users depend on.” So while we’re probably not getting an iPad Pro with 15- or 20-hour battery life any time soon, I can respect the trade-off of making the tablet as portable as possible. It’s one of its main differentiating features compared to a Mac, after all.</p><p>A rumor that started making the rounds just after the iPad Pro M5 was released puts the “Mac versus iPad” debate into a new territory, though. A few reliable sources including Mark Gurman at <em>Bloomberg</em> and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo both say that the M6 refresh of the MacBook Pro will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-m6-macbook-pro-generation-will-reportedly-offer-touchscreens-203029809.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">usher in touchscreens</a> for the first time on a Mac. If this happens, it’ll likely upend the debate yet again. But in the same way an iPad doesn’t really replace the Mac, I don’t think a touchscreen MacBook will necessarily be better than an iPad for some things. The iPad is still the most versatile device Apple sells, and the company believes that versatility is something people recognize and want.&nbsp;</p><p>“With the windowing system that we built, it [still] starts with every app being fullscreen,” Jordan says. “And the idea behind that philosophy is making sure you can be the person who has iPad and is just using it on the couch to watch a show, and then can seamlessly transition to being a professional who’s connected to an external display with a Magic Keyboard and a bunch of windows open. And that versatility is really interesting, and I think customers who gravitate towards iPad are looking for that device that can go across those worlds.”</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/after-10-years-the-ipad-pro-has-finally-carved-out-its-own-identity-130108169.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These days, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17s-new-selfie-camera-lets-you-take-group-shots-without-rotating-your-phone-195345475.html">thanks to smartphones</a>, almost everyone has a camera with them and that’s <em>mostly</em> a good thing. At any time, you can capture memories with family and friends, painterly sunsets and crazy spontaneous moments. The problem is most of us have endless bland photos in our camera rolls because we simply don’t know how to take great shots.</p>
<p>When you’re on vacation or gathering with friends and family, a good photo will provide memories you can proudly share and go back to time and again. And if you’re active on social media, they’re crucial. In this article, I’ll show you how to set yourself up for photo success with the optimal settings and simple but effective composition tips from myself and a pro photographer. And if you’re interested in going further, I’ll highlight several third-party apps that provide even greater manual control. Note that this is focused only on taking photos — I’ll cover video in a future article.</p>

<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/88406f00-a94f-11f0-bcd7-5fd7eaf375fe" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/88406f00-a94f-11f0-bcd7-5fd7eaf375fe" style="height:1585px;width:2800px;" alt="Smartphone photography" data-uuid="b2ca03b2-caeb-3aa3-96f5-2c04ff96c1f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rhonda Dent for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Most smartphones have two or more cameras, each with different lenses, sensors and resolution. They’re usually called the wide (or main), telephoto and ultrawide cameras. These work seamlessly together: You can simply pinch to zoom on the viewfinder to fit your subject into the scene and your phone will switch between the lenses automatically.</p>
<p>Most smartphones offer shortcuts on their viewfinders for you to quickly jump between these, and you&#39;ll usually see numbers like 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 5x to denote the levels of zoom. Ideally, you should use each camera at its optimal setting and avoid in-between digital zooms (like 2.7x) that reduce quality.</p>
<p>You should also know which camera is best for a given subject. People shots are best done with the main or telephoto cameras as those focal lengths flatter the subject and reduce distortion. They also allow for naturally blurred backgrounds and “bokeh” that helps your subject stand out. Since it creates weird warping around the edges of photos, the ultrawide camera is best reserved for landscape shots. Lastly, the telephoto lens is best for distant scenes, but avoid the most extreme settings (above 10x on most cameras) as your photos may become blurry or pixelated.</p>
<p>When it comes to your phone’s portrait mode, there are caveats. While it does create a soft blurred background and “bokeh,” it does so using computational tricks. That can create issues like pixelation around your subject or an overly artificial look. To get natural blur, switch to the main or the telephoto camera, increase the zoom level and move farther away from your subject to frame them.</p>
<p>Finally, this should go without saying, but clean your lens. Whenever you set your phone down, the camera can pick up grease or dirt that will ruin your photos. If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, clean it with any soft cotton fabric — just avoid tissue as it’s rougher than it looks and can mar your lens.</p>

<p>One big plus with smartphones over dedicated cameras is that they have bigger, sharper displays. To start, boost your screen brightness when taking photos so you can easily see your subject and compose your shot.</p>
<p>Take a few extra seconds to decide whether to snap a vertical (portrait) or horizontal (landscape) photo, depending on the subject. Get in the habit of holding your phone in a way that keeps your fingers away from the lenses, as that’s another great way to ruin a shot.</p>
<p>Most recent iPhone and Android models automatically focus on a subject quickly and accurately. However, if multiple people are in a shot, the AI may focus on the wrong person, so be sure to tap on the correct one.</p>
<p>Exposure, or the brightness or dimness of a subject, is typically selected automatically by your phone. Most devices will automatically average the levels across multiple faces so all the people in a shot are well-exposed.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/ad198740-a94e-11f0-a2fe-4d6eb2f87f2a" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/ad198740-a94e-11f0-a2fe-4d6eb2f87f2a" style="height:2270px;width:3026px;" alt="Smartphone photography" data-uuid="d1e9bed0-72fe-3431-9c24-f7baf13f3d84"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>One thing that smartphones are nearly as good at as cameras is macro or closeup photography. Most iPhones and Android devices let you focus very close to subjects from the main (1x) or ultra wide (0.5x) cameras. This can help you produce cool shots of insects, leaves, seashells and other things in nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selecting a new subject automatically changes both focus and exposure. If you tap on a dark part of the image, the camera will automatically brighten it and vice versa, but you can manually change that. On iPhones, tap a subject to bring up the sunshine icon, then move the slider to change brightness. You can also open up extra settings with the down arrow on iPhone and then select the +/- symbol. On a Pixel, open the settings (gear) icon, select brightness and move the slider.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you might want to lock the focus and exposure when taking multiple photos of the same scene. That’s done on both iPhone or Android by clicking and holding for a couple of seconds on the desired subject. Then, the exposure and focus will stay locked until you tap again. You may need to enable this feature in your phone’s settings before it can be used.</p>
<p>What about using the flash? It&#39;s best to use it only when you truly don&#39;t have enough light to capture a moment, as it can make shots look overly bright and unnatural. Below is a good example of a shot taken with and without a flash at night when there was barely enough natural light.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/34a7c9c0-a94e-11f0-bfff-a82754646231" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/34a7c9c0-a94e-11f0-bfff-a82754646231" style="height:1367px;width:2800px;" alt="Smartphone photography" data-uuid="c7e91ad6-02b5-3d93-a2c6-ab06a4d239cc"><figcaption>iPhone 16 photo taken with flash (left) and without flash (right)</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Most smartphones let you take photos nearly instantly from the lockscreen so you can easily capture when something unexpected occurs. It’s a good idea to learn how so you can snap a shot without too much delay.</p>
<p>Recent iPhone models have a dedicated camera button on the right side. First, ensure the settings are configured so that you can activate it without unlocking the phone. Then, push the  button once to open the camera app and then again to take a shot (the main 1x camera is selected automatically). On earlier models, simply swipe left from the lockscreen to instantly access the camera. For Pixel and other Android devices, double pressing the power or volume button will usually bring up the camera app from the lockscreen.</p>
<p>Some iPhone and Android phones have a setting that allows you to take RAW photos. That gives you image data straight off the sensor without any sharpening or other adjustments, so it can provide a more natural look. However, editing RAW photos requires practice and the photos take up a lot of extra space on your camera roll.</p>
<p>Most smartphones allow you to tweak settings like saturation, brightness and contrast, but it&#39;s best not to get too in the weeds.  Even the experts, like my pro photographer friend Nathanael Charpentier, stick to the basics, “No complex settings, no artificial portrait mode. I just occasionally adjust the brightness when necessary,” he told me (one exception for him is black &amp; white photos). This then frees him to “focus entirely on what matters to me: composition.”</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-composition">Composition</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/713cbc60-a8b8-11f0-ad7e-c743cc43935d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/713cbc60-a8b8-11f0-ad7e-c743cc43935d" style="height:3024px;width:4032px;" alt="How to improve your smartphone photography " data-uuid="2e1e312a-e1d4-3fbb-9e71-285e59d38753"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathanael Charpentier for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Smartphones don’t have the same quality as dedicated cameras, but that forces you to think about lighting and composition. Pro photographers like Charpentier will tell you that, whether you’re using a phone or $8,000 camera, the most important part of capturing a shot is the framing.</p>
<p>Many photographers use the “rule of thirds.” This stipulates that key elements like people and geographical features should be placed in thirds across a photo because it’s pleasing to the eye. Simply cutting a landscape in half between the sky and the ground should often be avoided to keep the framing interesting.</p>
<p>To help with this, many smartphone cameras include a grid that divides the screen into thirds (turn on the “Grid” setting on iPhone or “Grid Type” on a Pixel device and choose 3x3). When that’s enabled, you can place your primary subject and other elements near where those lines intersect. These grids can also help you keep shots level.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, a symmetric composition is best. If you want to shoot down a dock, for example, you can center it to take advantage of the converging lines. Then, you can slightly break that symmetry with other objects like a mountain, tree or bird.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/b883ce60-a8b8-11f0-aff9-8e54d89222ca" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/b883ce60-a8b8-11f0-aff9-8e54d89222ca" style="height:3456px;width:4608px;" alt="How to improve your smartphone photography " data-uuid="27846cce-b7c6-35ee-8074-2aae3db57894"><figcaption>Rule of thirds used to divide a photo&#39;s elements</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Other composition tips include the use of diagonal rather than horizontal or vertical lines to break up a composition, or curved roads or paths that guide the viewer’s eye. Another popular technique is to use converging lines in architecture when shooting up at buildings. You can also try using foreground objects close to the camera (tree leaves, a pole or a person) to frame a scene. To create dramatic shots using the wide or ultrawide cameras, hold your phone as low as possible — you can even turn it upside down to get it right next to the ground.</p>
<p>Interesting photos also come from strong lighting contrast, particularly shadows. To emphasize that, you can use the exposure compensation (brightness) settings mentioned earlier to make the shadows even darker while keeping your subject well exposed. To find the ideal subject or environment, look for patterns and punchy colors. Don’t be afraid to shoot straight into the light source to create dramatic, backlit silhouettes.</p>
<p>“Smartphones do almost everything well except scene exposure; usually the photos are too bright,” Charpentier says. “And that’s why I very often correct the exposure of my photos. It’s a basic setting and done very simply on iPhone and most Android devices.”</p>
<p>Many smartphone cameras also take great macro photos. You can use that to get close-up shots of subjects ranging from insects in nature to food. Finally, try using the black and white settings on your camera to create a nostalgic mood or emphasize forms and lines.</p>

<p>If you want to play with settings like shutter speed and ISO, reduce automatic or AI settings, take RAW photos or change noise reduction settings, you’ll usually need a third-party app. Here are three I’d recommend.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-vsco">VSCO</h3>
<p>VSCO is a popular editing and camera app for both iOS and Android that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/9/24/20881656/vsco-girl-meme-what-is-a-vsco-girl">had a moment</a> on TikTok several years ago. It gives you control of basic settings like exposure (via a nice slider), shutter speed, ISO and white balance. It also lets you separate focus and exposure points, so you can keep one subject in focus but change the lighting in another area of the scene. It offers RAW support and filters, though many of the latter require a subscription.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-lightroom-mobile">Lightroom Mobile</h3>
<p>To focus on lighting and exposure, check out Lightroom Mobile. It automatically highlights overexposed areas of an image and then lets you easily dial brightness up and down, change settings like ISO and shutter speed  and even apply filters. Once you’re done shooting, you can continue editing your photos afterwards using many of the tools offered in the desktop version. Though no subscription is required, a paid plan is needed for some of the content.</p>
<p>If you’re on iPhone, Adobe has an impressive new experimental app called <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://research.adobe.com/articles/indigo/indigo.html">Indigo</a> that you can try for free. It uses computational photography to improve things like exposure and detail to make photos look more natural.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-halide-mark-ii-ios-only">Halide Mark II (iOS only)</h3>
<p>For control over just about every aspect of your smartphone camera, Halide is the best choice. Unfortunately, it’s only available on iOS. For those in Apple’s ecosystem, it lets you shoot RAW photos with minimal processing (sharpening, etc.) and, according to the developer, has “zero AI right out of the camera.” At the same time, its “Depth Mode” lets you capture portrait shots (ie, artificial depth of field) with any subject. It also comes with a manual mode and tools like color zebras and waveforms to aid with exposure. Halide Mark II isn’t free, though, as it’s $60 for a one-time purchase or $20 yearly.</p>
<p>Before you dive into using an app, I’d recommend that you practice the basics until you feel confident taking photos in any situation. That means making the best use of your smartphone’s camera setup for a given situation, nailing your settings each time and mastering composition. Then, apps like Lightroom Mobile will let you take your photos to another level — like an artist graduating from water colors to oil paint.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/how-to-improve-your-smartphone-photography-010037588.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than 800 public figures including Steve Wozniak and Prince Harry, along with AI scientists, former military leaders and CEOs signed a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e6de299-3eb6-4ba9-8037-266c55c02170">statement</a> demanding a ban on AI work that could lead to superintelligence, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e6de299-3eb6-4ba9-8037-266c55c02170"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> reported. &quot;We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in,&quot; it reads.</p>
<p>The signers include a wide mix of people across sectors and political spectrums, including AI researcher and Nobel prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, former Trump aide Steve Bannon, one time Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and rapper Will.i.am. The statement comes from the Future of Life Institute, which said that AI developments are occurring faster than the public can comprehend.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We’ve, at some level, had this path chosen for us by the AI companies and founders and the economic system that’s driving them, but no one’s really asked almost anybody else, ‘Is this what we want?&#39;&quot; the institute&#39;s executive director, Anthony Aguirre, told <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/ai-superintelligence-ban-from-prince-harry-to-steve-bannon-unlikely-c-rcna238747"><em>NBC News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to the ability of machines to reason and perform tasks as well as a human can, while superintelligence would enable AI to do things better than even human experts. That potential ability has been cited by critics (and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls045904068/">culture in general</a>) as a grave risk to humanity. So far, though, AI has proven itself to be useful only for a narrow range of tasks and consistently fails to handle complex tasks like self-driving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recent breakthroughs, companies like OpenAI are pouring billions into new AI models and the data centers needed to run them. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said that superintelligence was &quot;in sight,&quot; while X CEO Elon Musk said superintelligence &quot;is happening in real time&quot; (Musk has also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-27-elon-musk-is-scared-of-killer-robots.html">famously warned</a> about the potential dangers of AI). OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he expects superintelligence to happen by 2030 at the latest. None of those leaders, nor anyone notable from their companies, signed the statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s far from the only call for a slowdown in AI developement. Last month, more than 200 researchers and public officials, including 10 Nobel Prize winners and multiple artificial intelligence experts, released an urgent call for a &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://red-lines.ai/">red line</a>&quot; against the risks of AI. However, that letter referred not to superintelligence, but dangers already starting to materialize like mass unemployment, climate change and human rights abuses. Other critics are sounding alarms around a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html">potential AI bubble</a> that could eventually pop and take the economy down with it.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/steve-wozniak-prince-harry-and-800-others-want-a-ban-on-ai-superintelligence-123040020.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">budgeting app</a>. There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50.</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-budgeting-apps-has-50-percent-off-annual-subscriptions-right-now-174011845.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tablets are the perfect middle ground between your phone and laptop, giving you the best of both worlds. Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.<br><br>For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</h2> 
<p>Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-tablets">How we test tablets</h2> 
<p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p> 
<p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p> 
<p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p> 
<p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested">Other tablets we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-apple-ipad-mini">Apple iPad mini</h3> 
<p>Apple updated the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html">iPad mini</a> for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-google-pixel-tablet">Google Pixel Tablet</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html">Google Pixel Tablet</a> excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-oneplus-pad">OnePlus Pad</h3> 
<p>The solid <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html">OnePlus Pad</a> is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-tablet-faqs">Tablet FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-brand-for-tablets">What is the best brand for tablets?</h3> 
<p>The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one "best brand" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-a-tablet-replace-a-laptop">Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3> 
<p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-size-screen-do-i-need">What size screen do I need?</h3> 
<p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-tablet-accessories">Tablet accessories</h2> 
<p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html">2-in-1</a> instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came into this review thinking of Private Internet Access (PIA) as one of the better VPNs. It's in the Kape Technologies portfolio, along with the top-tier ExpressVPN and the generally reliable CyberGhost. It's one of the cheapest VPNs out there, its interfaces hold together and it boasts plenty of server locations.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Sadly, I was either misremembering PIA, or it used to be better until someone at Kape fell asleep at the switch. The more I tested this VPN, the more I came to terms with the fact that it's much harder to recommend these days, especially compared to the entries in our <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN guide</a>. The biggest culprit is unmoored download speeds that swing wildly from acceptable to unusable, but I also encountered dropped connections, high latencies and dead ends in the UI.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I want to make it very clear that this PIA review is a snapshot of a moment in time. I don't think this is an inherently bad service, but it needs to do a lot of work to right the ship. As I go through my usual 11-point testing plan, I'll make a (hopefully) cogent case for why you should give PIA a miss as of now.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access downloads and installs with very little friction across all the platforms that support its apps. Since I have basically no complaints about the experience of setting it up, I'll spend this section focusing on how it feels to use PIA on each platform.</p>

</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I have a number of issues with how PIA structures its apps on each OS, but I want to preface them by saying that this VPN generally works fine. It connects quickly, its settings are easy to toggle and it never puts active obstacles in the user's path. Each app except iOS has a soothingly dark aesthetic that's always readable. Keep that baseline in mind when I start describing what PIA could have done better.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There's no good way to describe PIA on Windows or Mac except as a mobile app dragged kicking and screaming onto desktop. This VPN app never misses an opportunity to remind you that it would rather be on your phone. By default, it's attached to your lower toolbar and cannot be moved or resized. You can change the settings to have it launch in a movable window instead, but you still can't change its size.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The main window is cluttered, but once you figure it out, there's a much higher degree of customization than most VPNs offer. Clicking the arrow at the bottom opens a long panel of additional widgets, including quick-connect links, usage stats, a snooze option and buttons for some of the settings you'll use most commonly. You can drag these elements around to reorder them, or click the ribbon icon to move each to the default launch display. It's quite cool — just not especially intuitive.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The server list is another example of PIA's mobile fixation. Despite having an entire screen to work with, PIA on Windows does not let you view the main display and the server list at the same time — you have to click the arrow by the name of the current server to swap in the list of locations. This list can be organized by country name or by live latency test, though the buttons to change this are not clearly marked as such.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Though the search bar works quickly, the streaming-optimized servers are not sorted out from the rest. You have to type "streaming optimized" into search to see if your chosen country has a streaming server.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">You can click the three dots at top-right to go to the settings menu, which is a breath of fresh air after the clunky main UI. Settings are arranged in tabs, and each tab's design makes it easy to tell what its feature does and how to control it. PIA's launch window feels over-engineered to make a distinct first impression, but the settings menu is free from that hangup.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA's Mac app also feels like it was designed for mobile and then ported to desktop. Like the Windows app, it's attached to the toolbar until you change the settings to let it move independently. After that, it has the same problem of being crammed into a mobile-sized window, with the server list and the main UI not visible at the same time.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The Mac version also has the unique problem of not showing up in the system dock, instead working entirely from the toolbar. That said, right-clicking the toolbar does let you connect to the VPN and even choose a location, which is awesome and provides some justification for this design choice (though I'll point out that this could also be done from a dock icon).</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The main window of the Mac app can be reordered or expanded through clicking and dragging just like the Windows UI. The settings panel is accessed the same way and is just as seamless to use. In fact, one big point in PIA's favor is that its two desktop apps are almost identical — water in the desert after the wild swings of <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html">Norton VPN</a>.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-android">Android</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Having already complained twice about PIA's desktop interfaces feeling like mobile apps, I had high hopes for it on Android. While it functions just as smoothly here as everywhere else, it comes with a set of design decisions that are weird in a whole new way.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">First of all, you can't sort the server list alphabetically anymore; it's arranged by current latency instead, which means the list is constantly shifting in real time. Customizing the main window is now done by clicking a button at the top-right of the screen. This flips the entire look in a way that's likely to startle first-time users. It's ultimately the same interface as on desktop — drag widgets around and toggle whether or not they're seen — but it could be handled better.</p> 
<figure>

</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The preferences list is not nearly as user-friendly as on the two desktop apps. Most of the important features are buried two menus deep under the tab marked "Settings," except for split tunneling, which is called "Per App Settings" for some reason (and barely explained).</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The larger issue, though, is that PIA on Android is extremely dependent on making you change system settings outside the app — which would be fine, except that it hasn't figured out a working interface for actually doing that. Almost every time I was prompted to change something in the settings, I got stuck on a prompt page with a useless button. Going into Settings and making the changes manually did nothing to unstick these pages.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Of all PIA's VPN apps, iOS is the closest to a home run, save for the inexplicable decision to lock the interface in light mode. I gather PIA was just trying to keep its iOS and Android apps visually distinct, but throwing out one of its best aesthetic choices isn't the way to do that.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">That gripe aside, everything else is nearly ideal, pointing to iPhone and iPad as PIA's natural home. The option to toggle what appears on the main page is finally done right — you still have to tap a button that causes a bit of whiplash, but it's much clearer what you're meant to do in order to shift, add and remove widgets.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA's browser extensions are available for Chrome and Firefox. They look fairly similar to the desktop app, but with some distinct features for the web. The best is the ability to instantly add the website you're currently on to the bypass list, which is incredibly handy if you're doing something non-sensitive and the VPN is actively slowing it down.</p> 
<figure>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The extra features are organized into three categories: security, privacy and tracking. Security blocks WebRTC leaks and automatically connects unsecured websites through HTTPS. Privacy blocks websites from accessing your camera, microphone or real location and can prevent you from connecting to websites with known security concerns. Tracking, as you might guess, blocks various forms of activity trackers.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">It's both very thorough and surprisingly different from any of PIA's other apps — there's reason to use this extension even if you're already using a PIA app on the same device. However, its explanations of each feature rely a bit too much on technical jargon, so casual users might not find many of them helpful.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-other-platforms">Other platforms</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access can also be installed on Linux and has native apps for Apple TV and Android TV. To protect any other internet-capable device, including game consoles, you can install PIA on your router, which automatically protects any device connecting through your home WiFi.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-speed-test">Private Internet Access speed test</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I used Speedtest by Ookla to test how much Private Internet Access impacted my browsing speeds. Running a VPN inevitably reduces download speed (how fast web pages display), upload speed (for posting and torrenting) and latency (the gap in real-time communications, such as during games and live chats. The real question, then, is whether PIA can keep those reductions as minimal as possible — like <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html">my current speed champion, Surfshark</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This speed test was a marked disappointment. PIA had some of the most inconsistent readings I've seen on a VPN in some time — so bad I initially assumed there was something wrong with the speed tester. I ran more speed tests on more days than I usually do, just to make sure a fluke outlier didn't permanently taint PIA's score. Speeds were often good, but occasional sharp drops suppressed them.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This problem was especially pronounced with latency. In practically every test, the three pings swung wildly, sometimes ending up above 2000 milliseconds (or, as we call it in the business, two seconds). I can't say what the problem is, but until PIA fixes it, I don't suggest using this VPN for any split-second gaming.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Additionally, on my first day of testing, the server location PIA chose as the fastest gave me four-digit pings, download speeds below 2 Mbps and no upload speeds at all. Other servers worked, so the problem wasn't on my end. This didn't happen in every location by any means, nor on every test — but it repeated in Montreal, implying an issue with more than one PIA server.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Due to several low outliers, PIA's worldwide averages don't look good at all compared to other VPNs. The best news in the table above is that upload speed only dropped by about 11 percent, and download speed by about 34 percent, retaining two-thirds of my unprotected speed. But the inconsistency is a serious problem; PIA might be quite fast at times, but it’s unpredictable. I've reached out to PIA for comment on its speeds and will update this when I receive a reply.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-security-test">Private Internet Access security test</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Since most websites today use HTTPS encryption, it's very difficult for third parties to see precisely what you do online — but motivated people can still see your real location and the sites you visit. The purpose of a VPN is not to keep you completely anonymous or safe online, but to prevent your IP address and DNS requests from being visible to your internet service provider or anyone else.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I looked from three different angles to see whether Private Internet Access is actually capable of doing what its name promises. First, I checked to make sure it uses VPN protocols considered to be secure. I next used an IP address checker to see if any locations leaked my IP address, and finally ran a WireShark test to ensure all protocols applied encryption evenly.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA uses three VPN protocols to mediate between your device and its servers — OpenVPN (over TCP or UDP), WireGuard and IKEv2/IPSec. <strong>OpenVPN</strong> has provided reliable VPN security for many years now; it's open-source and constantly updated by volunteers to stay current. TCP is slower but more stable, while UDP is faster but more likely to drop connections. OpenVPN is available on all PIA apps.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><strong>WireGuard </strong>is a newer protocol that PIA <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=contributed+to+the+development+of&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvd2lyZWd1aWRlLWFsbC1hYm91dC10aGUtd2lyZWd1YXJkLXZwbi1wcm90b2NvbC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkMzlmY2ZmLWE3M2EtNDM2ZC1iZmRiLWRlNjE3ZTUzNGU3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpdmF0ZWludGVybmV0YWNjZXNzLmNvbS9ibG9nL3dpcmVndWlkZS1hbGwtYWJvdXQtdGhlLXdpcmVndWFyZC12cG4tcHJvdG9jb2wvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAexs9VEqW-drjn25LFpPgnLe1rDjmBA-Lxq-aaJTGWJs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fblog%2Fwireguide-all-about-the-wireguard-vpn-protocol%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/wireguide-all-about-the-wireguard-vpn-protocol/">contributed to the development of</a>. It's leaner and often faster than OpenVPN, and uses a stream cipher that's harder to crack (though in practice, both WireGuard and OpenVPN use cryptography unbeatable by existing technology). WireGuard is available on all PIA apps.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">WireGuard's one downside is that it stores user IP addresses to keep the tunnel open — but that's no issue if a VPN is following its no-logging policy, which I believe PIA is. See "Close-reading PIA's privacy policy" for more details.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><strong>IKEv2/IPSec </strong>is only present on PIA's iOS app. Its ability to stay connected through rapid network changes makes it great for mobile, so it's disappointing not to see it on Android as well. IKEv2 isn't open-source like OpenVPN and WireGuard, but when paired with the IPSec suite, it's just as secure.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">To run this test, I wrote down my IP address without VPN protection. Then I connected to several PIA servers and checked whether ipleak.net showed me a different IP address, ideally in a wholly different location. PIA passed the first round of tests easily, as you can see in the screenshot below — I never once saw my real location, which means neither DNS nor WebRTC was leaking it. PIA also blocks IPv6 on all apps to prevent it from leaking (this can't be disabled).</p>

So I added another test in which I changed servers several times while watching the IP leak test. PIA passed this test as well, always jumping seamlessly from one VPN location to the next without ever revealing my real IP address.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The last step in testing VPN security is to use a packet sniffer like WireShark to make sure the traffic you send is actually getting encrypted. It's pretty rare for even the jankiest of VPNs to fail this part, but any VPN that does<em>&nbsp;</em>fail gets an automatic blanket no. Luckily, PIA passed on all three protocols, as WireShark showed data packets with clear encryption.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-how-much-does-private-internet-access-cost">How much does Private Internet Access cost?</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Cost is one of the biggest reasons to pick Private Internet Access as your main VPN. At the monthly level, it costs $11.95 — not that much cheaper than its competitors and more expensive than some of the best, including <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a>.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The long-term plans change all of that. One year of PIA costs just under $40, or $3.33 per month. The three-year plan is an even heavier discount, costing just $79 and including three bonus months in the first period. That works out to $2.03 per month for the first three years and $2.19 per month after that.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A single PIA subscription can be used on an unlimited number of devices. This could potentially stretch your money further still, covering an entire family, friend group or small business. Having said that, as with Surfshark, you can still be restricted for using an excessive number of devices. PIA's <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=terms+of+service&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL3Rlcm1zLW9mLXNlcnZpY2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkMzlmY2ZmLWE3M2EtNDM2ZC1iZmRiLWRlNjE3ZTUzNGU3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpdmF0ZWludGVybmV0YWNjZXNzLmNvbS90ZXJtcy1vZi1zZXJ2aWNlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATx-uckKYcl4VAlQnZWuqbM01NJ4H5APZhxHjBSWQcbu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fterms-of-service" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> document states that it may contact users who appear to be abusing the privilege and can restrict access to the VPN if the abuse persists.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-side-apps-and-bundles">Private Internet Access side apps and bundles</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Alongside the basic Private Internet Access VPN service, there are a couple of add-ons worth noting. You can select one or both of these on the checkout page after choosing your plan.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA Antivirus runs continuous malware scans and sends you alerts whenever any activity matches its database of known viruses. You can schedule system-wide scans to catch malware that might have made it through the net. There's also a quarantine box for storing malicious files. The main thing you won't get is the kind of actively learning antivirus system that can catch new threats based on their behavior — for that, I still recommend a dedicated AV app. Adding antivirus costs $4.50 per month, $24 for a year or $36 for three years.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A dedicated IP address ensures you'll have the same IP address every time you connect to the VPN. A constantly fluctuating IP can trigger CAPTCHAs on some pages, so if you're sick of having to identify crosswalks just to use Google, this extra fee might be worth it. You can also add your dedicated IP to allowlists for remote access services. A dedicated IP address through PIA costs $5 a month, $51 for a year or $90 for three years.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-close-reading-private-internet-accesss-privacy-policy">Close-reading Private Internet Access's privacy policy</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A VPN's privacy policy is a legal document that lays out the terms of its relationship with its users. It's easy to assume it's all hollow words, but directly contradicting its own policy can get a provider in trouble. Looking closely at PIA's privacy policy can tell us what its priorities are, what your rights are as a user and how much you can trust it not to exploit its access to your secrets.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA is a Kape Technologies property, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">like ExpressVPN</a> and CyberGhost. I'll get into that more in the background check, but for this section, my overriding question was whether any loopholes in the privacy policy might allow PIA to share user data with its parent company, and from there to its other properties.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Fortunately for me (and everyone who cares about this stuff and isn't a lawyer), PIA has a very succinct and transparent privacy policy, mostly made up of bullet points. At the top, the policy states that PIA always handles customer data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), even outside of the EU. Further down, we get this key statement:</p> 
<figure>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">That's pretty definitive, leaving very little wiggle room. It doesn't include device fingerprints, which can be used in place of IP addresses and activity logs, but lower down, the policy states that device identifiers can only be gathered from users who opt in — and thankfully, PIA's apps do not send that information by default.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The next section discusses what PIA can do with the information it does collect. It's permitted to share customer support data with Deskpro, which powers its live chat assistance. It also uses Stripe, PayPal, Amazon Pay and BitPay for payments, but sharing email addresses and payment methods with financial processors is standard even for the most private VPNs (Mullvad has this same carve-out, to name one).</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA ends the privacy policy by addressing the question of its parent company, Kape Technologies, stating: "neither PIA nor anyone at Kape Technologies logs or stores any kind of substantiative [sic] Personal Data, user browsing data, or individual connection data other than what has been outlined here, nor do we share any personal or usage information with third parties for marketing purposes."</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Misspelling aside, I'm perfectly satisfied with the policy. Combined with PIA's use of RAM-only servers without long-term information storage, this document all but eliminates the potential for abuse. A PIA representative confirmed for me that while some user data is handled by "cross-group employees," none of it is sensitive or identifiable.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-independent-privacy-audits">Independent privacy audits</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Third-party audits are one more critical piece of evidence we can use to decide whether a VPN is trustworthy. PIA <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=passed+an+audit+of+its+systems&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvc2VjdXJpdHktYXVkaXQtMjAyNC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkMzlmY2ZmLWE3M2EtNDM2ZC1iZmRiLWRlNjE3ZTUzNGU3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpdmF0ZWludGVybmV0YWNjZXNzLmNvbS9ibG9nL3NlY3VyaXR5LWF1ZGl0LTIwMjQvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZdDfw-ed5MNWkj75tcJxDAE_DP3IE1Mbg8cSsbOc7Ek&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fblog%2Fsecurity-audit-2024%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/security-audit-2024/">passed an audit of its systems</a> by Deloitte Romania in April 2024, which found that it was adhering to its no-logs policy.</p> 
<p>The report itself is only available to subscribers, which is a bit annoying, but at least not unique. After downloading it through my account portal, I was able to confirm that Deloitte's investigation found nothing in PIA's systems that went against its privacy statements.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-can-private-internet-access-change-your-virtual-location">Can Private Internet Access change your virtual location?</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Chances are good that you found this review because you need a VPN to mask your virtual location, whether that's to <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html">get around age verification</a> or to see what's streaming on your favorite platforms in other countries. This section's test is designed to see if Private Internet Access is able to change your virtual location convincingly enough for Netflix.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I tried connecting three times in each in five different locations and recorded my results in the table. I used the streaming-optimized servers whenever possible, and the WireGuard protocol for the best speeds. "Unblocked Netflix" shows whether I got to Netflix without being caught using a VPN, and "Changed content" shows whether I actually saw a new library.</p> 
<table>

</table> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">My findings continued the trend of PIA being just good enough that I'm frustrated by the ways it fails to be better. PIA never got caught, which indicates that it's taking care to not use IP addresses Netflix has blocked. Three of the five locations — in Japan, Australia and Italy — managed to change the contest I saw.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">However, with all nine tests in each of those three virtual locations, PIA's speeds dragged so much that I waited several minutes to see if it had actually worked. The other two server locations, Canada and the UK, didn't change Netflix at all, no matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The bigger problem, though, is that PIA's fluctuating speeds meant Netflix took ages to load and often froze until I refreshed it. Shows stuttered and lagged even when I could watch them. Until it fixes whatever is going on with its speeds, PIA won't be a good choice for streaming in any location.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-investigating-private-internet-accesss-server-network">Investigating Private Internet Access's server network</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access has 155 server locations in 91 countries. Confusingly, I counted that it also has 91 virtual server locations, though it's not the same 91. Its network is heavily weighted toward Europe, which accounts for 44 countries, but there's also decent representation in Asia. Traditionally underserved South America and Africa get nine and four locations respectively, though they're all virtual.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Virtual server locations aren't necessarily a bad thing, but when used to excess, they may indicate that a VPN is more concerned with making its server network look big than ensuring it works for every user. PIA's server network is more than half virtual worldwide. Recently, it's added locations in every US state — again, mostly virtual, which makes it come off as more of a stunt than a genuine improvement. Given the trouble I had using PIA for this review, I find that there's something to the claim that it's more interested in growing than in working.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA's website has a helpful page that shows <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/kb/articles/virtual-server-locations-we-offer">where virtual servers are physically located</a>, though it's out of date, having been updated last in July 2023. The list shows that PIA tries to put the real locations of virtual servers as close to their displayed locations as possible. There are a couple of weird choices, like the Buenos Aires server really being in Miami, but that's mostly kept to a minimum.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-extra-features-of-private-internet-access">Extra features of Private Internet Access</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access doesn't have the wealth of features you'll see on the likes of Surfshark or <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN</a>, but it's not quite as bare-bones as ExpressVPN, either. Some of its most interesting extras are self-explanatory, while others are a little technical. I'll explain the most important features here.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-kill-switch">Kill switch</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A kill switch is a must-have for a safe VPN. While active, the kill switch makes it impossible to connect outside the VPN tunnel, which keeps you from accidentally connecting to malicious fake servers. This also means that if PIA drops your connection for any reason, you won't be able to get online at all — which can be annoying, but saves you from broadcasting any sensitive information without encryption.</p> 
<figure>

 <div class="photo-credit">
   Sam Chapman for Engadget 
 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA comes with two levels of kill switch. The basic version watches for traffic outside the tunnel when the VPN is active. The stronger "advanced kill switch" works even when you aren't connected to the VPN, so you cannot get online at all without being protected by PIA first.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-pia-mace">PIA MACE</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">MACE is PIA's ad blocker. It keeps a list of domains known to display ads, malware, scams or invasive trackers, and blocks them all from loading. This won't stop all ads, since some of them come from domains considered legitimate — notably, MACE can't do anything about YouTube video ads — but it works on most banner ads and definitely lightened the load on my browser.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">MACE is available on all PIA's apps except iOS. iPhone and iPad users instead get a content blocker that does much the same thing, but only on Safari. If you prefer to use Chrome or Firefox on your iOS device, you're out of luck (unless of course you get another ad blocker).</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-maximum-transfer-unit-mtu">Maximum transfer unit (MTU)</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">MTU is a somewhat technical feature. You may not need it, unless your connection is extremely sluggish and the traditional fixes don't work. In short, MTU limits how much data can move through PIA's servers at a time. Large packets complete loading faster, but may struggle on shaky connections. Small packets make for slower but more stable downloads overall.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I say you probably won't need it because it's almost always best to leave it on the auto setting and let PIA pick MTU on its own. I ran some speed tests with both the large and small MTU options and didn't see a noticeable difference. That indicates that PIA is pretty good at picking the best MTU, so in most cases, just let it cook.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-automation">Automation</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">On the automation tab in PIA's settings, you can set up rules to save you some trouble with the VPN. On Mac and iOS, automation can respond to three types of network: protected Wi-Fi, open Wi-Fi and wired. On each of these, you can set PIA to automatically connect or disconnect. That's it — you can only have a maximum of three rules.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Android and Windows users get the option to make rules for specific networks, but only the network they're currently connected to. On every platform, there's no way to determine which server PIA auto-connects to. It always picks the fastest.</p>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The inch-deep options on their own would make for a disappointing feature, but there's a bigger issue: it doesn't work half the time. I spent at least an hour on four different platforms trying to make automation happen. On iOS and macOS, I could make the rules, but they never triggered. With Android, I got stuck at a prompt telling me to enable location services, which I had already done.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Windows was the only version where PIA's automation worked the first time. On the plus side, it gave me the question I used to test PIA's customer support.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Split tunneling — which lets you decide which apps or websites go through the VPN tunnel and which stay outside — is a common feature, but PIA surprisingly has one of the best implementations of it. To start with, it can split tunnel by app or by IP address, which lets you protect specific websites or leave them unencrypted.</p> 
<figure> 
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/7d83fd80-adea-11f0-bf7d-863e04ca11ce" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/7d83fd80-adea-11f0-bf7d-863e04ca11ce" style="height:1335px;width:1954px;" alt="PIA split tunneling" data-uuid="a4f600d2-76dc-39a7-8dfc-2c1810d0a097">

 <div class="photo-credit">
   Sam Chapman for Engadget 
 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In another layer of versatility, you can make your split tunnel rules in normal or inverse fashion. Either every app and website uses the VPN except the ones you designate, or <em>only </em>the ones you designate use the VPN. All these options give you a much finer level of control that you get over the automation feature.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-multi-hop-via-shadowsocks-and-socks5">Multi-Hop via Shadowsocks and SOCKS5</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Double-hop or multi-hop is when a VPN runs your requests through two servers instead of one. PIA handles multi-hop a little differently than other VPNs, as the second server will always be a Shadowsocks or SOCKS5 proxy. These two protocols are designed to obfuscate VPN traffic so it looks like a regular connection, which gets you around certain firewalls.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">If you choose a SOCKS5 proxy, you'll need to get a server address from an outside service and set it up yourself. If you pick Shadowsocks, which is the more secure option anyway, you can choose from a list of locations to use as the first node. It's nice to have so many choices, but still a bit frustrating that you can't get obfuscation without also using double VPN (which only works on the OpenVPN protocol).</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The final PIA feature worth noting is port forwarding, which keeps the VPN from getting in the way of any outward-facing services you might be using. This gives you a more stable connection on remote desktop protocols or torrenting clients — especially the latter, as that's the sort of traffic you really want to keep encrypted.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-customer-support-options">Private Internet Access customer support options</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">When I set out to test the automation features of Private Internet Access, I found myself blocked on the Android app. A notification popped up telling me to enable background access to location services, but the button labeled "go to permissions settings" didn't do anything. I took the long way around and made the changes myself, but the pop-up remained stubborn.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This gave me a perfect opportunity to see how PIA helps users caught in predicaments like this one. First, I went to the website and clicked "support" in the top banner to reach the <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/">PIA helpdesk</a>. Then the trouble started. I opened up the Android guide on my Mac laptop and waited several minutes for the file to load. When it didn't, I tried my Android phone, which also didn't work. I checked back on the laptop, where I finally saw the guide after reloading the page.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">After all that, the guide said nothing about my problem. Nor could I find it anywhere in the general FAQs, which kept splitting into smaller and smaller categories which never really explained what I'd find. However, after a few minutes of searching, I found the problem had resolved itself with no explanation.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-live-support-experience">Live support experience</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I still had to test live chat, though, so I pivoted to a new problem: how to get the Android automation feature to recognize my home Wi-Fi network instead of calling it "unknown SSID." I couldn't be sure it was my own network and not a malicious duplicate. This may sound like paranoid nitpicking, but paranoid nitpicking is the bread and butter of cybersecurity.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I first had to find live chat, which confusingly can't be accessed through the helpdesk — you have to go back to the main website. I managed to get past the AI gatekeeper fairly quickly, and sat to wait for a human agent.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In less than a minute, I was chatting with Carl, who requested screenshots and ran me through some tests. Carl was able to explain that the pop-up problem had resolved because I'd given PIA full access to location services (which is not something the window itself specified I would need to do), but the unknown SSID issue persisted.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Carl was diligent, but slow. After well over 30 minutes of back-and-forth, during which I sent over two screenshots and a debug log, he told me we'd have to escalate the problem. I got an email from the support team about a day later that suggested I try connecting to other Wi-Fi networks and see if the problem persisted; this eventually led me to discover the culprit in my router settings, so I can't blame PIA for this one.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-background-check">Private Internet Access background check</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The final step, as always, is to look into the history of Private Internet Access as a corporation and look for any red flags I may have missed. A VPN's biography can reveal its attitudes about critical aspects of its job and show how it might behave in the future.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA was launched in 2010 by Andrew Lee in Denver, Colorado, where it's still based today. In 2019, the brand was acquired by <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://torrentfreak.com/private-internet-access-to-be-acquired-by-kape/">Kape Technologies</a>, owners of ExpressVPN, CyberGhost and the now-defunct ZenMate. I won't relitigate the full Kape controversy here; you can find a longer summary in my <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">ExpressVPN review</a>. Suffice to say that while it's come under scrutiny in the past for tacitly allowing its products to become malware vectors, there's no evidence the acquisition changed anything substantial about how PIA operated.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Most of the usual red flags aren't factors here. PIA has never suffered a serious hack or breach. In its 15-year record, I only found two things worth pointing out: a controversial executive and its United States headquarters.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-former-cto-mark-karpeles">Former CTO Mark Karpeles</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Mark Karpeles was the CEO of Mt. Gox, the market for <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>trading cards that became the world's largest crypto exchange, only to <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mt-gox.asp">lose it all in a massive hack</a> that's never been fully explained. Karpeles was arrested in Japan after the heist and <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://archive.is/pmkR0">found guilty of falsifying records</a>, but was sentenced to time served and released in 2019.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">While the Japan trial was ongoing, <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-former-ceo-karpeles-lands-new-job/">Karpeles joined PIA parent company London Trust Media</a> as its chief technical officer. PIA founder Andrew Lee defended the hiring in <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=a+statement+on+the+PIA+blog&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvd2h5LWktaGlyZWQtbXQtZ294LWV4LWNlby1tYXJrLWthcnBlbGVzLWFzLWN0by1vZi1sb25kb24tdHJ1c3QtbWVkaWEvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZDM5ZmNmZi1hNzNhLTQzNmQtYmZkYi1kZTYxN2U1MzRlN2YiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByaXZhdGVpbnRlcm5ldGFjY2Vzcy5jb20vYmxvZy93aHktaS1oaXJlZC1tdC1nb3gtZXgtY2VvLW1hcmsta2FycGVsZXMtYXMtY3RvLW9mLWxvbmRvbi10cnVzdC1tZWRpYS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY70OT-HwDyh2fV_XGpYDPuvVmkeoF7JW0Fy2brwt_1B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fblog%2Fwhy-i-hired-mt-gox-ex-ceo-mark-karpeles-as-cto-of-london-trust-media%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/why-i-hired-mt-gox-ex-ceo-mark-karpeles-as-cto-of-london-trust-media/">a statement on the PIA blog</a>, writing that "If we, as a society, do not give second chances to those who fall, then we as a society will cease to progress," and comparing Karpeles's arrest to Steve Jobs being forced out of Apple.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Neither man works at PIA anymore. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/karpeles?trk=people-guest_people_search-card">his LinkedIn</a>, Karpeles left London Trust Media after the Kape Acquisition in 2019. Lee left at the same time, and these days seems less interested in cybersecurity than in <a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-andrew-lee-became-the-crown-prince-of-koreaand-made-a-digital-kingdom/">trying to become the Prince of Korea</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Bottom line: Although hiring an executive in the middle of his malfeasance trial may be terrible optics, the whole controversy isn't relevant to the VPN's operations today.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-us-headquarters-and-five-eyes">US headquarters and Five Eyes</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The other potential sticking point with PIA is that it's headquartered in the United States, which is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing agreement. Now, I'm on the record as not thinking Five Eyes is a big deal for a VPN — either the VPN is following its privacy policy, in which case it'll have nothing to share with intelligence agents, or it's not, in which case its location is the least of its problems.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">As I concluded in the Privacy section, whatever PIA's flaws, it's not mishandling user data or violating its own privacy policy. That's not only confirmed by two audits, but also by <a data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://torrentfreak.com/private-internet-access-no-logging-claims-proven-true-again-in-court-180606/">two separate</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:38;pos:1" href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-no-logging-claims-tested-in-fbi-case-160312/">court cases</a> in which PIA was unable to comply with requests for logs on its customers. If the VPN doesn't save information, there's nothing for Five Eyes to access.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There's plenty that does work about PIA. Its privacy and security are unimpeachable — it uses vetted protocols with strong encryption and doesn't leak. Its iOS app is a nearly perfect mobile VPN, and the ability to customize the home screen on every app is a great touch. Split tunneling is outstanding, MACE blocks ads efficiently and I even like the automation (though I wish it was deeper).</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">But PIA is aggravating to use in too many ways. While its servers are frequently fast, you can't trust that download speeds will hold from one moment to the next. Basic quality assurance, like assuring pop-up buttons always do something when pressed, seems to have gone by the wayside in its Android app.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In spite of it all, I still recommend Private Internet Access as a budget VPN. Its three-year plan is the cheapest subscription on the market right now. At $2.00 per month, I'm prepared to forgive a lot, especially at a time when all our wallets are squeezed.</p>

With a 61-megapixel sensor, it shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter. Even after a few years, it's still one of the best high-resolution full-frame cameras on the market and is an exceptional steal at this price.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Though also released a few years ago, Sony's A7 IV received an <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">excellent Engadget review score</a> and is still one of the best mainstream cameras available. Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawbacks are rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter, plus the relatively high price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-wireless-headphones-for-you">How to choose the best wireless headphones for you</h2> 
<p>When it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">Bluetooth</a> multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html">Spatial Audio</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html">Dolby Atmos</a>, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-over-ear-headphones">How we test over-ear headphones</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> 
<p>To judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-headphones-we-tested">Other wireless headphones we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-max">AirPods Max</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dyson-on-trac">Dyson On-Trac</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sonos-ace">Sonos Ace</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-ult-wear">Sony ULT Wear</h3> 
<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wh-ch720n">Sony WH-CH720N</h3> 
<p>While the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-ch720n-review-160032871.html">WH-CH720N</a> are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-studio-pro">Beats Studio Pro</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review-a-new-spin-on-a-reliable-formula-160009025.html">Bose’s latest flagship model</a> has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p>

<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">here</a>, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-headphones-faqs">Wireless headphones FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-can-you-tell-the-quality-of-wireless-headphones">How can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-choose-the-best-quality-wireless-headphones">How do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-brand-has-the-best-wireless-headphones">Which brand has the best wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>Sony consistently tops our list with <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">its 1000X line</a>. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">like Bose</a>, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-expensive-wireless-headphones-sound-better">Do expensive wireless headphones sound better?</h3> 
<p>Exorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">Bowers &amp; Wilkins’</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html">headphones</a> are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html">Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2</a> is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss]]></description>

It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last over 18hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M4 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design.<br><br>Of course, not everyone wants a MacBook, and there are excellent <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-windows-laptop-130018256.html">Windows laptops</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebooks</a> out there, too.

Chromebooks, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and are great for users who mostly work online. Whether you need a powerhouse for creative work, a compact system for note-taking, or a laptop that can handle family movie night, there’s something for everyone in today’s laptop market.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-laptops">How we test laptops</h2> 
<p>Engadget has been <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-20/">reviewing laptops for two decades</a>, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-we-test-laptops-203909669.html">testing</a> their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft's Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP's Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-a-laptop">Factors to consider when choosing a laptop</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-system-apple-windows-or-chrome-os">Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS</h3> 
<p>There's a good chance you've already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it's another story if you've become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.</p> 
<p>If you're an Apple-loyalist, there aren't many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple's <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">MacBooks</a>, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we've ever seen. They're incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you're used to iOS and iPadOS.</p> 
<p>That brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple's other platforms. You can't respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+Phone+Link+app&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvc3luYy1hY3Jvc3MteW91ci1kZXZpY2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvd2luZG93cy9zeW5jLWFjcm9zcy15b3VyLWRldmljZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf6ecThFK8UkL1n9MqlvWg-rE0x3ymgn2Y8PiFuAQZb1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fsync-across-your-devices" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/sync-across-your-devices">Microsoft's Phone Link app</a> lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone's photos.</p> 
<p>If cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.</p> 
<p>As for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.</p> 
<p>And what about ChromeOS? <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebooks</a> are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they're not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren't many apps or games that work offline, and they also don't work with powerful software suites like Adobe's (you can use the stripped-down <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/02/adobe-express-photoshop-google-chromebook-plus">Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools</a>, though).</p> 
<p>Chromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they're popular in schools because they're cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.</p> 
<p>If, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-chromebook-plus-initiative-pushes-higher-spec-standards-and-handy-software-tools-130055583.html">Chromebook Plus models</a> to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">company’s online AI features</a>, like AI image generation and photo processing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you're looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you're willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.</p> 
<p>I’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">the best budget laptops</a> that you can check out as well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-laptop-size-and-weight">Laptop size and weight</h3> 
<p>So how portable do you want your laptop to be? That's the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it's enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).</p> 
<p>If you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.</p> 
<p>For artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you'd expect, you'll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.</p> 
<p>If you're in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.</p> 
<p>You can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming systems</a> or souped-up workstations. They're not meant for mere computing mortals.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports-and-connectivity">Ports and connectivity</h3> 
<p>These days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple's MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you'll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft's Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-spectre-x360-14-review-2024-keeping-the-2-in-1-laptop-dream-alive-140045823.html">HP's Spectre x360 14</a>, as well as many models from ASUS.</p> 
<p>For gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.</p> 
<p>If you're a fan of wired headphones, it's worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that's a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it's still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.</p> 
<p>Most laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">routers</a> and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn't made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there <em>are</em> notebooks like the <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">Surface Pro 9</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-180044021.html">Samsung Galaxy Book</a> models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life"><strong>Battery life</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop's battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.</p> 
<p>If battery life is your absolute priority, I'd strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple's M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you'd expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-refresh-rate"><strong>Refresh rate</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop's refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we're seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)</p> 
<p>While high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we're seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-and-gpu">CPU and GPU</h3> 
<p>If you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems.</p> 
<p>You'll also see AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD's main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel's Arc hardware (though those are getting better).</p> 
<p>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-rebuilt-windows-11-around-ai-and-arm-chips-173152776.html">rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture</a>, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.</p> 
<p>As for Apple's laptops, you'll be choosing between the M4 Pro, M4 Max and M5, each of which is progressively more powerful.</p> 
<p>On the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop's display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD's chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA's RTX 40-series hardware or AMD's Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.</p> 
<p>Apple's M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD's lower-end dedicated GPUs. That's quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it's another reason we highly recommend Apple's notebooks.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ai-pcs-npus-and-copilot"><strong>AI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+</strong></h3> 
<p>Simply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).</p> 
<p>We were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html">AMD announced</a> in 2023. Intel unveiled its <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">"Core Ultra" CPUs</a> in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-8040-chips-remind-intel-its-falling-behind-in-ai-pcs-200043544.html">Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips</a> that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). But in May, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html">Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative</a>, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.</p> 
<p>Copilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-postpones-the-launch-of-its-controversial-recall-ai-feature-031554596.html">Recall</a>, which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-paint-is-getting-an-ai-powered-image-generator-that-responds-to-your-text-prompts-and-doodles-190653716.html">Cocreator in Paint</a>, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.</p> 
<p>If you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.</p> 
<p>At the time of this post, <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">Chromebook Plus notebooks</a> can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.</p> 
<p><a href="#jump-link-table-of-contents">Back to top</a></p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-laptops-we-tested">Other laptops we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition">Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html">ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition</a> is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.</p> 
<p>While the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14’s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. It’s mushier than we’d like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. You’ll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.</p> 
<p>Where the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-14-oled">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</h3> 
<p>Aside from its lovely OLED screen, the <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-14-oled-review-ai-pc-143054247.html">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</a> doesn't stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I'd recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-razer-blade-14">Razer Blade 14</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-2024-review-a-portable-but-pricey-powerhouse-specs-price-160020891.html">Razer Blade</a> has almost everything you'd want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it's far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it's certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-framework-laptop-16">Framework Laptop 16</h3> 
<p>Framework gave its modularity magic to the <a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-16-review-modular-wonder-mediocre-gaming-laptop-150026910.html">Laptop 16</a>, delivering a gaming notebook where almost every single component is user replaceable. But you'll have to pay a pretty penny to snag it with upgraded hardware, and its optional Radeon 7700S GPU was surprisingly slow.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-alienware-m16-r2">Alienware m16 R2</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-m16-r2-review-when-less-power-makes-for-a-better-laptop-174027103.html">Alienware m16 r2</a> has been revamped with a slimmer case, but it’s otherwise a fairly typical gaming laptop. It’s a solid option for Alienware fans, but you’ll find better hardware and deals elsewhere.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-duo-2024">ASUS Zenbook Duo (2024)</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-specs-price-the-first-dual-screen-laptop-worth-buying-130016756.html">Zenbook Duo</a> is a fascinating dual-screened notebook, and according to my colleague Sam Rutherford it’s the first of its kind that’s worth buying. But its unique hardware isn’t really meant for mainstream consumers, and Windows 11 still doesn’t support multi-screen setups well enough to make full use of the Zenbook Duo’s ample canvas.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dell-xps-16">Dell XPS 16</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-16-review-beauty-and-power-comes-at-a-cost-200513721.html">Dell’s XPS 16</a> is big and beautiful, but it’s far too expensive compared to the competition. Plus, it uses a capacitive row of function keys that you basically can’t see under bright light and has too few ports for a machine of this size.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-laptop-faqs">Laptop FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-average-battery-life-of-a-laptop-per-charge">What is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?</h3> 
<p>It’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-ram-do-i-really-need">How much RAM do I really need?</h3> 
<p>The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you <em>could</em> use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start.</p> 
<p>If you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-storage-capacity-for-a-laptop">What is the best storage capacity for a laptop?</h3> 
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB <a data-i13n="cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ssds-140014262.html">SSDs</a> (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.</p> 
<p>If you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.</p> 
<p>We recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-a-good-price-range-for-a-decent-laptop-in-2025">What's a good price range for a decent laptop in 2025?</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you'll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-macos-and-windows-which-is-better">What’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?</h3> 
<p>Simply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple's notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You'll also find Chromebooks running Google's ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.</p> 
<p>Debating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the '80s, so we won't be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.</p> 
<p>But if you care more about playing the newest games, you'll want to have a Windows system. If you're more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you're running an iPhone).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-laptop-brands">What are the best laptop brands?</h3> 
<p>There is no single "best" laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we're generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option that’s the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, <a data-i13n="cpos:45;pos:1" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52019024">dominate laptop sales worldwide</a>. We'd avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don't have a major presence in the US.</p>

It&#39;s working in collaboration with two eyewear companies, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-galaxy-xr-opening-new-worlds#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20its,play%20into%20daily%20life.">AI-powered smart glasses</a> to go up against Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban models, Samsung&#39;s head of customer experience Jay Kim <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/ITXJquX9FqM?t=6714">announced</a> at the end of the livestream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re also really excited about the AI glasses that we&#39;re currently building together with Google,&quot; Kim said. &quot;We&#39;re working with two of the most forward-thinking brands in eyewear, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, to introduce new devices that fit into your lifestyle.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung will focus on two different markets with those brands, though both will include &quot;cutting-edge&quot; AI features co-developed with Google. With Gentle Monster, it&#39;s developing &quot;fashion-forward&quot; glasses that will likely be aimed at the higher end of the market. The Warby Parker collaboration, meanwhile, will yield eyewear designed for general consumers, probably at a lower price point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung only said that the AI glasses will bring &quot;style, comfort and practicality&quot; to everyday life via Android&#39;s XR ecosystem. As we <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-xr-glasses-hands-on-lightweight-but-with-a-limited-field-of-view-213940554.html">saw in May</a> with Google&#39;s prototype XR smart glasses, it will likely employ a Gemini-powered display that will show notifications and small snippets of info from your apps, like the music you&#39;re listening to or turn-by-turn GPS directions. It should also have a built-in camera, of course, along with speakers and a microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design and appearance will also be key, but Samsung has yet to show any images of the upcoming smart glasses and didn&#39;t reveal a release date. However, it will have a tough climb against Meta&#39;s lineup given the Ray-Ban branding and that company&#39;s head start on the technology. Last week, Meta introduced  its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Ray-Ban Display model</a> that includes a screen for a true extended reality experience.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-is-working-on-xr-smart-glasses-with-warby-parker-and-gentle-monster-042632170.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-introduce-its-android-xr-headset-at-a-galaxy-event-on-october-21-230000605.html">is set to officially reveal</a> its long-anticipated Android extended reality (XR) headset, which has been codenamed Project Moohan. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-galaxy-event-worlds-wide-open-a-new-era-of-multimodal-ai">has scheduled a livestream event</a> for October 21 at 10PM ET. That&#39;s just a few hours away, which is pretty much nothing compared to the years of lead-up to this reveal since Samsung and its partners have been teasing this device.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The event will be streamed live via the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">company&#39;s YouTube page</a> and on the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">official Samsung Newsroom site</a>. We don&#39;t know how long the stream will be, but Samsung promises that Project Moohan will open up the &quot;true potential&quot; of mixed-reality devices. You can bookmark this page and watch it right here.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just a reveal for a mixed-reality headset.

Google has also shown previews of the ecosystem at its I/O developer conference before, and while we&#39;ve seen bits and pieces of the software (and hardware) before, the final pieces should be available with the keynote today.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have official specs about the headset itself, but there have been <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">plenty of leaks and rumors</a> that will be confirmed or refuted during the stream. Leaks <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/why-im-so-excited-for-samsung-android-xr-event-and-its-not-just-the-headset/">have suggested</a> it includes a high-end display, advanced tracking and Gemini integration. These same leaks indicate a potential price tag of $1,800 to $2,800, making it more of a rival to the Apple Vision Pro than <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Meta&#39;s new Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is designed to be a showcase for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Android XR</a>, Google&#39;s new AR / VR operating system, but unlike competing mixed reality headsets, Google says there will be few limits on the apps the Galaxy XR will actually be able to run. In fact, a Google spokesperson tells Engadget that &quot;almost all Android apps will automatically be made available without any additional development effort.&quot;</p><p>Obviously, Google and Samsung would love deliberately designed spatial experiences for their new hardware, but almost all existing Android apps, regardless if they were made for phones or not, will be considered &quot;Android XR compatible mobile apps&quot; once the headset launches. That means they&#39;ll run in a floating spatial panel that can be moved around the virtual space surrounding you, and per Google&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/android-xr#android-xr" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Android XR developer guidelines</a>, will automatically support core XR input methods like eye and hand tracking, along with the usual suspects like controllers, mice and keyboards. They should also run and look like they would on a smartphone or tablet. &quot;Apps that specify compact sizes show up accordingly and apps that allow for resizing can be resized in XR. These apps do not run in compatibility mode and won’t be letterboxed,&quot; Google says.</p><p>The only apps that won&#39;t make the cut are ones that require features a given Android XR device doesn&#39;t support, like GPS. And in the case of apps that are already updated to work on large screens, or that are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/adaptiveapps-io25.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">&quot;adaptive apps&quot;</a> designed to reflow and change size depending on the Android device they&#39;re running on, things will be even smoother. Google says adaptive design will be expected to be the default going forward, an effort that started with this year&#39;s release of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-16-is-out-complete-with-new-features-for-pixel-phones-including-live-notification-updates-170006935.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Android 16</a>. “Many APIs restricting size will be ignored on larger screens (which includes Android XR),” Google’s spokesperson said, because the company ultimately wants Android apps to feel responsive whether they’re on a phone, an in-car display or an XR headset.</p><p>Apple tried a similar, but more limited approach with the launch of visionOS and the Vision Pro by letting developers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-apps-will-publish-to-the-apple-vision-pro-store-by-default-183016666.html" data-i13n="slk:list their iOS and iPadOS apps;cpos:5;pos:1">list their iOS and iPadOS apps</a> in the visionOS App Store. The move produced mixed results, and a dearth of real visionOS apps. An app designed with a device in mind is better than one that&#39;s not, but Google does at least appear to have set Android developers up for a slightly smoother ride. Considering the Galaxy XR&#39;s cheaper price when compared to the Vision Pro, they might also have a bigger audience to make apps for, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/why-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-can-support-almost-all-android-apps-021000889.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">Vision Pro</a> was meant to usher in a new era for headsets. However, its high price and somewhat limited utility resulted in what may be the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://macdailynews.com/2025/03/10/the-apple-vision-pro-is-clearly-a-commercial-flop/">biggest</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/story/revisiting-the-three-biggest-flops-of-2024/">flop</a> in years. Now it&#39;s time for Samsung to give things a go with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR</a>. It&#39;s a fresh take on modern mixed reality goggles developed through deep partnerships with Qualcomm and Google and it attempts to address some of the Vision Pro&#39;s biggest shortcomings.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<div id="2d21abadac6841fbb681e3c699ef3e7c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJkbTave_I8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>While both Apple and Samsung&#39;s headsets have a lot of similarities (like their basic design and support for features such as hand and eye tracking), there are also some very important differences. First, at $1,800, the Galaxy XR is essentially half the price of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Vision Pro</a> (including the new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">M5-powered model</a>). Second, instead of Apple’s homegrown OS, Samsung&#39;s headset is the first to run Google&#39;s new Android XR platform, which combines a lot of familiar elements from its mobile counterpart but with a bigger emphasis on AI and Gemini-based voice controls. And third, because Samsung relied more on partners like Google and Qualcomm, the Galaxy XR feels like it&#39;s built around a larger, more open ecosystem that plays nicely with a wider range of third-party devices and software.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy XR fundamentally doesn&#39;t look that much different from the Vision Pro. It features a large visor in front with an assortment of 13 different exterior sensors to support inside-out tracking, passthrough vision and hand recognition. There are some additional sensors inside for eye and face tracking. There&#39;s also a connector for the wire that leads to its external clip-on battery pack alongside built-in speakers with spatial audio. The one big departure is that unlike the Vision Pro, the Galaxy XR doesn&#39;t have an outward-facing display, so it won&#39;t be able to project your face onto the outside of the headset, which is just fine by me.</p>

<p>However, the devil is in the details because while the original Vision Pro weighed between 600 and 650 grams (around 1.3 to 1.4 pounds) depending on the configuration (not including its battery pack), the Galaxy XR is significantly lighter at 545 grams (1.2 pounds). And that&#39;s before you consider the new M5 Vision Pro, which has somehow gone backwards by being even heavier at 750-800 grams (around 1.6 pounds). Furthermore, it seems Samsung learned a lot from its rivals by including a much larger and thicker head cushion that helps distribute the weight of the headset more evenly. Granted, during a longer session, I still noticed a bit of pressure and felt relief after taking off the Galaxy XR, but it&#39;s nothing like the Vision Pro, which in my experience gets uncomfortable almost immediately. Finally, around back, there&#39;s a simple strap with a knob that you can twist to tighten or loosen the headband as necessary. So even without extra support running across the top of your head, getting in and out of the Galaxy XR is much easier and comfier than the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>On the inside, the Galaxy XR is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip with dual micro OLED displays that deliver 4K resolution (3,552 x 3,840) to each eye at up to 90Hz. I wish Samsung was able to go up to a 120Hz refresh rate like on the Vision Pro, but considering the Galaxy XR&#39;s slightly higher overall resolution, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bothered. And I must say, the image quality from this headset is seriously sharp. It&#39;s even better than Apple&#39;s goggles and it might be the best I&#39;ve ever used, particularly outside of $10,000+ enterprise-only setups. Once again, when you consider that this thing costs half the price of a Vision Pro, this headset feels like a real accomplishment by Samsung to the point where I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the company is losing money on every unit it sells.</p>
<p>In terms of longevity, Samsung says that for general use the Galaxy XR should last around two hours. If you&#39;re only watching videos though, that figure is more like two and a half. Thankfully, if you do need to be in mixed reality for longer, you can charge the headset while it&#39;s being used. As for security, the Galaxy XR uses iris recognition to skip traditional passwords, which is nice.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-platform-android-xr">The platform: Android XR</h2>
<p>Sometimes, trying out a new software platform can be a little jarring. But that&#39;s not really the case for Android XR, which shouldn&#39;t present much of a learning curve for anyone who has used other headsets or Google&#39;s ubiquitous mobile OS. After putting the goggles on, you can summon a home menu with an app launcher by facing your palm up and touching your index finger and thumb together. From there, you can open apps and menus by moving your hands and pinching icons or rearranging virtual windows by grabbing the anchor point along the bottom and putting them where you want.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/cbc021e0-aeb7-11f0-b5ff-5f8d009a148d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/cbc021e0-aeb7-11f0-b5ff-5f8d009a148d" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Even without a top strap, the Galaxy XR is surprisingly comfortable thanks to a larger forehead cushion and less weight than the Apple Vision Pro.

<p>Notably, while there is a growing number of new apps made specifically for XR, you still get access to all of your standard Android titles. Those include Google Photos, Google Maps and Youtube, all of which I got a chance to play around with during a 25-minute demo. In Photos, you can browse your pictures normally. However, to take advantage of the Galaxy XR&#39;s hardware, Google created a feature that allows the app to convert standard flat images (with help from the cloud) into immersive ones. While the effect isn&#39;t true 3D, it adds distinct foreground, midground and background layers to images in a way that makes viewing your photo roll just a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>In Maps, you start out with a view of the world before using hand gestures to move and zoom in wherever you want or voice commands to laser in on a specific location. The neat new trick for this app is that if you find bubbles over things like restaurants and stores, you can click those to be transported inside those businesses, where Android XR will stitch together 2D photos to create a simulated 3D environment that you can move and walk around in. Granted, this doesn&#39;t have a ton of practical use for most folks unless you want to take a virtual tour of something like a wedding venue. But, the tech is impressive nonetheless.</p>

Runtime is expected to be about two hours, or two and a half if you are only watching videos. " data-uuid="5dc7ee15-bf61-3d6f-b9ec-05dc4dfb25fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Finally in the YouTube app, the Galaxy XR did a great job of making standard 360 videos look even better. While quality will always depend on the gear that captured the content, viewing spatial clips was a great way to show off its resolution and image quality. Google says it will also put a new tab on the app to make finding 360 videos easier, though you can always watch the billions of standard flat videos as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you can use and navigate the Galaxy XR entirely with hand gestures, but voice commands (via Gemini) are also a major part of the Android XR platform. Because the goggles sit on your head, unlike with mobile devices, there&#39;s no need to use a wake word every time you want to do something. You just talk and Gemini listens (though you can choose to disable this behavior if you prefer), so this makes voice interactions feel a lot more natural. Because Gemini can also do things like adjust settings or organize all the apps you have open, in addition to answering questions, it feels like Google is starting to deliver on some of those Star Trek moments where you can simply ask the computer to do something and it just happens. Yes, it&#39;s still very early, but as a platform, Android XR feels much more like a virtual playground than VisionOS does at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-other-features">Other features</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/4b701ee0-aeb8-11f0-b5ee-e4c5740e114c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/4b701ee0-aeb8-11f0-b5ee-e4c5740e114c" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset has a handy knob for quickly loosening or tightening its headband." data-uuid="88e959cc-83ea-3368-a458-88c518245aca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>While I didn&#39;t get to test these out myself, there are some other important features worth mentioning. In addition to apps, you can also play your standard selection of Android games like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or connect the headset to your PC (like with Steam Link) to play full desktop titles. Furthermore, I was told that the Galaxy XR can be tethered to a computer and used like a traditional VR headset. And while Samsung is making optional wireless controllers for the Galaxy XR (and a big carrying case), you may not need them at all as you&#39;ll also have the ability to pair the goggles with typical Bluetooth-based gamepads along with wireless mice and keyboards.</p>
<p>Google also says it&#39;s working on a new system called Likenesses that can create personalized avatars for use in video calls and meetings that use data from interior sensors to deliver more realistic expressions. Additionally, you&#39;ll be able to use tools like Veo3 to make AI-generated videos while providing prompts using your voice. But this is just scratching the surface of the Galaxy XR&#39;s capabilities and I want to use this thing more before offering a final verdict.</p>

<p>In many ways, the Galaxy XR looks and feels like a flagship mixed reality headset in the same vein as the Vision Pro, but for the Android crowd (and Windows users to some extent as well). On top of that, Google has done some interesting things with Android XR to make it feel like there&#39;s a much wider range of content and software to view and use. In many ways, the addition of a dedicated AI assistant in Gemini and voice controls feels much more impactful on goggles than a phone because you can&#39;t always count on having physical inputs like a mouse or keyboard. And with the Galaxy XR being half the price of the Vision Pro, Samsung and Google have done a lot to address some of the most glaring issues with Apple&#39;s rival.</p>
<p>In case the price drop wasn&#39;t enough, it feels like all the companies involved are doing as much as possible to sweeten the deal. I actually started laughing when I first heard all the discounts and free subscriptions that come with the headset. That&#39;s because in addition to the goggles themselves, every Galaxy XR will come with what&#39;s being called the Explorer Pack: 12 months of access to Google AI Pro, 12 months of YouTube Premium (which itself includes YouTube Music), 12 months of Google Play Pass, 12 Months of NBA League Pass and a bundle of other custom XR content and apps. So on top of a slick design, top-tier optics and a new platform, Google and Samsung are basically tossing a kitchen sink of apps and memberships in with the headset.</p>

<p>My only reservation is that when it comes to mass adoption, I think smartglasses have supplanted headsets as the next big mainstream play. Granted, there is a lot of technology and software shared between both categories of devices (Google has already teased upcoming Android XR smartglasses) that should allow Samsung or Google to pivot more easily down the line. But the idea that in the future there will be a headset in every home seems less likely every day. Still, as a showcase for the potential of mixed reality and high-end optics, the Galaxy XR is an exciting piece of tech.</p>

Costing just over half as much as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">Apple&#39;s reality machine</a>, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html">Galaxy XR</a> has a 4K micro-OLED screen and a 100-degree horizontal field of view. The $1,800 mixed reality headset is available now for pre-order on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung&#39;s website</a>.</p>
<p>The Galaxy XR isn&#39;t <em>only</em> a Samsung product. The company developed the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">long-rumored headset</a> alongside Google and Qualcomm. It&#39;s the first Android XR product, a line that will eventually include AI glasses &quot;and beyond.&quot; You can read more about the headset and its ecosystem in Engadget&#39;s news coverage.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><core-commerce id="1a1e453a8c324e18835d035512cc802f" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Given Google&#39;s connection to the Galaxy XR, it isn&#39;t too surprising that the company has bonuses for early orders. If you buy the headset before the end of 2025, you&#39;ll get &quot;The Explorer Pack.&quot; That includes a year of access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium and Google Play Pass. Also included until the end of the year is the &quot;XR Pack.&quot; This adds three months of YouTube TV, a year of NBA League Pass, NFL Pro Era, Adobe&#39;s Project Pulsar, Asteroid and Calm.</p>
<p>You can order the Galaxy XR now from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung&#39;s website</a> and in Samsung Experience Stores. The headset costs $1,800. An optional Galaxy XR Controller costs $250. And somehow, the official Galaxy XR travel case also costs $250, which is — <em>yikes</em> — a lot. Perhaps consider waiting for third-party alternatives on the case front.</p>
<p>Samsung is offering a 24-month financing plan for the headset ($75.01 monthly) on its website. Meanwhile, Samsung&#39;s stores have that plan as well as a 12-month one ($149 monthly).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-order-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-020008173.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've known for a while that the first <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html">extended reality (or XR) headset</a> from Samsung and Google would debut in 2025. During <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/how-to-watch-samsung-unveil-its-android-xr-headset-184820772.html">an event on Tuesday night</a>, Samsung at long last shared more details about the first <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html">Android XR</a> device that you'll be able to purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company got really wild and original with the headset's name. You're truly not going to believe what it's called... Actually, it's got the most unsurprising name of all time: <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR</a>. What's more, you can <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=60780373-867a-4d35-9679-5a7dbd04ec1a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=buy+the+headset+right+now&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYwNzgwMzczLTg2N2EtNGQzNS05Njc5LTVhN2RiZDA0ZWMxYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUOS1LSpsSw51OEhe8g8xYCLMMzTx57wN70Ur347mc-R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/">buy the headset right now</a> in the US and Korea for $1,800. That's just over half of what the Apple Vision Pro costs.</p>

<p>Aside from an Android-powered headset that looks very much like an Apple Vision Pro, you might be wondering exactly what you'll be getting in return for forking over 1,800 smackeroos. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">As expected</a>, Galaxy XR is powered by the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset. Qualcomm worked with Samsung and Google on the headset.</p>
<p>The micro OLED display has 29 million pixels (6 million more than the Apple Vision Pro), a resolution of 3,552 x 3,840 and 96 percent of the DCI‑P3 color gamut — four percent more than the Vision Pro. Where Apple does have Samsung beat on the display front is with the refresh rate: the Galaxy XR tops out at 90Hz and the Vision Pro can hit 120Hz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Galaxy XR has dual high-res passthrough cameras to support mixed reality use, six other external cameras for tracking things in the environment and two eye-tracking sensors. The device supports iris recognition for unlocking the headset and entering passwords in some apps. As with the Vision Pro, you can capture 3D photos and video using the headset.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/5bf711b0-aea9-11f0-b7fa-d4a3d3eb61e4" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/5bf711b0-aea9-11f0-b7fa-d4a3d3eb61e4" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="A look at the Galaxy XR headset from behind, with the device's optical lenses shown." data-uuid="05e6c9f7-ee43-3637-aa53-195be4bcf82a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The cameras allow for hand tracking and gesture control, though it's possible to operate Galaxy XR with physical controllers as well. If you prefer, you can pair a keyboard and mouse to the headset or link it to your PC and access your desktop that way.</p>
<p>The dual speakers support Dolby Atmos and there are six microphones built in. As for battery life, Samsung says you'll get up to two hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback on a charge. That matches the original battery life promises of the original Vision Pro, but Apple said its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">latest model</a> (which has the new M5 chipset) offers an extra 30 minutes or so of usage.</p>
<p>The interpupillary distance of the Galaxy XR's optics is 54~70mm, and it's possible to buy insertable prescription lenses if needed. As for connectivity, the headset supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. Even with a forehead cushion attached, Galaxy XR weighs 545g (1.2lbs), while the latest Apple Vision Pro has a minimum weight of 750g (1.7lbs). The Galaxy XR's battery pack — as with competitor's offerings, the battery is external — weighs 302g (0.7lbs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung claims the Galaxy XR was designed with comfort in mind. "The headset’s ergonomically balanced frame distributes pressure across the forehead and the back of the head, minimizing facial discomfort while providing steady support," the company said in a press release. There's also a detachable light shield that you can employ to block out external light.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-you-can-actually-do-with-galaxy-xr"><strong>What you can actually do with Galaxy XR</strong></h2>
<p>There are no prizes for guessing that Google's generative AI chatbot Gemini is at the heart of Android XR. "Android XR is the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era, and we are incredibly excited to take a significant leap forward today with the launch of Galaxy XR," Sameer Samat, Google's president of Android Ecosystem, said.</p>
<p>Every Google Play Store app works out of the box on the headset, though of course Google has reworked some for mixed reality. You can use Gemini to navigate Google Maps and ask for personalized recommendations while checking out 3D visuals with <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-adding-gemini-ai-powered-tools-to-maps-140045971.html">Immersive View</a>. Google Photos can bring an extra dimension to 2D photos and videos via auto spatialization.</p>
<p>On YouTube, you can ask Gemini to find videos and tell you more details about what you're watching. And, while using the passthrough mode, you can look at any object in your environment and use Circle to Search to look up more info about it. Google has also made new versions of Google TV, Chrome and Meet (because what is mixed reality for if not conference calls?) for Android XR.</p>
<p>Multitasking is a factor here as well. The operating system allows users to have multiple, resizable apps open at once. These can be arranged in a virtual space, or you can simply ask Gemini to do that for you.</p>
<p>On the entertainment front, you'll be able to stream shows and movies in 4K in a virtual theater setting. You'll have access to a library of 180-degree and 360-degree VR content, and you can view 3D content via a "spatial" tab. Some streaming platforms have reworked their apps for Android XR, including Crunchyroll, HBO Max and Peacock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a multi-view option for watching sports, with apps from the likes of MLB and Fox Sports available. With Adobe's Project Pulsar (an immersive video editing app), you'll be able to add 3D depth to videos and seemingly place captions behind subjects with ease, if that's something you're interested in.</p>

<p>Galaxy XR has games too. <em>NFL Pro Era </em>— an NFL-licensed virtual reality title that's also on Meta Quest, PlayStation VR and Windows — is available for Android XR. So too is <em>Inside [JOB]</em> by Owlchemy Labs (<em>Vacation Simulator, Job Simulator</em>). For compatible games, Samsung says Gemini can offer real-time coaching, tips and "enhanced gameplay experiences."</p>
<p>The arrival of Galaxy XR is an important next step for Google and its grand vision of an Android XR ecosystem. But the company isn't stopping with headsets. It's also making smart glasses, a product category that Meta has been trying to conquer. Samsung and Google are working with Warby Parker on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-demos-android-xr-glasses-at-io-live-translation-191510280.html">Android XR smart glasses</a>. At I/O earlier this year, we got some hands-on time with a prototype of <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-xr-glasses-hands-on-lightweight-but-with-a-limited-field-of-view-213940554.html">Google's Android XR glasses</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR will run you $1,800</a>, and Samsung is offering financing options. The Galaxy XR Travel Case and Galaxy XR Controller will each run you $250 — at those prices, they almost need financing options too. Ouch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who buys Galaxy XR by the end of this year will get an Explorer Pack at no extra cost. This includes 12 months of access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium and Google Play Pass. The <em>NFL Pro Era</em>, Project Pulsar, Calm and Asteroid apps are bundled in too. You'll also get NBA League Pass access for the 2025-26 season in the US or 12 months of the Coupang Play Sports Pass in Korea. Charging $1 for each of the first three months of YouTube TV seems a little cheap considering the outlay for Galaxy XR, but it's still a decent perk. YouTube TV typically costs $83 per month.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html?src=rss]]></description>

The camera is an update on a previous design that could capture footage at one billion frames per second, but it comes with a major caveat: it can only shoot one pixel at a time.</p><p>Haidet&#39;s camera is made from a gimbal-mounted mirror, two tubes, a simple lens, a light sensor and some Python code to tie it all together. Pointed at a laser pointer, the camera&#39;s able to capture a beam of light at two billion frames per second, showing it smoothly traveling between mirrors, with speeds that vary depending on where the camera is in relation to the laser pointer. &quot;Light moves about six inches, or 15 centimeters, per frame of this video,&quot; Haidet says. &quot;This beam of light is traveling at the Universe’s speed limit. Light in any reference frame will never move any faster or any slower than this speed.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/A_laser_pointer_at_2_billion_fps_makes_the_speed_of_light_look..._kinda_weird_4-46_screenshot.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/A_laser_pointer_at_2_billion_fps_makes_the_speed_of_light_look..._kinda_weird_4-46_screenshot.png" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Brian Haidet explaining how he tiled pixels together to create footage of light traveling." data-uuid="360225ce-322c-44b6-a3bd-5982e6a2750d"><figcaption>Pixels had to be tiled together to create what looks like normal video footage.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Brian Hadet</div></figure><p>While it&#39;s theoretically possible to create a more traditional camera that can capture footage at two billion frames per second, as Haidet explains, you can&#39;t do it with the tools most people have in their garage. His solution was to capture one pixel at a time, and then tile that footage together to create something viewable. According to Haidet, &quot;if all these videos are synchronized and we take many, many, many, one pixel videos, we can tile these videos next to each other and play them all back at the exact same moment and give something that looks like a video.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While it&#39;s not the same thing as a true two billion frames-per-second camera, &quot;that&#39;s just a significantly more expensive way to do it,&quot; Haidet says, &quot;and it really wouldn&#39;t get us any better of a result.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/someone-made-a-camera-that-can-shoot-at-two-billion-frames-per-second-202259391.html?src=rss]]></description>

A Los Angeles judge ruled that the three men will need to testify in the trial set to begin in January, <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/meta-instagram-snap-social-media-child-safety.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">according to</a> <em>CNBC</em>.</p><p>&quot;The testimony of a CEO is uniquely relevant, as that officer’s knowledge of harms, and failure to take available steps to avoid such harms could establish negligence or ratification of negligent conduct,” Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl wrote. As <em>CNBC</em> points out, the January trial will be closely watched as it&#39;s the first of many lawsuits alleging harms to young social media users that will head to trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Lawyers for Meta and Snap had argued that the executives should be spared from testifying at the upcoming trial. Meta&#39;s lawyers reportedly argued that forcing testimony from Zuckerberg and Mosseri would &quot;set a precedent&quot; for future trials.

In a statement, the law firm representing Snap said that the judge&#39;s order &quot;does not bear at all on the validity of Plaintiffs claims&quot; and that they &quot;look forward to the opportunity to explain why Plaintiffs&#39; allegations against Snapchat are wrong factually and as a matter of law. &quot;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-adam-mosseri-and-evan-spiegel-ordered-to-testify-in-trial-over-social-media-addiction-190500907.html?src=rss]]></description>

This week the UK government issued new guidance backing headteachers in prohibiting the use of mobile phones throughout the school day, including at break times. Many schools around the country are already prohibiting mobile phone use over concerns. The amount of time children spend on screens each day rocketed during the Covid pandemic by more than 50 per cent, the equivalent of an extra hour and twenty minutes. Researchers say that unmoderated screen time can have long-lasting effects on a child&#39;s mental and physical health. Recently TikTok announced that every account belonging to a user below age 18 have a 60-minute daily screen time limit automatically set. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)]]></media:description>

While the streamer has primarily specialized video game adaptations, the belief in post-<em>Barbie</em> Hollywood is that any recognizable IP could be the source of a future TV show or movie.</p><p>In <em>Catan</em>, players are tasked with collecting resources and building out a civilization on a remote island, with multiple ways to win or obstruct fellow players from doing the same. It&#39;s not too hard to imagine the game being converted into some kind of competitive reality TV show, though apparently animated and live-action narrative<em> </em>projects are also on the table. &quot;Anyone who has played <em>Catan</em> knows [that] the intense strategy and negotiation at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,&quot; Jinny Howe, Netflix&#39;s head of scripted series for the US and Canada, shared in the press release announcing the deal.</p><p>Whichever <em>Catan</em> project ultimately heads into production, Netflix says it&#39;ll be produced by Darren Kyman from Asmodee, Pete Fenlon from Catan Studio, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber, the sons of <em>Catan</em> creator Klaus Teuber. If Asmodee sounds familiar, it might be because Netflix has partnered with the publisher in the past. <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, another Asmodee published game, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/monopoly-netflix-game-show-bake-off-1236556296/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">was adapted</a> into both a mobile game for Netflix Games and an animated series with the help of its original creators.</p><p><em>Catan</em> joins <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/monopoly-netflix-game-show-bake-off-1236556296/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a <em>Monopoly</em> adaptation</a> and several shows based on video games at Netflix, including the recently released <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-animated-series-arrives-on-october-14-145632934.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></a> and an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-takes-a-leap-of-faith-on-an-assassins-creed-series-153958591.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">upcoming series</a> based on the Assassin&#39;s Creed franchise.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-adapting-catan-into-movies-and-tv-shows-185133712.html?src=rss]]></description>

The decision was made due to slowing demand in the EV market, as hundreds of Brightdrop vans <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:USA TODAY;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4c97c3fe-896f-4ba9-9311-97cca850ce43&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=USA+TODAY&amp;linkText=have+begun+piling+up+in+dealer+lots&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyNS8wMy8yOS9nbS1zdG9yaW5nLWVsZWN0cmljLXZhbnMtbWljaGlnYW4vODI3MDA5NDEwMDcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0Yzk3YzNmZS04OTZmLTRiYTktOTMxMS05N2NjYTg1MGNlNDMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI1LzAzLzI5L2dtLXN0b3JpbmctZWxlY3RyaWMtdmFucy1taWNoaWdhbi84MjcwMDk0MTAwNy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASdNoUUDr4GsssGPwVD0lFmE3oNPOKCrhlRbaKBRTYLU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fbusiness%2F2025%2F03%2F29%2Fgm-storing-electric-vans-michigan%2F82700941007%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2025/03/29/gm-storing-electric-vans-michigan/82700941007/">have begun piling up in dealer lots</a>.</p>
<p>“This is not a decision we made lightly because of the impact on our employees,” CEO Mary Barra said in the earnings call. “However the commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected, and changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives has made the business even more challenging.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those changes to the regulatory framework she mentions likely refer to the recent disappearance of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html">federal EV tax credit</a>. The policy offered prospective buyers a $7,500 tax credit and was supposed to wind down in 2032, but the Trump administration killed it back in September as part of the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill. Brightdrop vans were also eligible for a $7,500 rebate for commercial EVs under 18,000 lbs, which went away along with the tax credit.</p>
<p>In other words, Brightdrop electric vans are simply too expensive for most consumers. They started at $74,000. The double discount brought the starting price down to $59,000, but that&#39;s gone now. Additionally, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-van-143144512.html">rival Ford&#39;s E-Transit van</a> starts at $51,600.</p>

<p>GM first launched the Brightdrop vans back in 2021, and this seemed to be a serious attempt to capture the commercial EV market. The company made its own <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-truck-ep1-delivery-business-fedex-153325067.html">fleet management software</a>  and inked deals with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-gm-brighdrop-ev-order-193935301.html">Walmart</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fedex-gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-vans-140050680.html">FedEx</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-will-buy-175000-e-vs-from-gm-over-the-next-five-years-173032998.html">others</a>. Money is money, however, and not too many commercial customers have an extra $15,000 laying around to make up for those lapsed credits and rebates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/gm-to-end-production-of-its-chevy-brightdrop-electric-vans-183622673.html?src=rss]]></description>

To participate, people will need to submit a government ID and a brief video selfie to YouTube to ensure they are who they say they are and give the feature source material to draw from in its review.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s war of words with Europe over its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> is bleeding into the court system. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/apple-attacks-eu-crackdown-in-digital-law-s-biggest-court-test">reports</a> that the company criticized the regulations at the General Court in Luxembourg. The European Commission is currently <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/consultation-first-review-digital-markets-act-2025-07-03_en">conducting</a> its first formal review of the law. Apple lawyer Daniel Beard told the court reviewing the DMA that it &quot;imposes hugely onerous and intrusive burdens.&quot;</p>
<p>The language echoes Apple&#39;s go-to framing of the regulations as an anti-consumer, anti-privacy hardship on the nearly $4 trillion company. &quot;Over time, it&#39;s become clear that the DMA isn&#39;t helping markets,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/the-digital-markets-acts-impacts-on-eu-users/">wrote</a> in a September blog post. &quot;It&#39;s making it harder to do business in Europe.&quot; Apple even cited porn as one of the law&#39;s alleged dangers. &quot;For the first time, pornography apps are available on iPhone from other marketplaces — apps we&#39;ve never allowed on the App Store because of the risks they create, especially for children.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also claimed the DMA caused it to delay several features. These include <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-use-live-translation-with-airpods-144837882.html">AirPods Live Translation</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-mirror-your-iphone-on-macos-sequoia-130003743.html">iPhone Mirroring in macOS</a>, and the Visited Places and Preferred Routes features in Maps.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-repeats-its-long-held-criticism-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-130058440.html">asked the EC to repeal the law</a> in September. In response, the commission essentially <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-tells-apple-it-has-no-intention-of-repealing-the-digital-markets-act-175950691.html">told the company to shove it</a>. &quot;Apple has simply contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application,&quot; EU spokesperson Thomas Regnier said. He added that the EC had &quot;absolutely no intention&quot; of ditching the law.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Apple is challenging the DMA on three fronts. First is its requirement that <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eu-gives-apple-six-months-to-make-cross-device-interoperability-easier-140030456.html">rival hardware (like earbuds and smartwatches) work with the iPhone</a>, which Apple claims is a security risk. The company also objected to <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-app-store-rules-are-still-in-violation-of-eu-policy-161117662.html">the App Store&#39;s inclusion under the rules</a> and a probe into whether iMessage should have been included.</p>
<p>In response, EC lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal highlighted Apple&#39;s immense power in Europe. He said the company&#39;s &quot;absolute control&quot; over the iPhone has led to &quot;supernormal profits&quot; in markets where competitors can&#39;t possibly compete on equal footing.</p>
<p>&quot;Only Apple has the keys to that walled garden,&quot; Loewenthal told the court. &quot;It decides who gets it and who can offer their products and services to iPhone users. And through such control, Apple has locked in more than a third of European smartphone users.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-steps-up-its-attacks-on-europes-dma-regulations-175332390.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI&#39;s long-rumored browser has a name, and you can try it out today — provided you&#39;re an Apple user. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://chatgpt.com/atlas">ChatGPT Atlas</a> is available to download on macOS, with the company promising to bring it to Windows, Android and iOS soon. Atlas integrates ChatGPT directly within the browser interface, allowing users to engage with the chatbot while they&#39;re surfing the web — no need to jump between different tabs or copy and paste content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you select a text field, an icon will appear that allows you to prompt ChatGPT. OpenAI demoed this feature in Gmail where an employee asked the chatbot to polish an email he was writing to a colleague. Naturally, a prompt bar will also appear when you open a new tab, and you can open a sidebar where you can converse with ChatGPT at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2cc92e9a7ed4414aa82a07d7045a1a4a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej6hnsQgV_c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>The more you use Atlas, the more ChatGPT will &quot;remember&quot; about your preferences. One of the benefits of this is that you&#39;ll be able to more easily filter through your search history. For instance, you can write &quot;re-open the shoes I looked at yesterday,&quot; and ChatGPT will know the specific website you want to look at again. Browser memories are optional, and if you decide to enable the feature, you can manage them through the settings menu, and just like any other browser, you can delete your history or go surf the web using an incognito mode. OpenAI also says it won&#39;t use the content users browse to train its future models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atlas also includes an agent mode where ChatGPT can surf the web for you and complete tasks. The feature builds on the Operator tech <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-operator-can-surf-the-web-for-you-210029243.html">debuted at the start of the year</a>, and is currently available as a preview within the browser that Plus, Pro and Business accounts can try out. &quot;It can help you book reservations or flights or even just edit a document that you’re working on,” said Adam Fry, product lead for ChatGPT Search, during the livestream where OpenAI announced Atlas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Tabs are great but we haven&#39;t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,&quot; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the start of the livestream. “This is just a great browser all-around — it’s smooth, it’s quick, it’s really nice to use.”</p>
<p>Rumors that OpenAI was working on its own web browser first surfaced in July. With today&#39;s announcement, the company joins an already competitive market. A number of companies, including <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/operas-new-fully-agentic-browser-can-surf-the-web-for-you-145035874.html">Opera</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-is-available-now-for-200-per-month-180955616.html">Perplexity</a>, released their own &quot;agentic&quot; browsers earlier this year.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi-wireless/ai-updates-auto-connect-bill-summaries/"><ins>just announced several updates</ins></a> for its digital telecom provider, Google Fi. It&#39;s introducing AI-enhanced audio for better sound quality during calls. The company says this will ensure &quot;optimized audio quality for every call, so you can confidently take calls from a windy park or busy cafe.&quot; This feature rolls out sometime in November.</p>
<p>Google Fi is getting HD/HD+ calling, which should also improve the overall audio quality. The service will soon automatically connect to Wi-Fi when available, with the company touting &quot;seamless, secure switching.&quot; As for security, each call and text goes through a VPN. There&#39;s no extra cost for this service and it doesn&#39;t count against the pre-existing data allocation.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform will also soon let users make calls and send texts from any web browser. This is coming in December and will feature a new interface with full RCS support, allowing folks to add hi-res photos and videos to message threads.</p>
<p>Finally, Google is integrating Gemini into the platform to create an AI-powered billing summary. The company says this offers &quot;simple, easy explanations of all your billing statements.&quot; The feature has been in a beta for a while and Google says users have given it &quot;high positive sentiment.&quot;</p>
<p>These tools are accompanied by a limited-time promo for new subscribers, amounting to 50 percent off for 15 months when bringing in a phone. The discount is only available for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=307dcc7c-5375-42e1-b3c1-4cab0a845e00&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Unlimited+Premium+and+Unlimited+Standard+plans&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2ZpLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vYWJvdXQvcGxhbnMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwN2RjYzdjLTUzNzUtNDJlMS1iM2MxLTRjYWIwYTg0NWUwMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9maS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2Fib3V0L3BsYW5zIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaQAUYHFAhrkxqXsoXhaLypBvcaFVa9aQRu8fOz4T8eU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffi.google.com%2Fabout%2Fplans" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://fi.google.com/about/plans"><ins>Unlimited Premium and Unlimited Standard plans</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-fi-will-start-using-ai-to-make-calls-sound-better-170025805.html?src=rss]]></description>

But while the new 14-inch MacBook Pro appears to be more of the same on the surface, it also features an impressive graphics upgrade that makes it a decent choice for gaming. And it retains everything I already love about the MacBook Pro: It's still a well-designed machine that's sturdy, fast and offers tons of battery life.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-whats-new-in-the-m5-macbook-pro"><strong>What's new in the M5 MacBook Pro</strong></h2> 
<p>The star of the show is Apple's new M5 chip, which sports a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU and 16 Neural Engine cores. While the company claims it's 20 percent faster than the M4 for multi-threaded applications, the biggest upgrade is the GPU, which is up to 60 percent faster when it comes to games and professional apps. The <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-and-16-inch-review-2024-brace-yourself-for-m4-speed-140057584.html">M4 was no slouch</a> when it came to gaming and media rendering, but the M5 is a more tempting upgrade for anyone using an M1 MacBook Pro or older.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="74eccb67-af38-40fb-b70f-e884923a718b" /> 
<p>Otherwise, it's like I said: more of the same. There's the 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display which offers up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits of HDR, as well as ProMotion’s smooth 120Hz refresh rate. (Unfortunately, we’ll likely have to wait until next year for an OLED option.) The aluminum case is still rock solid, and the excellent keyboard and trackpad haven't changed a bit. Last year's 12MP Center Stage webcam also makes a return, along with the superb six-speaker sound system.</p> 
<p>The port situation is also solid. On top of the MagSafe 3 charging connection, there are three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a full-sized SDXC card reader, HDMI and a headphone jack. (It would be nice to see a gigabit Ethernet port though. That's the one accessory I still regularly connect to almost every laptop.)</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-in-use-the-best-gets-even-better"><strong>In use: The best gets even better</strong></h2> 
<p>Before I get to the benchmarks and other performance metrics, it's worth pointing out just how pleasant the 14-inch MacBook is to use. Its aluminum frame is smooth to the touch, its screen is bright enough to use in direct sunlight and it always feels blazing fast. While its 3.4-pound frame is noticeably heavier than the 2.7-pound MacBook Air, it's still easy to travel with. And you can certainly tell that the additional weight translates into raw power, especially as you start to stress the MacBook Pro and hear its fans gently spin up. While the MacBook Air is built to be as thin as possible, the MacBook Pro is built to get work done (and look good while doing so).</p> 
<p>Based on my testing with popular benchmarks and a few games, the M5 MacBook Pro is noticeably faster than the M4 model in tasks that rely on the GPU and NPU. Otherwise, though, it's hard to tell a difference when it comes to basic tasks like booting into macOS, browsing the web and dealing with email. My review unit was equipped with 32GB of RAM, so it had a bit more breathing room than the base model with 16GB of memory. (Pro tip: If you're planning to keep the MacBook Pro for four years or more, it makes sense to get at least 32GB of RAM. You can't upgrade the memory down the line like older laptops, since it's baked directly into the M5 chip.)</p>

<p>In Geekbench 6, the M5 MacBook Pro was around 500 points faster than the M4 model in single-threaded tasks, and nearly 3,500 points faster for complex multi-threaded work like video rendering. Thanks to the M5's new graphics hardware, it also tested far better in the Geekbench 6 GPU test, reaching around 11,00 points faster than the M4. I noticed a similar result in Cinebench 2024: The M5 MacBook Pro's CPU scores were slightly better than before, but the GPU score was nearly twice as fast as the M4.</p> 
<p>For real-world gaming performance, I turned to <em>Lies of P</em>, which also surprised me with some major leaps. With the M4 MacBook Pro, I could only get a steady 60 fps with the highest graphics settings in 1080p. With this M5 model, I was able to play at the highest resolution (3024 by 1890) between 70 and 75 fps. It was even smoother as I scaled down the resolution: The MacBook Pro hit 85 to 95 fps in 1,440p and up to 140 fps in 1080p. Those results are in line with what I'd expect from a gaming notebook that costs well over $2,000, which is in line with the $2,200 retail cost of our review unit.</p>

<p>I still wouldn't recommend a MacBook Pro for anyone who wants to play tons of games, but it's heartening to see Apple making progress on that front. There are more new AAA games hitting the app store, and the M-series chips are fast enough to run most of them well. But the M5 is the first time I'd consider Apple's hardware equivalent to a PC running a video card like NVIDIA's RTX 5070.</p> 
<p>The M5 MacBook Pro retains the impressive battery life from the previous model, reaching 34 hours and 30 minutes while looping an HD video. I could also use it for more than two full days of work with nothing much stressing the GPU. And once again, the MacBook Pro never feels very hot, even under an intensive workload. The fans are audible, but they don’t get as annoying as the helicopter-like fans from the old Intel MacBook Pros.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-should-you-buy-the-m5-macbook-pro"><strong>Should you buy the M5 MacBook Pro?</strong></h2> 
<p>If you're looking for a powerful laptop that can handle most heavy-duty workloads, the MacBook Pro will certainly suit your needs. But the difficult choice now is deciding between this 14-inch M5 model, the existing M4 Pro and Max systems, or waiting a few months for the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. If you're rendering video and 3D content all day, you're likely better off working with Pro and Max chips, but you'll have to wait several months to see the new M5 options. If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip). But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>As you can probably guess from its name, Baseus’ power bank has a 5,000mAh capacity and is Qi2-certified. In our testing. It gave our tester iPhone 15 a 43 percent bump in battery in 42 minutes, which returned the phone to 91 percent. It has a curved design and is wrapped in soft silicone, making it easy to grip in a pinch.</p> 
<p>As a reminder, MagSafe charging is supported on iPhone 12 models and later, though you’ll need an iPhone 13 or later to reach the 15W charging speed on a third-party Qi2 accessory such as the one featured in this deal.</p>

The company says it's the "thinnest e-paper frame available" that is "designed to join a gallery wall or stand alone." Aura isn't kidding here. This thing is just 0.6-inches thick.</p> 
<p>One of the primary pain points of traditional digital photo frames is that many require constant power via an outlet. This creates an aesthetic problem, as one has to figure out a place to tuck away a power cord. Some modern frames operate via battery, but they don't last all that long.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Aura Ink, however, features a rechargeable battery that powers the device for three full months. That's a really good metric and is likely due to the decreased power demands of e-ink.</p> 
<p>There's another problem that Aura looks to have solved here. Color e-paper has a limited palette with access to just six different hues. That's just the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/tech/detail/How_it_works">nature of the technology</a>. This doesn't always make for the most pristine images.</p> 
<p>The company is getting around this limitation via a proprietary dithering algorithm that "expands the appearance of the display’s six-color ink system into millions of tones, creating the illusion of full-color photographs."

<p>There's also an integrated front light that highlights photos. The company says this light has been designed to boost contract and automatically adjusts to ambient conditions. It also shuts off at night because the opposite would be kind of creepy.</p> 
<p>The Aura Ink ships with a wall-mount and a tabletop stand. Now onto the bad news. This is high-end technology with a high-end price tag. The frame costs $500. Aura is a reputable company, however, as its Carver Mat model topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-digital-frame-120046051.html">best digital picture frames</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It felt like half of the internet was dealing with a severe hangover on October 20. A severe Amazon Web Services outage took out many, many websites, apps, games and other services that rely on Amazon’s cloud division to stay up and running. That included a long list of popular software like Venmo, Snapchat, Canva and <em>Fortnite</em>. Even Amazon's own assistant Alexa stuttered, and if you were wondering why the internet seemed to be against you — you weren't imagining it. The good news is that, Amazon <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">announced</a> by 6:53PM ET on October 20 that it resolved the "increased error rates and latencies for AWS Services."</p>
<p>The company said it "identified the trigger of the event as DNS resolution issues for the regional DynamoDB service endpoints." It ran into more problems as it tried to solve the outage, but it was eventually able to fix everything. "By 3:01 PM [PT], all AWS services returned to normal operations," it said.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At about 4:30PM ET on October 20, things seemed to be returning back to normal. Apps like Venmo and Lyft, which were either slow to respond or completely nonresponsive before, were appearing to behave smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of 1:15PM ET on October 20, multiple services were unavailable, including asking Alexa for the weather or to turn off lights in your home. The Lyft app was also slower to respond than usual, and Venmo transactions were not completing.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS service health page</a> at the time, Amazon was looking into "increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services" in the US-EAST-1 region (i.e. data centers in Northern Virginia) as of 3:11AM ET on Monday. By 5:01AM, AWS had figured out that a DNS resolution issue with its DynamoDB API was the cause of the outage. DynamoDB is a database that holds info for AWS clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At about 12:08PM ET, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-service-disruptions-outage-update">posted a small statement</a> that reiterated the above and added that the "underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT." According to the notice, some Amazon "customers still continue to experience increased error rates with AWS services in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region due to issues with launching new EC2 instances." Amazon also said Amazon.com and Amazon subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer service support operations have been impacted.</p>
<p>“Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data,” Mike Chapple, a teaching professor of IT, analytics and operations at University of Notre Dame, told <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/amazon-tech-outage-10-20-25-intl?post-id=cmgz331910000356o8os98qu2"><em>CNN</em></a>. “It’s as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia.”</p>
<p>As of 6:35AM, AWS said it had fully mitigated the DNS issue and that "most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now." However, the knock-on effect caused issues with other AWS services, including EC2, a virtual machine service on which many companies build online applications.</p>
<p>At 8:48AM, AWS said it was "making progress on resolving the issue with new EC2 instance launches in the US-EAST-1 Region." It recommended that clients not tie new deployments to specific Availability Zones (i.e. one or more data centers in a given region) "so that EC2 has flexibility" in picking a zone that may be a better option.</p>
<p>At 9:42AM, Amazon noted on the status page that although it had applied "multiple mitigations" across several Availability Zones in US-EAST-1, it was "still experiencing elevated errors for new EC2 instance launches." As such, AWS was "rate limiting new instance launches to aid recovery." The company added at 10:14AM that it was seeing "significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region." Even once all the issues are resolved, AWS will have a significant backlog of requests and other factors to process, so it'll take some time for everything to recover.</p>
<p>Many, many, many companies use US-EAST-1 for their AWS deployments, which is why it felt like half of the internet was knocked offline on Monday morning. As of mid-morning, tons of websites and other services were sluggish or offering up error messages. Outage reports for a broad swathe of services spiked on Down Detector. Along with Amazon's own services, users reported issues with the likes of banks, airlines, Disney+, Snapchat, Reddit, Lyft, Apple Music, Pinterest, <em>Fortnite, Roblox </em>and <em>The New York Times </em>— sorry to anyone whose <em>Wordle</em> streaks may be at risk.</p>
<p>Sites like Reddit have posted their <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.redditstatus.com/">own status updates</a>, and though they don't explicitly mention AWS, it's possible that the services' paths may cross somewhere in the pipelines.</p>
<p>AWS offers a lot of useful features to clients, such as the ability for websites and apps to automatically scale compute and server capacity up and down as needed to handle ebbs and flows in traffic. It also has data centers around the world. That kind of infrastructure is attractive to companies that serve a global  audience and need to stay online around the clock. As of mid-2025, it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">estimated</a> that AWS' share of the worldwide cloud infrastructure market was 30 percent. But incidents such as this highlight that relying on just a few providers to be the backbone of much of the internet is a bit of a problem.</p>

<p>The company also says the stream will be a full hour, which is a heck of a long time to spend on just one game a few weeks before launch. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a Masahiro Sakurai title.</p>

<p>This is the guy that made the Super Smash Bros. franchise. He loves making long videos about minutiae in his games. Just about every character on the <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> roster got a fairly substantial reveal video and he has made <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en/search?query=smash"><ins>all kinds of content</ins></a> about the various mechanics on that game.</p>
<p>To that end, the previous <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-nintendo-direct-focused-on-kirby-air-riders-is-set-for-august-19-134353712.html"><ins>livestream from August</ins></a> was 45 minutes long and included a fairly deep dive into game mechanics. We don&#39;t know what this stream will spotlight but we can&#39;t wait to find out.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a Switch 2 exclusive that stars the lovable and eternally-hungry puffball Kirby. It&#39;s a racing game and a follow-up to the Gamecube original, <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>. It&#39;ll be available on November 20.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/theres-another-kirby-air-riders-direct-livestream-on-october-23-at-9am-et-150344862.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is reportedly moving towards an era of unprecedented automation that would put half a million jobs in the US at risk. According to a series of interviews and internal documents referenced in an extensive report from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Amazon executives expect to sell twice as many products by 2033. But by scaling up its robotics operations believe it could avoid the 600,000 hires it would otherwise have to make to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>According to the report, documents show that the ultimate aim of Amazon’s in-house robotics department is to automate 75 percent of all operations, and if it is successful in making 160,000 fewer hires by 2027, the company would reportedly save 30 cents on each item it packs and delivers to customers in the US. Amazon recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-million-robots-ai-foundation-model"><ins>celebrated deploying</ins></a> its 1 millionth robot, a fleet it has been adding to since unveiling its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/proteus-amazon-first-fully-autonomous-warehouse-robot-074341277.html"><ins>first</ins></a> fully autonomous mobile robot in 2022.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite already pushing ahead with building warehouses that employ few humans, the<em> NYT </em>report claims that Amazon is planning for the eventual impact on affected communities and the potential backlash by participating in local events to establish a reputation as a &quot;good corporate citizen.&quot; The internal documents also discuss the avoidance of terms such as &quot;automation&quot; and &quot;AI&quot; in relation to robotics, suggesting instead that executives use terms like “advanced technology” instead. They even consider replacing using &quot;cobot&quot; instead of &quot;robot&quot; as the former implies a collaborative relationship with humans.</p>
<p>In a statement to the<em> NYT</em>, Amazon called the plans it cited incomplete and not reflective of its overall hiring strategy. It denied that its community efforts were related to its automation plans and said it’s not insisting that its executives refrain from using certain terms. The company added that it planned to hire 250,000 people for the imminent holiday season, but wouldn’t say how many of these would be permanent hires.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/new-report-leaks-amazons-proposed-mass-automation-plans-144822790.html?src=rss]]></description>
