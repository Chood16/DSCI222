But even for a niche manufacturer like Porsche, it&#39;s not exactly a mass-market machine. To really move the needle on EVs, you need something more family friendly, and for the brand from Stuttgart, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-all-electric-macan-suv-boasts-a-381-mile-range-and-up-to-621hp-163940921.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">that&#39;s the Macan</a>.</p>
<p>Porsche&#39;s gas-powered crossover SUV is its best-selling machine in the US, so it&#39;s an absolutely vital piece of the company&#39;s success. It&#39;s also Porsche&#39;s second full-on, battery-powered machine to hit the market. The Macan Electric doesn&#39;t replace its internal combustion predecessor, rather living alongside it on the dealership floor, creating a brutal sibling rivalry and a potentially difficult choice for buyers: gas or electric?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, Porsche made it a pretty easy decision. This is the right one.</p>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="8707b546-3f56-4560-81b4-a309ef2c4d22" data-original-url="https://models.porsche.com/en-US/model-start/macan"></core-commerce></p>
<h2 id="d3922d4d-b1dd-4319-8f38-1e5745baee3a">Hardware tour</h2>
<p>The Macan Electric shares a silhouette and a segment with that other Macan, but from a technology standpoint, there&#39;s little the two agree upon. The Macan Electric is built on a new platform called PPE, which at one point was destined to be the underpinnings of a smorgasbord of electrified offerings from both <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-10-porsche-and-audi-will-share-electric-car-platform.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Porsche and Audi</a>, including the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audi-unveils-its-latest-ev-concept-vehicle-ahead-of-auto-shanghai-2021-050009357.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">A6 E-Tron</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-audi-q6-e-tron-is-an-oled-dream-machine-140018286.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Q6 E-Tron</a>.</p>
<p>For now, at least, Americans&#39; increasingly fickle attitudes toward EVs have stymied some of those plans, meaning this Macan and the upcoming Cayenne Electric are the only two Porsches built from those bones. The Macan is the smaller of the two, powered by a variety of different configurations, starting with a single-motor, rear-drive configuration with 355 horsepower on the low end, up to the 630-hp, dual-motor Macan Turbo Electric on the high end. Buyers can also select the dual-motor Macan 4 Electric, speedier 4S Electric or quicker still GTS Electric.</p>
<p>I tested a base Macan Electric, its rear-mounted, 355-hp motor enough to scoot this 5,004-pound SUV from zero to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. The top-shelf Macan Turbo Electric gets to 60 in 3.1 seconds, absolutely humiliating the quickest exhaust-spewing Macan GTS&#39;s 4.3-second time.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a Porsche, not a drag machine, and so cornering is key. Helping with the handling is an adaptive air suspension that not only lets you go from stiff to firm at the twist of a knob but also raises or lowers dynamically. When you&#39;re hunting for range or speed, the SUV gets down into an aerodynamic tuck low to the earth. If you&#39;re looking to head off-road, it&#39;ll hike itself up by 1.6 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I wouldn&#39;t consider this an off-roader as such, the dual motor configurations should be competent in lower-grip situations. Open differentials at either end will keep your all-roading aspirations limited, but on some icy, slippery roads during the week I spent living with one, even the rear-drive Macan proved sure-footed and easy to handle, despite its summer-oriented Pilot Sport EV tires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of all that is a 100-kilowatt-hour battery, which offers the Macan Electric an EPA-rated range of up to 315 miles, depending on which trim you go with. In my testing, which included extended periods of driving with my foot flat to the floor, I managed 2.8 miles per kWh. That&#39;s a theoretical maximum range of 280 miles if you&#39;re driving like you stole it. Anyone doing the school run in a more sedate way will have no problem meeting or beating that EPA rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond performance, the Macan Electric has another advantage over its internal combustion counterpart: it has a more modern interior. The highlight is the 12.6-inch, curved gauge cluster. Using buttons on the steering wheel, you can cycle through various views and telemetry elements to suit your desire for data or need to remain undisturbed.</p>
<p>That&#39;s paired with a 10.9-inch touchscreen in the middle, and you can even opt for a third display embedded way over on the right side of the dashboard. This one allows you to access streaming services like YouTube. I&#39;ve never seen the point in that, though, but that&#39;s only because I&#39;ve yet to meet a passenger who wouldn&#39;t rather just use their smartphone.</p>
<p>Porsche&#39;s PCM interface on that central touchscreen is simple and clean, with more than a passing iOS resemblance. Perhaps that&#39;s why the company has been an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/aston-martin-and-porsche-showed-off-next-generation-apple-carplay-coming-to-their-cars-in-2024-220130805.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">early adopter of CarPlay Ultra</a>. For the Android faithful, wireless Android Auto is here too, and it works great, looking nearly native on the widescreen display.</p>

<p>Through simple menus, you can do everything from track lap times to enable or disable the augmented digital engine tone, which Porsche calls Electronic Sport Sound. I confess the futuristic whirring and whooshing does make driving aggressively a bit more fun, but most of the time I prefer to have it off.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not everything is controlled through the touchscreen. There&#39;s a separate, capacitive-touch panel just below it for climate-related functions, including toggling the prodigiously warm heated seats (which I&#39;m enjoying as I write this). You&#39;ll find a physical volume knob there, too.</p>
<p>The Macan seats five comfortably, though I&#39;d stick to four for anything longer than a quick run to a team lunch. Front and rear seats are comfortable, and there&#39;s a tolerable amount of legroom in the back. Headroom back there, though, is limited. If you have tall co-workers, they&#39;ll be tripping over each other to call shotgun.</p>

<p>In the grand spectrum of SUVs on the roads today, the 188.3-inch-long Macan Electric is on the smaller side. But, as an EV, it&#39;s heavy for a crossover. At just a tick over 5,000 pounds, it&#39;s a substantial 850 pounds heavier than a regular base Macan.</p>
<p>Porsche&#39;s engineers addressed that as best they could with the aforementioned fancy suspension, plus larger, 20-inch wheels on each corner. The result is an SUV that is, in Sport or Sport Plus modes, remarkably fun to drive. Its steering is extremely quick for an SUV, which makes this thing feel lighter than it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the grip provided by those tires and suspension really gives you the confidence to push through the corners, too. And, when you push too hard, it breaks away quickly and predictably. I enjoyed romping on the throttle hard mid-corner to kick the tail out, the Macan giving me just enough time to grin and give a bit of a steering correction before everything was right and the tires were stuck again.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a sports car, no doubt about that, and it tends to wallow a bit on bumpy roads thanks to all that weight, but it is far more engaging and fun than just about anything else in this category. Even this base model is quick off the line, but its breakneck initial throttle response is tempered by a somewhat flat acceleration at higher speeds. It just doesn&#39;t have the kind of Autobahn-dominating top-end that Porsches are typically known for.</p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;d have to cough up the extra $10,000 for the GTS, or a further $20,000 for the $109,000 Turbo if I really wanted that. Yes, these things get expensive quick. The base Macan Electric I drove started at $73,500, but carried enough options to drive its out-the-door price to $86,865.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are, at least, getting a machine that readily does double-duty. Despite its responsiveness and eager handling, the Macan Electric does a stellar job of settling down when you twist that Drive Mode knob on the steering wheel to the left, unwinding the suspension and relaxing the experience. The SUV manages excellent compliance over broken roads, flying over railroad tracks without complaint, and just generally being a calm and competent cruiser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&#39;s one, undeniable flaw that drove me absolutely nuts in the Macan Electric: a complete lack of lift-off regenerative braking. Porsche continues its adamant refusal to offer anything even approaching a one-pedal driving experience. That&#39;s a frustrating thing to me — maybe not quite as frustrating as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-phasing-out-apple-carplay-and-android-auto-in-evs-163104494.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">GM phasing out Android Auto and Apple CarPlay</a>, but pretty close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After driving a few different prototypes of the Macan Electric during its development phase, I very much enjoyed my time with a final, production version on some familiar roads around my home. It excelled in the dry and on slippery, early winter roads, made me smile when I was feeling rowdy, and then disappeared into the background when I just wanted to get home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn&#39;t a perfect machine. I&#39;d hoped for a little more roominess inside, I lament the lack of one-pedal driving, and honestly, I wish Porsche&#39;s exterior designers had gone a little crazier. At a quick glance, it looks a lot like a first-gen <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-updated-model-y-performance-launches-for-57490-123018911.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Tesla Model Y</a>, especially in Gentian Blue Metallic, which is a dead ringer for Tesla&#39;s Deep Blue Metallic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there&#39;s also the significant premium that you&#39;ll have to pay to get into one: $10,000 over a base, gas-powered Macan. For that, you&#39;re getting a lot of extra performance, a dose of extra tech and all the joys and simplicities that come with living the EV lifestyle. That makes it well worth it in my book.</p>

Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t <em>entirely </em>baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It&#39;s something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>
<p>Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html">VPN deal</a> this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to Proton VPN.</p>

Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.</p></li>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unity and Epic Games, the creators of today’s biggest video game engines, have announced a partnership that will make Unity games available in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/fortnite-is-finally-back-in-the-us-app-store-222946133.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Epic has allowed creators to publish their own experiences (or “islands”) within <em>Fortnite</em> since 2018, and the number of experiences has grown considerably over the recent years. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2024</a>, 198,000 islands were published within the game, double the number from the previous year. This partnership has the potential to grow <em>Fortnite</em> experiences even further by welcoming Unity developers and can give existing developers more freedom. </p><p>“Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” said Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, in a statement. “Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success.” Sweeney announced the partnership with Unity CEO Matt Bromberg at Unity’s annual developer conference. They said that developers will be able to publish games that use Unity’s game engine on <em>Fortnite</em> sometime next year. The companies promised to announce more details and exact timing in the future. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just announced at Unity’s Unite 2025 show in Barcelona: Unity has built an amazing new networking protocol enabling Unity games to come into Fortnite next year.

</div><p>In addition, Unity has announced that the cross-platform commerce management dashboard it launched in October will support Unreal Engine. The dashboard allows developers to manage pricing and promotions across websites and stores for mobile and PC from one place. It will start supporting Unreal Engine in early 2026. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/unity-games-are-coming-to-fortnite-133000076.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The SE 3 also now has an always-on display, making it easier to glance down throughout the day to check the time or see activity stats without moving your wrist, and fast-charging support makes it a more viable sleep tracker. Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, the Echo Spot is a diminutive little speaker/alarm clock hybrid unit. It&#39;s a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-revives-the-echo-spot-smart-alarm-clock-and-swiftly-discounts-it-by-44-percent-160304634.html">cute little doodad</a> and looks great on a nightstand. The screen is customizable, so it doesn&#39;t have to display a clock. It can show song titles, smart home control dashboards, the weather and a lot more. Of course, there are numerous clock faces to choose from.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

This is a smarter and more conversational version of the iconic smart assistant. Like most modern AI products, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">it&#39;s still working out some bugs</a>. The underlying tech, however, is promising.</p> 
<p>The speaker is decent enough for the size, though you won&#39;t be using it to fuel any house parties. It&#39;s a great tool for bedroom-based listening. This version doesn&#39;t have a camera, which is actually great news for the privacy conscious.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazons-echo-spot-smart-speaker-drops-to-50-for-black-friday-130550875.html?src=rss]]></description>

At first glance, Read AI resembles apps like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Otter.ai" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">Otter.ai</a>. You can use the software to transcribe and summarize meetings, but it&#39;s also more ambitious than that.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s AI on standby,&quot; Read AI CEO David Shim explains, adding that the company&#39;s vision is to give people a tool that can record, transcribe and analyze nearly every professional conversation they have, no matter where those discussions take place and whether they occur online or in-person. Today, Read AI is taking a major step toward realizing that vision with the release of its new Operator agent (I&#39;ll admit, the company could have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-operator-can-surf-the-web-for-you-210029243.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">picked a more original name</a>), and new apps for Windows, macOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><p>Between its own software, including an existing iOS app, and third-party integrations, Read AI users can now connect their accounts to more than 22 other platforms. Some of the more notable inclusions there are Gmail, Outlook, Slack, HubSpot and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/notion-mail-is-a-powerful-but-lightweight-email-client-for-busy-people-150007543.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Notion</a>. More importantly, with Read AI&#39;s mobile apps, you can record impromptu in-person meetings; the company has data showing that more than half of professional conversations occur outside of online spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSDdypg5_Nc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In any case, no matter where you talk to your colleagues, Operator is there to generate notes and insights. &quot;We don&#39;t just look at meetings,&quot; Shim says. &quot;We look at topics that are interesting to you.” To that end, Read AI has built a series of in-house multimodal models that look for context beyond what&#39;s said during any interaction you record. For example, the company&#39;s systems are designed to catch when you enthusiastically answer a question or look away in disinterest, and use that data to decide how the software goes about summarizing your meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;That context is what enables us to identify what is valuable to you, and make that discoverable,&quot; says Shim. One way Read AI will surface those insights is through a feature the company calls Monday Brief. At the start of every week, you&#39;ll get a summary of all the calls and conversations you had over the last seven days, with suggestions for follow-up actions you can take.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering, like I was, how Read AI hopes to compete in a market where a company like Microsoft is aggressively pushing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Copilot</a> on its users. If Shim is worried about the big players, he doesn&#39;t show it. &quot;There&#39;s a need for an independent third party,&quot; he says. &quot;There&#39;s always something new coming out. And that ability to be the independent third-party that plugs into different solutions is actually what consumers want and need.&quot; To his point, since the launch of Copilot two years ago, Read AI has seen a 20x increase in the daily number of people using its software alongside Microsoft Teams. &quot;We&#39;ve seen the same thing along those lines for Zoom and Google Meet.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He believes the company&#39;s approach to data privacy is another differentiator. By default, users are opted out of their data being used for training Read AI&#39;s future models. Shim also notes the company takes recording disclosure seriously. &quot;You need to notify people that you&#39;re [recording] a call, and we put that front and center every single time.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to try Read AI, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.read.ai/plans-pricing" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">offers a free plan</a> that includes five meeting transcripts per month. Pricing for its paid subscriptions start at $19.75 per month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/read-ai-is-building-a-note-taking-app-that-works-nearly-anywhere-130000235.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter.</p>

That&#39;s $100 less than its previous all-time low and the cheapest we&#39;ve seen it.</p>

<p>Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">one of the strongest in the category</a>. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we&#39;ve tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you&#39;ll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson&#39;s mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you&#39;re looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don&#39;t mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Meta announced last year that it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-entering-its-post-truth-era-on-monday-202858791.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">was ditching</a> third-party fact checkers in favor of an X-style Community Notes system, the company was careful to note that it would only implement the changes within the United States to start. Now, nearly a year later, the social media company is getting ready to expand the crowd-sourced fact checks to more countries, and is asking the Oversight Board for advice on a potential rollout.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has requested that board weigh in on &quot;factors we should consider when deciding which countries, if any, to omit from the international roll out&quot; of Community Notes. Notably, Meta isn&#39;t asking the Oversight Board to advise on the merits of replacing traditional fact-checking organizations. Instead, the company wants guidance on how to approach country-specific challenges and whether there should be any carveouts.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We respectfully ask the Board to focus its examination on the country-level factors relevant to omitting countries from the international roll-out, and not on topics such as general product design or the operation of the Community Notes algorithm,&quot; the company wrote in its request shared by the board.&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, Meta has been experimenting with Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram and Threads in the United States only. People who want to be able to author notes still need to be approved, but the company allows anyone<a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://v" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"> to rate</a> notes. However, it seems that the feature so far hasn&#39;t gained as much traction for Meta as it has on X. In September, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/guyro/status/1965800300557857053" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">company said</a> that just 6 percent of the more than 15,000 notes that had been contributed had actually been published.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement from the Oversight Board, the group said it would consider issues like whether a crowd-sourced fact checking system would make sense in countries with &quot;low levels of freedom of expression&quot; or without a free press, as well as places with &quot;low levels of digital literacy.&quot; It also said it was hoping to hear public comments from researchers who have studied different approaches to countering misinformation.</p><p>Unlike with a typical case from the Oversight Board, which deals with specific content moderation decisions, Meta has no obligation to implement any of the group&#39;s recommendations. But, the company has previously chosen to follow its suggestions in previous policy advisory opinions, including its decision <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-rolls-back-covid-19-misinformation-rules-in-many-countries-174746077.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">to roll back</a> COVID-19 misinformation rules following <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/oversight-board-asks-meta-to-reassess-what-covid-19-misinformation-it-removes-120032687.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a recommendation</a> from the board.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-asks-the-oversight-board-to-weigh-in-a-little-on-community-notes-ahead-of-expansion-110000208.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robot vacuums have become ubiquitous over the past few years, in the sense that there are more options to choose from now than ever before. In their early years, you&#39;d have to dish out $500 or more to get a decent robot vacuum, but that&#39;s not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth with mopping features, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine.<br><br>Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker to do one of your least favorite chores (and do it pretty well) by spending $300, or less in some instances. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do, like self-emptying capabilities or advanced dirt detection. Engadget has tested dozens of<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html"> robot vacuums at various price points</a> over the years and we&#39;ve narrowed down the best budget robot vacuums you can get right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h2> 
<p>Since I&#39;ve tested dozens of robot vacuums, I&#39;m often asked if these gadgets are &quot;worth it&quot; and I&#39;d say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like a self-empty station to further reduce maintenance.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty station, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair.</p> 
<p>When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-budget-robot-vacuum">What to look for in a budget robot vacuum</h2> 
<p>When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums.</p> 
<p>So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you&#39;re dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance.</p> 
<p>You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range.</p> 
<p>Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it.</p> 
<p>You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules.</p> 
<p>But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option.</p> 
<p>Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums">How we test robot vacuums</h2> 
<p>When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more.</p> 
<p>Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> 
<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it&#39;s ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides.</p> 
<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean.</p> 
<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B016UG1YVQ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbia_CCrFkNcgJ0zQ7ebgrU4mGP5Uw4OzoYjaSwMhcJw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fclean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning%2Fdp%2FB016UG1YVQ%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/clean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning/dp/B016UG1YVQ/">Amazon</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;itemId=walmart_transaction_121788585&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9pcC9OZXV0b3AtSEVQQS1GaWx0ZXItUmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS1pUm9ib3QtUm9vbWJhLTgwMC05MDAtU2VyaWVzLTg1MC04NjAtODcwLTg3Ny04ODAtODkwLTg5MS04MDEtODA1LTk2MC05ODAtOTgxLTk4NS1Sb2JvdC1WYWN1dW1zLTktUGFjay8xMjE3ODg1ODU_ZnJvbT0vc2VhcmNoIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWZlNzAwMy0wZjA2LTQ5ZGQtYmY3NS02NTBmYjgxYzIyMmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL2lwL05ldXRvcC1IRVBBLUZpbHRlci1SZXBsYWNlbWVudC1Db21wYXRpYmxlLWlSb2JvdC1Sb29tYmEtODAwLTkwMC1TZXJpZXMtODUwLTg2MC04NzAtODc3LTg4MC04OTAtODkxLTgwMS04MDUtOTYwLTk4MC05ODEtOTg1LVJvYm90LVZhY3V1bXMtOS1QYWNrLzEyMTc4ODU4NT9mcm9tPS9zZWFyY2gifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR0fvhpjAgri6zot6u_Z0ys9xKbrrvArCJmjNE70pBiJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNeutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack%2F121788585%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Neutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack/121788585?from=/search">Walmart</a>.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-budget-robot-vacuum-faqs">Budget robot vacuum FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-budget-robot-vacuums-good-for-pet-hair">Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair?</h3> 
<p>Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html">cordless vacuum</a> since those tend to be more powerful overall.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-budget-robot-vacuums-last-per-charge">How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge?</h3> 
<p>Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-budget-robot-vacuums-work-on-carpets-and-hardwood-floors">Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors?</h3> 
<p>Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-budget-robot-vacuums-have-mapping-features">Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features?</h3> 
<p>Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you&#39;re thinking of buying and look for &quot;smart mapping&quot; or &quot;smart home mapping&quot; in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.</p>

If you’re just looking to hit 60 fps to 120 fps of performance, or you just want to play the latest games without cranking up your graphics settings, these are the notebooks to consider. You’ll still find high refresh rate displays, as well as modern CPUs and GPUs. Just be prepared to live with slightly flimsier build quality, as well as plastic cases.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-a-budget-gaming-laptop">What is a budget gaming laptop?</h2> 
<p>To get a high-end gaming experience, you can easily spend $5,000 on a fully tricked-out notebook like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-blade-18-2025-review-an-18-inch-gaming-laptop-that-does-the-most-153000136.html">Razer Blade 18</a>. But when it comes to the best budget gaming laptops, we&#39;re focusing on the other end of the pricing spectrum: laptops under $1,000. Rising prices due to tariffs and a more chaotic economy has made it tougher to find these inexpensive gems, but they’re still around if you look hard enough.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Stepping up a bit to systems between $1,400 and $2,000 puts you firmly in mid-range territory, which is beyond the scope of this guide. Still, it&#39;s worth keeping an eye out for sales that can push those higher-end models below $1,000. Be sure to check out our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">best gaming laptops</a> for a general overview of what to look out for in these more expensive systems.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-are-cheap-gaming-laptops-worth-it">Are cheap gaming laptops worth it?</h2> 
<p>Cheap gaming laptops are definitely worth it if you’re trying to save money and are being realistic about what you can get at this price range. You can expect to find Intel and AMD&#39;s latest (but not greatest) CPUs, as well as entry-level GPUs like NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 4050. Budget models are also typically paired with FHD (1080p) screens running at a respectably high refresh rate of 120Hz or beyond — ensuring smooth frame rates in your favorite games. You’ll occasionally see some 16-inch budget options, like Alienware’s Aurora 16 when it dips below $1,000 on sale.</p> 
<p>Many cheap gaming laptops also skimp on specs like RAM and hard drive space. We&#39;d recommend getting at least 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage at a minimum. Modern games need a decent chunk of memory to run, and they also tend to be large, so you wouldn&#39;t be able to fit much alongside Windows 11 on a 256B SSD. You might be tempted to jump on one of those dirt-cheap gaming laptop deals from Walmart or Best Buy, but it&#39;s just not worth it if you&#39;re stuck with 8GB of RAM or a tiny SSD. You can’t upgrade those components down the line, which gives super-cheap laptops a short lifespan.</p> 
<p>As for build quality, expect to find more plastic than metal on budget gaming machines. Still, the best budget gaming laptops we&#39;re recommending should be sturdy enough to last a few years. Affordable systems will also be heavier and thicker than mid-range and higher-end models, and often don’t have the best Wi-Fi or connectivity options. Battery life is another trade-off, though even the most expensive gaming laptops can struggle with longevity.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-gaming-laptop-130004199.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cloudflare wrongly suspected that the widespread outage that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/cloudflare-hit-by-outage-causing-widespread-errors-124208302.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">took numerous websites offline</a> on November 18 was caused by a DDoS attack, the company’s CEO has admitted. In his <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">blog post</a> that breaks down what happened, however, Matthew Prince explained that after realizing their mistake, his team was able to fix the issue. “The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack or malicious activity of any kind,” he wrote. It was instead caused by a change to its database systems’ permissions, which led to an issue with a file used by its Bot Management system. </p><p>The company’s Bot Management system uses a machine learning model to score bots for every request they make when they crawl Cloudflare’s network. Its clients rely on those bot scores to decide whether to allow or to block specific bots from accessing their websites. One the uses of having bot scores is being able to block AI companies’ bots so they can’t use a website’s content to train their LLMs. In July, Cloudflare launched an experiment called “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/cloudflare-experiment-will-block-ai-bot-scrapers-unless-they-pay-a-fee-121523327.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">pay per crawl,</a>” which allows website owners to let an AI bot crawl their pages if they get paid for access. </p><p>Prince said the model relies on a “feature” configuration file to make a prediction on whether a bot request was automated or not. The feature file is refreshed every few minutes, and a change in the underlying mechanism generating that file caused a change in its size that triggered the error. “As a result, HTTP 5xx error codes were returned by the core proxy system that handles traffic processing for our customers, for any traffic that depended on the bots module,” Prince wrote. </p><p>This recent event has been Cloudflare’s worst outage in years. The company said it hasn’t had an outage that has “caused the majority of core traffic to stop flowing through [its] network” since 2019. Prince apologized for the issue on behalf of his team. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On November 18 Cloudflare experienced a service outage, triggered by an issue with a Bot Management feature, impacting multiple Cloudflare services.

You can now find an affirmation journal, where you can set your intentions for the day using the 120-plus cards the app provides. You can, say, choose the “grace” card that reminds you to be free of the expectation of others. The card is downloadable on your device, and you can share it with others. </p><p>You’ll also find an in-app soothing sound generator that you can use to listen to relaxing audio, such as those featuring the sound of rain, waves and white noise. The sounds stop after a few minutes when the timer ends, so you can play them to induce sleep when you go to bed. TikTok says its users are 14 percent more likely to listen to music to help them relax or go to sleep than non-users. You’ll also find different types of breathing exercises you can do in the new space. </p><p>In addition, TikTok is rolling out new well-being missions, expanding the original set it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-gamifies-mindfulness-with-well-being-missions-110014036.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">launched in July</a>. These missions, which are particularly designed for teens, will reward you with badges for completing challenges related to balanced digital habits. The new Sleep Hours Mission will award you with a badge if you stay off TikTok at night, while the daily screen time mission will earn you another if you set a screen time limit and manage to stick to it.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok is the latest social platform to hand users more control over the amount of AI-generated content they see. The app is experimenting with a new setting that will allow users to request to &quot;see less&quot; AI in their &quot;For You&quot; feed.</p><p>The new toggle will be available in “the coming weeks” in the app&#39;s &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-making-it-easier-to-control-what-is-and-isnt-in-your-for-you-feed-175301931.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">manage topics</a>&quot; section that lets people personalize the types of videos more likely to appear in their feed. In a blog post, TikTok says the control is meant to help users &quot;dial things down&quot; if they want to see less AI content in their recommendations. The update follows a similar move <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/pinterest-will-let-you-dial-down-ai-slop-in-your-feeds-130000337.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">from Pinterest</a>, which has faced complaints about AI slop drowning out authentic images on the platform.</p><p>TikTok, like most other platforms, has seen an influx of AI-generated content in recent years. The company, which requires users to label such creations, says that there are more than 1.3 billion videos with these labels. At the same time, the company notes that its existing methods for detecting AI content aren&#39;t perfect, Currently, TikTok relies on a widely-used watermarking system called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/partnering-with-our-industry-to-advance-ai-transparency-and-literacy?lang=en" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Content Credentials</a> that adds metadata to AI-generated content. But these signals can get harder to detect when images or videos are edited in other apps or copied and reshared to other sites, as often happens with viral content.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this, TikTok says that it will also experiment with an additional &quot;invisible watermarking&quot; system that could help it identify and label AI content more reliably. &quot;&#39;Invisible watermarks&#39; add another layer of safeguards with a robust technological &#39;watermark&#39; that only we can read, making it harder for others to remove,&quot; the company explained.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-will-let-users-tone-down-the-amount-of-ai-content-in-their-feed-050100596.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Built on a dedicated EV architecture, the Recon will deliver 650 horsepower and 620 ft-lb of torque. Its 100kWh battery pack will have an estimated 250 miles of range on a full charge and accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 3.6 seconds.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Recon is billed as the first and only fully electric Trail Rated SUV in the industry. This means it meets Jeep&#39;s internal standards for the traction, water fording, maneuverability, articulation and ground clearance necessary to earn the Trail Rated badge. Bolstered by its 4X4 capability and 33-inch tires, the Recon can tackle a wide range of terrains.</p>
<p>The Jeep Recon was originally supposed to be available in 2024, though the closest we got to seeing it in action was <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63148542/2025-jeep-recon-ev-spy-photos/"><ins>spy photos</ins></a> of a possible prototype at the tail end of that year.

This came after a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/jeep-recalls-194000-plug-in-hybrids-due-to-fire-risks-150059282.html"><ins>similar recall</ins></a> for Jeep hybrids the year before 194,000 vehicles, also due to fire risks.</p>
<p>The EV will have a starting MSRP of $65,000 and Jeep says production will take place at the Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-all-electric-jeep-recon-gets-official-specs-and-launch-price-000032015.html?src=rss]]></description>

The feature is one of several ways EV owners can save money with their electric car, by either using less energy overall, or receiving credits for providing their excess power to the grid.</p><p>Polestar&#39;s bi-directional charging feature uses direct current, according to the company, and enables &quot;V2H functionality for Polestar 3 customers on the 400 Volt electrical architecture.&quot; Polestar is offering the feature in partnership with home energy company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.dcbel.energy/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">dcbel</a>, who helps administer a California Energy Commission program for installing &quot;home energy stations&quot; that can manage multiple clean energy sources in residential homes, including EVs with bi-directional charging. Polestar claims that using dcbel&#39;s Ara system, customers can &quot;reduce charging costs by up to $1,300 per year and use their car as an energy backup during blackouts for up to 10 days.&quot;</p><p>The ability to send excess charge from an EV battery back into your home was originally a major selling point of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bidirectional-ev-charging-f-150-lightning-180545711.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Ford&#39;s F-150 Lighting</a>.

Polestar says it&#39;ll continue the development of the bi-directional charging capabilities of its cars and &quot;plans to introduce a wider offer in the future.&quot; While this partnership is the first time the EV maker is offering the charging feature in the US, Polestar already offers bi-directional charging to customers in Germany via a home charger it developed with Zaptec.</p><p>If you live in California and own a Polestar 3, you can apply for rebates on a home energy station at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://polestar.dcbel.energy/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">dcbel&#39;s website</a> so you can try the feature for yourself.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-evs-can-power-your-home-in-california-220215757.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, one notable contender among them has decided to withdraw from contention.&nbsp;</p><p>The fabulously titled <em>Megabonk</em> received a nod for the Best Debut Indie Game category. However, the project creator, who currently goes by vedinad, announced on X today that they were withdrawing. &quot;I&#39;ve made games in the past under different studio names, so <em>Megabonk</em> is not my debut game,&quot; the solo dev <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">said</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m withdrawing from The Game Awards.<br><br>It&#39;s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don&#39;t think it qualifies for the category &quot;Debut Indie Game&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game 🥸</p>— Megabonk (@MegabonkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The category is kind of a weird one, since indie creators may have worked at other big or small studios. Even fully self-taught devs will have made and maybe even released several projects before having any kind of breakthrough success or popularity. But if vedinad feels the game doesn&#39;t fit the category, then it&#39;s still a gracious move to bow out.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Megabonk</em> follows in the recent lineage of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, a popular bullet-hell roguelike that just arrived in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/vampire-survivors-vr-asks-what-if-the-bullet-hell-was-on-your-face-190749256.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">virtual reality</a>. The Megabonk riff takes the 2D concept into a low-poly 3D and adds some pretty wacky characters into the mix. Venidad said the title sold <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">1 million copies</a> in just two weeks, making it one of the latest Steam indie sensations to have a big moment.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/megabonk-has-withdrawn-from-the-game-awards-212822746.html?src=rss]]></description>

What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.<br><br>Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday tech deals</a> you can get right now, and we&#39;ll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-best-black-friday-2025-deals-on-tech-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-ahead-of-the-big-sale-100052689.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming.</p> 
<p>Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive.</p> 
<p>If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta has successfully avoided what was once the biggest existential threats to its company. A federal judge has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/meta-wins-ftc-antitrust-trial-over-instagram-whatsapp-deals" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">sided</a> with the social media company in a landmark antitrust case, ruling on Tuesday that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had not proven that Meta is a monopoly. </p><p>The FTC filed antitrust charges against Meta, then known as Facebook, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-antitrust-ftc-48-states-194858668.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in 2020</a> during President Donald Trump&#39;s first term. The government had argued that by acquiring its one-time rivals, Instagram and WhatsApp, the company had hurt US consumers by stifling competition in the social media industry. Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/ftcs-weak-case-against-meta-ignores-reality/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">had argued</a> that those services were only able to grow to the 1 billion-user apps because of its investment and had cited the rise of TikTok as proof that it continues to face strong competition.</p><p>On Tuesday, US District judge James Boasberg ruled in favor <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rww8JGP.20cc/v0" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">of Meta</a>. &quot;Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.&quot;</p><p>If the FTC had succeeded, it could have called for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. &quot;We are deeply disappointed in this decision,” the FTC’s  director of public affairs Joe Simonson said in a statement. “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.  We are reviewing all our options.&quot; The FTC could still appeal the ruling, though it’s not clear if it plans to do so.</p><p>&quot;The Court&#39;s decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.&quot;</p><p>A number of current and former high-profile executives, including Adam Mosseri, Sheryl Sandberg, Kevin Systrom and Mark Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-weve-learned-from-ftc-v-meta-antitrust-trial-162048138.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">testified</a> during the weeks-long trial earlier this year. In his testimony, Zuckerberg spoke about the immense pressure Meta felt from TikTok, saying that Meta&#39;s growth had &quot;slowed down dramatically&quot; as TikTok became more popular.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out that Meta&#39;s defense that TikTok and YouTube are major competitors to it helped sway Judge Boasberg. While the FTC&#39;s lawyers had tried to claim that Meta had a monopoly on &quot;personal social networking&quot; apps — a narrow group it said included Snapchat and the decentralized app MeWe — Boasberg was unable to ignore the dominance of TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>&quot;PSN [personal social networking] apps may have been a market unto themselves when the FTC filed this case in 2020 or when it approved Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014,&quot; he wrote. &quot;That is no longer the case. The Court ultimately finds that YouTube and TikTok belong in the product market, and they prevent Meta from holding a monopoly.&nbsp; Even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC’s case.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update, November 18, 20225, 12:08PM PT:</strong> Added a statement from the FTC.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-won-the-antitrust-case-that-could-have-forced-it-to-spin-off-instagram-and-whatsapp-184320742.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who needs a revamped Mac Pro when you can just turn several Mac Studios into a unified computing system? With the upcoming macOS Tahoe 26.2 release, Apple is introducing a new low-latency feature that lets you connect several Macs together using Thunderbolt 5. For developers and researchers, it&#39;s a potentially useful way to create powerful AI supercomputers that can run massive local models. That allows four Mac Studios, which can each run up to 512GB of unified memory, to run the 1 trillion parameter Kimi-K2-Thinking model far more efficiently than PCs with power-hungry GPUs.</p><p>While <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/11/25/m4-mac-minis-in-a-computing-cluster-is-an-incredibly-cool-project-but-not-hugely-effective" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">we’ve seen Thunderbolt Mac clusters before</a>, they were limited by slower Thunderbolt speeds, especially if they required a hub (which could reduce speeds to 10 Gb/s). Apple’s new feature allows for the full Thunderbolt 5 connectivity of up to 80Gb/s. The clustering capability also isn&#39;t just limited to the pricey Mac Studio, it will also work with the M4 Pro Mac mini and M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro. Developers won&#39;t need any special hardware to build clusters, just standard Thunderbolt 5 cables and compatible Macs. </p><p>In a demo, I watched as a cluster of four Mac Studios loaded and ran that massive Kimi-K2-Thinking  model in an early version of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.exolabs.net" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ExoLabs&#39;s</a> EXO 1.0. Notably, the cluster used less than 500 watts of power, which is around 10 times lower than a typical GPU cluster (NVIDIA’s RTX 5090 is rated for 575W, but its demands can also jump higher).</p><p>macOS Tahoe 26.2 will also give Apple’s open source MLX project full access to the neural accelerators on the M5 chip, which should dramatically speed up AI inferencing. Ironically, though, the only M5 Mac available today — the 14-inch MacBook Pro — only supports Thunderbolt 4. That means it won’t be able to take advantage of the new Mac clustering capability. </p><p>The unified memory and low power design of Apple Silicon already made Macs a useful choice for demanding AI work, but the ability to cluster multiple systems together over Thunderbolt 5 is potentially even more tempting to anyone working with large models. Of course, a Mac Studio with 512GB of RAM isn&#39;t cheap -- it starts at $9,499 with the M3 Ultra chip -- but that&#39;s only the highest-end option. Labs and companies that already have Mac Studios, Mac minis and MacBook Pros could potentially cluster systems they&#39;ve already purchased.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-turn-a-cluster-of-macs-into-an-ai-supercomputer-in-macos-tahoe-262-191500778.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s finally a way to gift games purchased on the Epic Games Store. Epic <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that it&#39;s now possible to gift digital games through the Epic Games Store, provided the person you&#39;re sending them to has an Epic Games account.</p><p>On a game&#39;s store page, you&#39;ll now see a Gift button under the normal Buy Now button. Clicking it will prompt you to log in to your Epic account if you haven&#39;t done so already, and then ask you to enter the Epic account of whoever you&#39;re sending the game to, pick one message from a selection of pre-written messages and then select the date you want the gift to &quot;arrive.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Epic-Games-Store-gifting-interface..jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Epic-Games-Store-gifting-interface..jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The Epic Games Store gifting interface for the game Arc Raiders." data-uuid="ac480559-80bf-4383-9240-96c6abfe8f9f"><figcaption>The menu that appears when you purchase a game as a gift.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Epic says that if the person you&#39;re sending the game to already owns it, you&#39;ll be automatically refunded. If the other person chooses to reject the gift, you&#39;ll also receive your money back. Not every purchase on the Epic Games Store can be gifted, though. Free games, subscriptions, &quot;pre-purchase offers&quot; and in-game currency are excluded.</p><p>Gifting is a basic feature of online stores, so on some level it&#39;s more surprising that the Epic Games Store didn&#39;t have the feature than it is that gifting is being added now. One reason why, could be that most of Epic&#39;s focus for its digital store has been on undercutting the fees of both Steam and the Apple App Store. </p><p>For example, in May, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/epic-games-takes-aim-at-apple-and-steam-with-zero-commission-policy-for-developers-183956940.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVsbG8uY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABZb3K_pQML3IUq1pifNhp8y6_LELNan56FGEWKOkDkQf-MF2fNgH4B9PKAw16x00ERl7Mb5kBByG3K2rlqQDcl0pPMpvQaRgFOJGFCuttnkpu-60ttAg1MDDsVOjxKhnlCDONWGa8f48CNWKYrBd43Cio2kEdhNRtjEB2AmkbWz" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the company announced</a> that it wouldn&#39;t take a cut of the first $1,000,000 in revenue that an app makes, after which it would only take 12 percent. That undercuts both Apple and Valve&#39;s financial arrangements with developers. Epic also regularly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-14-epic-games-store-free-games-2020.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">offered free games</a> through its game store to lure new users, something it plans to continue to do with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-14-epic-games-store-free-games-2020.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">its mobile app store</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/epic-games-store-will-finally-let-you-gift-games-191000946.html?src=rss]]></description>

Autonomous vehicles in Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando will begin accepting rides next year.</p><p>The Alphabet-owned company said operations (sans passengers) will begin on Tuesday in Miami. The other cities will follow &quot;over the coming weeks.&quot; This phase is where the vehicles drive around town without anyone inside. That gives the company a chance to spot local quirks and adjust the driving algorithm accordingly.</p><p>Waymo said this local adjustment phase requires fewer changes with each added city. &quot;This data feeds into a flywheel of continuous improvement, bolstered by rigorous validation through real-world driving and advanced simulation, then implemented through regular software releases,&quot; it wrote. The company claims its robotaxis are involved in 11 times fewer serious injury accidents than human drivers.</p><p>Waymo&#39;s autonomous vehicles currently accept passengers in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://waymo.com" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">list</a> of &quot;up next&quot; cities is much longer, including a recently announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-launching-in-three-new-cities-next-year-182515034.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">expansion into San Diego, Detroit and Las Vegas</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-coming-to-five-more-cities-190000992.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hypixel Studios has officially purchased the license to <em>Hytale </em>from Riot Games, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hypixel-acquires-hytale-back-from-riot-games"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Game Developer</ins></em></a>. This means that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><ins>development will continue</ins></a> just months after <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-and-ends-development-of-hytale-190435047.html"><ins>Riot shut everything down</ins></a> and cancelled the project.</p>
<p>The developer is also rehiring 30 staffers that were laid off as part of the cancellation. We write so often about <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eleven-percent-of-game-developers-were-laid-off-in-2024-according-to-gdc-survey-130003228.html"><ins>layoffs in the industry</ins></a>, so it&#39;s always a distinct treat to cover the opposite.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6ebbd9a18f6a4bd18096d7e800959a7d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We did it. Hytale is saved. We have acquired Hytale from Riot Games.</p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479578239049974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme calls this a &quot;new and exciting chapter&quot; for the game, which has been in development for nearly ten years. He says he is &quot;grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Riot Games, which is owned by the conglomerate Tencent, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-buys-hypixel-studios-hytale-171845047.html"><ins>purchased Hypixel Studios back in 2020</ins></a> for an undisclosed sum. However, <em>Hytale</em> was riding high at that point. The game had attracted over 2.5 million signees for an upcoming beta and was supposed to be officially released in 2021.</p>
<p>Years passed, and still no <em>Hytale</em>. This eventually led to Riot canning the project entirely. &quot;After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale</em> to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale"><ins>an official post</ins></a> on the Hypixel website once read.</p>

<p>The studio hasn&#39;t disclosed how it got funding for this move, but Collins-Laflamme said that the founders are &quot;personally committed to funding for the next 10 years.&quot; Here&#39;s to hoping the game is actually playable by that point. To that end, the company does plan on announcing an early access release date in the near future.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hytale</em> has had a long and challenging journey. It&#39;s taken longer than anyone hoped, and it&#39;s changed a lot along the way,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;This is not going to be easy. This is not going to be fast. This is not going to be perfect. But it&#39;s going to be ours. Built together: one feature at a time, one bug fix at a time, one mod at a time.&quot;</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Hytale</em> is a nifty-looking adventure game that can be described as an open world riff on <em>Minecraft</em>. It certainly looks like <em>Minecraft</em>, but it has a much bigger emphasis on action and RPG mechanics.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-buys-its-ip-from-riot-so-hytale-is-back-in-development-185040959.html?src=rss]]></description>

We’re already seeing lots of tech deals — many for under $50 and some hitting the best prices we’ve seen all year.

We rounded up smart speakers, portable speakers, streaming devices, smart plugs and Bluetooth trackers that are seeing notable discounts. It&#39;s all things Engadget<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/"> recommends in our guides</a> and elsewhere — and we linked to our coverage so you can read up before you buy.

To borrow imagery from the &quot;two Spider-Men&quot; meme, the AI world increasingly looks like a big circle of web-slingers, all pointing at each other.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat has introduced a new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-topic-chats">feature</a> called “Topic Chats,” which allows users of the social network to participate in public conversations about popular trends. By its own admission, Snapchat has previously focused on private conversations, but says the growth of its TikTok-like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-q4-2020-earnings-220645065.html">Spotlight</a> feature made it clear that people want to comment publicly about topics they’re interested in.</p>
<p>Topic Chats, which are coming to Canada, New Zealand and the US first, will appear in different areas of the Snapchat app in the shape of a big yellow button that says &quot;Join the Chat.&quot; Tap it and you’ll join that conversation, where you can also browse related Spotlight videos. The company used F1 and the reality show <em>Below Deck </em>as examples of topics that could feature.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snapchat will show you when your friends are in a particular chat, and any that you join will then appear at the top of your personalized Topic Chat page. Snap says it will moderate the new platform to ensure it remains safe, and told <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/snapchat-rolls-out-topic-chats-for-public-conversations/#:~:text=After%20primarily%20focusing%20on%20private,TV%20show%20%E2%80%9CBelow%20Deck.%E2%80%9D"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that it will use LLMs, among other measures, to ensure that topics being engaged with are of an appropriate nature. All profiles will remain private unless you’re already friends, which Snap says will prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages.</p>
<p>Topic Chats are set to go live in the coming weeks, and will appear in Chat shortcuts and the Stories page, as well as when searching or viewing Spotlight videos.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchats-new-topic-chats-feature-makes-it-easier-to-comment-publicly-on-things-youre-interested-in-171111409.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-wireless-chargers">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Wireless chargers</h2> 
<p>A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the slickest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our<a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html"> wireless charger guide</a> and our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">best multi-device chargers</a>. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-power-adapters">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Power adapters</h2> 
<p>While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html">guide to the best fast chargers</a> and we recommend the brand in a number of our <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html">accessories</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-macbook-accessories-150014737.html">guides</a>. Now that Black Friday is here, some of our favorite Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-soundcore-audio">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Soundcore audio</h2> 
<p>We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our<a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html"> guide to the best Bluetooth speakers</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4 is now discounted to $750 for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>. The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html">our review</a>, now for less.</p> 
<p>The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="3f7bcc453bef41d08a2f2f11cd9c2121" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks.</p> 
<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support.</p> 
<p>Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger.</p> 
<p>There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When a brand new company debuts its first product at CES, it can take a while before the device makes it to market. In fact, sometimes those products don’t make it at all. That’s not the case with Seergrills though, as the company has started shipping its AI-powered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-perfecta-grill-uses-ai-to-help-cook-a-steak-in-90-seconds-041030578.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Perfecta grills</a> to early adopters after introducing the machine at CES 2024.</p>
<p>The Perfecta relies on AI-powered cooking tech that helps you create “chef-quality results” in a fraction of the time as traditional grilling. It’s powered by a quad-core processor and an arsenal of sensors which allow it to detect food thickness, temperature and doneness. All you have to do is select the food and desired sear and doneness levels via the built-in touchscreen or the Seergrills app. </p>
<p>The Perfecta utilizes a vertical cooking system where food is held by so-called VertiGrates. Dual infrared burners move closer to foods as needed during the cooking process and can achieve a maximum temperature of 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit — hot enough to cook a steak in 90 seconds. Seergrills says the Perfecta can hit those temps in under two minutes, drastically reducing preheating times. This setup also means that there’s no flipping required. The company says the configuration will consistently provide the perfect sear, doneness and moisture retention. Over time, the Perfecta learns from your culinary exploits, refining various cooking profiles to become more precise with each grilling session.</p>

<p>And it’s not just a grill either. The Perfecta has oven, pizza and rotisserie modes — if you splurge for the requisite accessories — and a manual mode (called Human Mode) for AI-free operation. What’s more, you can build and save your own cooking profiles for future use. </p>
<p>Despite the oven look, the Perfecta is very much an outdoor grill. It runs on 120-volt electricity and propane gas in order to power the electronics and those high-heat burners. The grill is built with aerospace-grade aluminum, marine-grade stainless steel and both ceramic and tempered glass. The cooking grates are made of naturally non-stick stainless steel and internal components also use stainless steel for easy cleaning. Lastly, the drip tray and grease management system are dishwasher safe. </p>
<p>If you were waiting until the company starting shipping units before committing to one, you’re going to have to wait even longer. Seergrills is now taking orders for its fifth wave of shipments, but those aren’t scheduled to go out until May 2026. You’re also going to pay a lot more for it. Back in 2024, the price tag on the Perfecta was set at $3,500, but now that has gone up to $5,999. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool you can use to protect your identity online, change your virtual location, evade censorship, check out foreign streaming services and more. They mostly take the form of commercially available subscription apps, often so simple to operate that all you need to do is press a button to turn them on and off.</p>
<p>While using a VPN is easy in practice, there&#39;s a lot going on under the hood. Knowing what&#39;s really happening can help you decide which VPN is right for you, then use it more effectively once you&#39;ve got it. In this guide, I&#39;m going to delve into what a VPN really is, how it works and what you might need one for.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If this article convinces you that you need a VPN — and I hope it does! — I curate a collection of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-expressvpn-surfshark-and-more-120056432.html">the best VPN deals</a> that I update at least once a week. Head over there to get your VPN shopping started.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn"><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></h2>
<p>The name &quot;virtual private network&quot; comes from the initial use of the technology to access restricted networks from off-site — if you work remotely, you probably still use a VPN this way. Those are corporate VPNs, though, from providers like Cisco. Here, we&#39;re talking about commercial VPNs sold for individual use.</p>
<p>These services came about when people realized that if you connected to the public internet through a VPN, every server you contacted would see the VPN server instead of your personal computer. The VPN effectively becomes a mask that interacts with the web on your behalf. That&#39;s the simple principle underlying every commercial VPN you&#39;ve seen advertised.</p>

<p>VPNs like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">ExpressVPN</a> operate servers in various locations around the world. When you use their apps, you&#39;ve got access to all the servers in their network. After you connect, communications between your device and your chosen server are encrypted so nobody can trace your activities back to you. This is called tunneling, and is the main difference between a full VPN and a simple proxy server.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-does-a-vpn-work"><strong>How does a VPN work?</strong></h2>
<p>Questions like the above can get into the weeds fast, so I&#39;ll be oversimplifying here. VPNs handle encryption in two steps. First, they establish a secure tunnel to your computer or phone, then they send information through it.</p>
<p>The first step — establishing the connection — is called a handshake. It uses asymmetric encryption, where each party has a public and a private key. In a handshake, two parties use public keys to confirm that they are who they say they are, then exchange the keys they&#39;ll use for simpler symmetric encryption.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/84c5c620-4876-11f0-bf6f-eac7d01cf714" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/84c5c620-4876-11f0-bf6f-eac7d01cf714" style="height:1895px;width:3414px;" alt="NordVPN leak test" data-uuid="084ecc21-658e-3bba-8305-2be04f89936f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Once the handshake has confirmed the path between your device and the VPN server, the tunnel is complete. From then on until you disconnect, every packet of data you send will be encrypted before it leaves your device and not decrypted until it reaches the VPN. The same is true in the other direction. Website requests and other data sent between the VPN and your internet service provider (ISP) will not be encrypted, but that&#39;s OK — without the information on the first step, it&#39;s impossible to identify you behind the VPN.</p>
<p>This is a complicated process, but VPNs use sets of instructions called VPN protocols to run through it near-instantly. A VPN protocol covers encryption and transit using several sets of ciphers. The most common protocols these days are OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2/IPSec, though many VPN services have their own proprietary protocols as selling points.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-vpn"><strong>What are the benefits of using a VPN?</strong></h2>
<p>Although the above process happens mostly in the background, it does tax your internet connection a little. The best VPNs keep impacts to a minimum, but you may notice a drop in speed, plus higher latencies when connecting to servers far away. So, what benefits do you get in exchange for all that?</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-anonymity"><strong>Anonymity</strong></h3>
<p>The first and biggest boon is near-total anonymity. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) put out <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/look-what-isps-know-about-you-examining-privacy-practices-six-major-internet-service-providers">a comprehensive report</a> on everything your ISP knows about you — confirming that nearly every ISP gets a second profit stream from selling information on your online activities. In essence, they&#39;re making you pay them for the right to hose your own privacy. But a VPN lets you strike back.</p>
<p>Since you connect to the VPN server before your ISP ever clocks you (let alone your destination websites), your computer and modem broadcast no information about who you really are. Anyone can see what you&#39;re doing, but they&#39;ll only see the VPN server doing it. And hiding your IP address is vital — lots of people (not just ISPs) can deduce a shocking amount about you with no other information, including your real location.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-prevent-isp-speed-throttling"><strong>Prevent ISP speed throttling</strong></h3>
<p>Speed isn&#39;t normally one of the benefits of a VPN, but in some specific cases, you might get faster internet. ISPs occasionally throttle the speeds of certain users they perceive as using too much bandwidth. This can happen to you, whether or not the charge is accurate. Using a VPN can get around the slowdown, since the ISP can&#39;t identify you to throttle you. Just note you still can&#39;t go faster than your unprotected internet speed.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-public-wifi-safety"><strong>Public Wi-Fi safety</strong></h3>
<p>A VPN can also keep you safe when using public Wi-Fi. On an unsecured Wi-Fi network — the sort you often find in cafes, hotel lobbies and other public buildings — hackers can spy on you through various vulnerabilities, or even set up fake networks (called &quot;rogue hotspots&quot;) to capture your information. If your connection with the network is encrypted, the criminal&#39;s window of opportunity slams shut.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-get-around-content-blocks-and-firewalls"><strong>Get around content blocks and firewalls</strong></h3>
<p>The other most important thing a VPN can do is to change your virtual location. IP addresses are keyed to specific locations — some to countries or regions, and some to networks as small as one building. Authorities can use this to restrict internet access on the networks they control. This can vary in scale, from your school or workplace blocking certain content, all the way up to the nation-level firewalls in China, Saudi Arabia and other countries.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that your internet goes to the VPN before it goes anywhere<em>&nbsp;</em>else. If your school&#39;s internet blocks some sites, you could get on a VPN server and the school&#39;s firewall won&#39;t know you&#39;re connecting from inside. This even works with countries (though not always). By connecting to a server outside the sphere of oppression, you can organize activism online even when the government doesn&#39;t want you to.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/4d365ff0-67eb-11f0-adcd-a612ad3beeae" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/4d365ff0-67eb-11f0-adcd-a612ad3beeae" style="height:1623px;width:3281px;" alt="Surfshark Netflix test" data-uuid="b23557ad-c7d4-348a-816f-51e262e1cd9a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Of course, you can also use this trick for fun by checking out other countries&#39; streaming libraries, viewing local exclusive events or protecting you while you download a torrent file. The key takeaway is that VPNs are versatile, and can be used for casual entertainment, life-and-death anonymity or both at once.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-will-a-vpn-keep-me-completely-safe-online"><strong>Will a VPN keep me completely safe online?</strong></h2>
<p>VPNs are a huge positive for individual privacy rights, but just having one doesn&#39;t mean you can ignore your online safety. It&#39;s better to think of VPNs as <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html">one part of a comprehensive strategy</a>.</p>
<p>A VPN keeps you anonymous, prevents you from being tracked and changes your location to bypass censorship. However, it can&#39;t directly protect you from downloading malware, falling for a phishing scam, oversharing information on social media, using an easily guessed password or getting your phone stolen in real life.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one key difference between threats a VPN can prevent and those it can&#39;t: A VPN only protects you from being spied on <em>without your consent. </em>If all you&#39;re doing is browsing on a network, a VPN keeps you concealed. But today&#39;s malefactors have all sorts of tricks to get you to give your consent. Websites spam message windows until you click &quot;allow cookies.&quot; Hackers send phishing emails and make you click links that download malware. And so on.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-can-vpns-be-trusted"><strong>Can VPNs be trusted?</strong></h2>
<p>There&#39;s also one other critical point. Even if a VPN keeps you completely anonymous, the VPN itself can still tie your identity to what you do online. That&#39;s why VPNs all claim to have &quot;strict no-logging policies&quot; or something similar — they&#39;re promising not to abuse their access.</p>
<p>Naturally, some do anyway. A VPN can be sued if it breaks its own privacy policy, but many escape liability by leaving just enough leeway that they technically aren&#39;t in violation. The best way to determine if you can trust a VPN is to look at its history. How long has it been operating? Has it ever mishandled or profited off customer data in that time? On the other hand, has it ever been raided by police who then found nothing, bolstering its claim to not keep logs?</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e50f05b0-addd-11f0-adff-aaa6b91ebf5c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e50f05b0-addd-11f0-adff-aaa6b91ebf5c" style="height:1080px;width:1853px;" alt="PIA privacy policy" data-uuid="d310dfc3-fd76-32cc-af75-a92ea8ae6892"><figcaption>An excerpt from the privacy policy of Private Internet Access.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Some of the most trustworthy VPNs take technical steps to guarantee that they aren&#39;t logging user activity. Many use RAM-only or diskless servers that automatically delete any logs. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a> goes even farther, using full-disk encryption to render any logs unreadable (even if they did exist). These services back their claims up with independent audits from reliable firms.</p>
<p>Bottom line: A VPN is no substitute for common sense, threat awareness and a suite of strong security tools. It&#39;ll work best alongside a password manager, virus scanner and two-factor authentication.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-are-vpns-legal"><strong>Are VPNs legal?</strong></h2>
<p>VPNs are legal in every free country on Earth. While the UK recently suggested that a VPN ban was <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2127999/vpn-ban-on-table-online">&quot;on the table&quot;</a> to enforce its age verification laws, and the US states of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/wisconsin-wants-to-force-all-adult-sites-to-block-vpns-with-a-new-age-verification-bill-heres-everything-we-know">Wisconsin</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/04/proposed-vpn-ban-michigan-tech-watchdog/86463820007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=false&amp;gca-epti=undefined&amp;gca-ft=0&amp;gca-ds=sophi">Michigan</a> are considering bans in various forms, no democracy has yet outlawed VPN usage.</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.trustedinternet.io/blog/global-guide-to-vpn-usage">countries that do ban VPNs</a> are the ones you&#39;d probably expect — those with deep-rooted internet censorship regimes that VPN use might threaten. Belarus, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea and Turkmenistan have made all VPNs illegal. In China, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Uganda and Iran, only state-approved VPNs are permitted, and services that get approved tend to have government backdoors.</p>
<p>Other countries heavily restrict VPNs without banning them altogether, including Turkey and Pakistan. In India, VPNs are legal, but the law requires them to keep logs of user activities. The law&#39;s passage in 2022 led many VPNs to pull their servers from India and replace them with virtual locations.</p>
<p>Finally, there are countries like Egypt where using a VPN is legal, but you&#39;ll face extra penalties if you&#39;re caught using one to commit a crime. Also, it should go without saying, but VPNs don&#39;t make crime legal. If something is illegal without a VPN, it&#39;s illegal with a VPN, even if VPNs themselves are allowed in your state and country.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-are-vpns-free"><strong>Are VPNs free?</strong></h2>
<p>Some of them are, but many of them are dangerous. If you&#39;ve just been faced with a new threat to your online freedom — like, say, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html">the UK&#39;s new age restriction laws</a> — it can be tempting to jump to a free VPN to solve the problem quickly.</p>
<p>But free VPNs are easy to hack together, and app stores rarely probe them for violations before listing them. I frequently see free VPNs that either don&#39;t work, track you for ad sales or even <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/malware-apps-posing-as-free-vpns-are-on-the-rise-175629088.html">sneak malware onto your computer</a>. Another big problem is that many of these shovelware VPNs are all secretly run by <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html">the same monolithic entities</a>.</p>

<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html">best free VPNs</a> are free plans offered by paid services. With subscription fees supporting the free tier, you don&#39;t need to worry that the real money comes from selling your information to advertisers. Proton VPN, hide.me, Windscribe, TunnelBear and PrivadoVPN all fall into this category. None of them show you ads, but they&#39;re all restricted in other ways, whether by the amount you can use the VPN per month, the speeds you&#39;ll get or the servers you can access.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-do-i-need-a-vpn"><strong>Do I need a VPN?</strong></h2>
<p>If you use the internet — which you must, if you&#39;re reading this — you&#39;ll benefit from a VPN. To determine what you&#39;ll need it for, though, ask yourself the following questions. If you answer yes to any of them, think about subscribing to a VPN to address the problem in question.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do you feel strongly about whether your ISP and other third parties can see what you do online and use that information for profit?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you live in a place where the law prevents you from freely using the internet and/or forbids certain platforms?</p></li>
<li><p>Have online freedoms been temporarily suspended in your country because of unrest?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you planning to travel to a country with restrictive internet laws?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you normally use the internet on a network that restricts access to certain sites?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you use the internet for any tasks that would risk your own safety or someone else&#39;s if exposed?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you often get online through public Wi-Fi networks or networks without passwords?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you concerned that your ISP is throttling your internet speeds?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want to watch TV shows and movies that aren&#39;t available in your country on the streaming services you&#39;re subscribed to?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want to watch events that are limited to specific regions, such as local sports?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you enjoy looking in various regions for better deals on products you want?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you an online gamer concerned about doxxing and/or DDoS attacks from sore losers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Different VPNs have features that make them better at various tasks from the lists above.

Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tools/compare/tcl-qm7k-vs-hisense-u75qg/88608/96104">some reviews</a> say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content <em>too</em> bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it&#39;s not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set.

That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room.

It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks short of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-20-is-googles-most-capable-ai-model-yet-and-available-to-preview-today-170329180.html"><ins>Gemini 2&#39;s first birthday</ins></a>, Google has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3"><ins>announced Gemini 3 Pro</ins></a>. Naturally, the company claims the new system is its most intelligent AI model yet, offering state-of-the-art reasoning, class-leading vibe coding performance and more. The good news is you can put those claims to the test today, with Google making Gemini 3 Pro available across many of its products and services.</p>
<p>Google is highlighting a couple of benchmarks to tout Gemini 3 Pro&#39;s performance. In <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://agi.safe.ai/"><ins>Humanity&#39;s Last Exam</ins></a>, widely considered one of the toughest tests AI labs can put their systems through, the model delivered a new top accuracy score of 37.5 percent, beating the previous leader, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-must-spent-almost-an-hour-talking-about-grok-without-mentioning-its-nazi-problem-061101656.html">Grok 4</a>, by an impressive 12.1 percentage points. Notably, it achieved its score without turning to tools like web search. On <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard"><ins>LMArena</ins></a>, meanwhile, Gemini 3 Pro is now on top of the site&#39;s leaderboards with a score of 1,501 points.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Okay, but what about the practical benefits of Gemini 3 Pro? In the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-gemini-app"><ins>Gemini app</ins></a>, the new model will translate to answers that are more concise and better formatted. It also enables a new feature Google calls Gemini Agent. The tool builds on <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/jarvis-googles-web-browsing-ai-is-now-officially-known-as-project-mariner-191603929.html"><ins>Project Mariner</ins></a>, the web-surfing Chrome AI the company debuted at the end of last year. It allows users to ask Gemini to complete tasks for them. For example, say you want help managing your email inbox. In the past, Gemini would have offered some general tips. Now, it can do that work for you.</p>
<p>To try Gemini 3 Pro inside of the Gemini app, select &quot;Thinking&quot; from the model picker. The new model is available to everyone, though AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers can use it more often before hitting their rate limit. To make the most of Gemini Agent, you&#39;ll need to grant the tool access to your Google apps.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="http://blog.google/products/search/gemini-3-search-ai-mode">In Search</a>, meanwhile, Gemini 3 Pro will debut inside of <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html"><ins>AI Mode</ins></a>, with availability of the new model first rolling out to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. Google will also bring the model to AI Overviews, where it will be used to answer the most difficult questions people ask of its search engine. In the coming weeks, Google plans to roll out a new routing algorithm for both AI Mode and AI Overviews that will know when to put questions through Gemini 3 Pro. In the meantime, subscribers can try the new model inside of AI Mode by selecting &quot;Thinking&quot; from the dropdown menu.</p>

" data-uuid="f1fb023f-88cb-336b-b394-69bfd2fc1bd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>In practice, Google says Gemini 3 Pro will result in AI Mode finding more credible and relevant content related to your questions. This is thanks to how the new model augments the fan-out technique that powers AI Mode. The tool will perform even more searches than before and with its new intelligence, Google suggests it may even uncover content previous models may have missed. At the same time, Gemini 3&#39;s better multi-modal understanding will translate to AI Mode generating more dynamic and interactive interfaces to answer your questions. For example, if you&#39;re researching mortgage loans, the tool can create a loan calculator directly inside of its response.</p>
<p>For developers and its enterprise customers, Google is bringing Gemini 3 to all the usual places one can find its models, including inside of the Gemini API, AI Studio and Vertex AI. The company is also releasing a new agentic coding app called Antigravity. It can autonomously program while creating tasks for itself and providing progress reports. Alongside Gemini 3 Pro, Google is introducing Gemini 3 Deep Think. The enhanced reasoning mode will be available to safety testers before it rolls out to AI Ultra subscribers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html?src=rss]]></description>

You can get it now for $35.</p> 
<p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of Engadget&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">favorite streaming devices</a>. The stick supports a solid mix of advanced technologies for its price: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+. As long as the rest of your entertainment setup can handle it, you&#39;ll get a high-quality picture and sound. It also supports <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon&#39;s Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">Samsung&#39;s The Frame</a>) while the device is in standby. It&#39;s also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-is-better-as-a-retro-gaming-device-than-a-streamer-160022685.html">works well as a retro game emulator</a>, too.</p> 
<p>The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device&#39;s low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff.</p>

This model doesn&#39;t support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it&#39;s certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.</p>

Nearly three decades after its initial release, most N64 games look pretty catastrophic by modern standards. Can the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Analogue 3D ($250)</a> treatment save them?</p>

<h2 id="29eb67a5-9346-4c46-8608-7c0caf936efa">Origin Story</h2>
<p>The early to mid-&#39;90s were a heady time for console gaming. Sega and Nintendo had printed so much money in the 16-bit era that both were throwing everything they could at the wall to capture the fluorescent pink, velcro wallets of the gamers of the day. Wild controllers, endless system add-ons and even <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_VR" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">virtual reality</a> were in the cards.</p>
<p>But it would be the humble CD-ROM that really pushed things forward. Sega did its own multimedia add-on in-house, with the Sega CD. Nintendo decided to team up with Sony for the development of its own disc drive. When that project fell apart, Sony famously decided to continue on, releasing the original PlayStation in 1995.</p>
<p>Almost overnight, the gaming world was all about three-dimensional gaming, a landscape that Sega&#39;s Saturn was ill-prepared for. Nintendo, though, went all-in for its next system, the Nintendo 64. It not only packed more polygons and colors than Sony&#39;s system, but Nintendo finally cracked the code of how to make a truly good three-dimensional platformer with <em>Mario 64</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mario 64</em> is not only a great game, it became the template for how player and camera controls worked, defining rules that still exist today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N64 was also the first mainstream console to feature an analog controller out of the box, the first console since the Atari 5200 in the early &#39;80s to have four controller ports and the first American console to offer haptic feedback in the form of 1997&#39;s Rumble Pak. Today it all sounds quaint, but it was a truly revolutionary machine back in the day.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D is somewhat revolutionary as well, but for different reasons. At its core, it relies on a field programmable gate array, or FPGA, much like Analogue&#39;s previous devices (the Super Nt, Mega Sg, Pocket and Duo). An FPGA is effectively a processor full of virtual building blocks, called logic elements, which enable it to replicate any other system. It takes a massive amount of configuration, but the result is pure hardware emulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, it’s the same concept as Analogue&#39;s previous devices, just on a massively larger scale. Where the Pocket used an Altera Cyclone V FPGA with 49,000 logic elements, this one uses an Intel Cyclone 10 GX FPGA clocking in at 220,000 logic elements. While Analogue never gave much in the way of explanation, it&#39;s likely that the extreme complexity that resulted in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">delay</a> after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-will-at-long-last-ship-on-november-18-151854397.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">annoying delay</a> — well, that and the complexities of running an international business in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-threatens-a-25-percent-tariff-on-all-smartphones-not-made-in-the-us-195122531.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">tariff-laden minefield</a> that is today&#39;s global trading landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Analogue 3D very much follows the same aesthetic seen in the company&#39;s previous units: a minimalist take on the original hardware. It looks like a smaller and thinner N64 — one that requires active cooling, by the way, so make sure you don&#39;t crowd this thing in among your other, lesser game consoles.</p>
<p>It (virtually) supports all the N64&#39;s key accessories, like the Transfer Pak, the Expansion Pak and the Rumble Pak. It&#39;s USB-C powered and output comes via HDMI, and you&#39;ll find the requisite cables included in the box. There&#39;s also an SD card around the back for firmware updates and a pair of USB-A ports for good measure. Up front, you&#39;ll find four controller ports, with the distinctive circular style used by the N64. But you can connect controllers via USB or wirelessly too, if you prefer.</p>

<p>The system&#39;s default controller is again <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-40-analogue-3d-controller-arrives-on-march-19-200752420.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">provided by 8BitDo</a>, which has created special designs for Analogue&#39;s other recent releases. For better or worse, the $39.99 8BitDo 64 controller doesn&#39;t imitate the three-pronged N64 style, but does offer all that system&#39;s buttons in a more traditional layout. It&#39;s perhaps too traditional, difficult to tell apart from Nintendo&#39;s own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-13-nintendo-switch-pro-controller.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Switch Pro controller</a> from a distance.</p>
<p>I haven’t been a fan of 8BitDo controllers in the past. Given the premium Analogue charges for its systems, the 8BitDo controllers haven&#39;t risen to that level of polish. This new generation, though, is definitely a step up. The controller&#39;s buttons don&#39;t rattle when you shake it, the inputs have a good feel to them, the vibration isn&#39;t harsh and pairing is quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I did run into latency issues if I was more than about 10 feet away from the system, or if I closed the door on the cabinet that held the Analogue 3D. That&#39;s a far cry from the connectivity of a Switch Pro controller, which I can readily use from another room if I&#39;m ever so inclined.</p>

<p>Analogue has made a name for itself by obsessing over striking the perfect blend of honoring original systems while making them great in a modern world. If I may insert one automotive reference, they are doing to game systems what Singer Vehicle Design does to Porsches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But where cars both old and reimagined look great on the same road, vintage consoles struggle with modern TVs. Plug an original N64 into your 4K HDTV via a tangle of adapters, and you&#39;ll get a blurry, blocky mess that will make you question everything your childhood self held dear. Even if you go the hardcore route with something like an Open Source Scan Converter or an HDMI mod kit to take vintage analog signals and turn them into modern digital ones, you&#39;re still probably not going to like the results. That&#39;s because it isn&#39;t all about getting crisp signals from console to display. These systems were designed for cathode rays, where one colored pixel bled into the next to create a seamless view to hide many of the N64&#39;s 320 x 240 flaws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D goes to great lengths to replicate that look through a series of filters meant to replicate everything from a consumer-grade CRT to the sort of professional-grade monitor that cost as much as a new car did back in the &#39;90s. Analogue has experimented with these filters in the past, but they&#39;re taken to a new level here, with options for specifying monitor type, quality and size. The results are quite impressive, still a bit grittier than a giant-sized CRT would be in real life, but looking miles better than the unfiltered view of the games. You can even tune and tweak those display settings on a per-game basis, if you&#39;re especially finicky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#39;ll have to take my word for that. The 4K CRT effects don&#39;t really show up through a capture card, and as of now the Analogue 3D has no integrated screen capture functionality. That, I was told, is coming later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started my testing with the game that, in the eyes of many, represents the high-water mark of the N64 experience: <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Rare&#39;s classic first-person shooter shares a lot of its concepts (and surely its code) with that other N64 icon, <em>Goldeneye</em>. But, in the three years between those games, developers learned plenty of tricks, resulting in a game that really pushed the hardware to its limits.</p>
<p>Or past its limits, really. <em>Perfect Dark</em> was equally famous for its uneven frame rates. Expecting a one-to-one recreation of the original hardware, I was surprised to find the game running buttery smooth on the Analogue 3D. How?</p>
<p>The system includes a series of tweaking and tuning options, including something of a baked-in overclocking function. By default, it&#39;s on Auto, which, at least in the case of <em>Perfect Dark</em>, dialed up the Analogue 3D&#39;s power to make up for the original system&#39;s polygon processing shortcomings. But the Analogue 3D is nothing if not tweakable, and with a few taps into the system&#39;s menu, I was able to turn that off.</p>
<p>Now locked into &quot;Force Original Hardware&quot; mode, <em>Perfect Dark</em> played just like it did back in the day, a shaky and jittery testament to the overachieving aspirations of Rare&#39;s developers. And, thanks to more settings adjustments, I could enable the 16:9 mode in <em>Perfect Dark</em> and stretch the video output on the Analogue 3D, getting a proper widescreen effect — even though the game doesn&#39;t output a full 16:9 grid of pixels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond Auto, you can set the game to run in Enhanced, Enhanced+ and Unleashed speeds. I switched over to another game notorious for its poor performance: <em>Superman: The New Superman Adventures</em>. I initially reviewed this game way back in 1999, and it has since become notorious as one of the worst of all time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s no better today, but thanks to the Analogue 3D, it is at least more fluid. The game&#39;s choppiness is gone, replaced by a too-rapid pace to the uninspired ring-chasing gameplay. Sadly, the faster frame rate doesn&#39;t make up for the omnipresent green fog that makes <em>Superman 64 </em>feel so claustrophobic. Neither does it fix the crunchy, murky textures that surround you in <em>Perfect Dark</em>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not all bad, though. 1997&#39;s <em>Super Robot Spirits</em>, a giant robot fighting game released only in Japan, features untextured 3D models that use Gouraud shading to look a little less blocky. The result looks genuinely crisp and clean on the Analogue <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://3D.So" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">3D.So</a> too do games like <em>Mario Kart 64</em> and <em>Yoshi&#39;s Story</em>, 3D games that rely heavily on 2D elements, which scale very nicely up to a modern, 65-inch 4K OLED, like the LG B7 I used for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were few games that really popped for me. Much of the time, I was stuck looking at blurry, blocky textures poking out of foggy landscapes that were far less breathtaking than I remembered them 25-plus years ago.</p>

<p>Analogue&#39;s earlier systems take some of the greatest 2D games ever made and elevate them to crisply defined, high-resolution pixel art. They are gorgeous and charming to behold, which just makes them all the more engaging to play. Sadly, few of the games on the N64 stand up so well. Making these games look truly good would require pushing back the omnipresent fog and upscaling the ugly textures that plague many N64 games. That, it&#39;s safe to say, would go well past the point of faithful recreation that Analogue strives for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to fault the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Analogue 3D</a> itself for this. The hardware does a remarkable job of recreating that original experience. My N64 library has never looked better, and I am definitely enjoying digging into games I haven&#39;t played in decades, plus a few newly acquired gems that I missed back in the day. But, more often than not, I&#39;m left shaking my head at just how bad these games looked, and no amount of 4K upscaling and CRT emulation can fix that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html?src=rss]]></description>

Intuit’s apps include Intuit Turbo Tax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and MailChimp, all of which will now be accessible when using OpenAI’s chatbot for personalized financial advice and management.</p>
<p>The partnership is driven by what Intuit calls the &quot;hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses&quot; that ask ChatGPT finance-related questions every week. Consumers will be able to use Intuit’s apps within ChatGPT to research credit cards and mortgages, with advice tailored to their spending. They can also permit the chatbot to access their financial data to estimate their tax refund amounts and schedule appointments with a &quot;live, AI-powered tax expert.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the business side, companies can use ChatGPT to get advice on how to increase their revenue based on their current performance. They can also create targeted campaigns to send out to prospective customers and use AI to generate invoice reminders.</p>

Its $100 million contract with OpenAI will also see it widen its use of the latter’s models and their agentic capabilities across its platform. Generative AI allows Intuit customers to complete their financial tasks and ask questions about complex subjects using natural language prompts.</p>
<p>OpenAI is seemingly committed to growing its reputation as a credible source of finance-related guidance and information.

This year likely more so than ever thanks to the launch of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">Switch 2</a> back in the spring. But fi you were hoping to save money on the console with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-dyson-and-more-100052430.html">Black Friday deals</a>, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-announces-holiday-offers-for-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2025/">announced</a>, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real &quot;deals&quot; to be had. This is typical of Nintendo, though — actual Nintendo Black Friday deals are few and far between.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xbox has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/18/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-2/"><ins>revealed</ins></a> the last batch of Game Pass additions for November along with a couple of titles that are coming to the service in December. Starting today, though, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-crew-subscription-battle-pass-v-bucks-outfits-accessories-150000281.html"><ins>Fortnite Crew</ins></a> subscription at no extra cost.</p>
<p>That includes access to the current <em>Fortnite </em>battle pass, along with the OG pass, Lego pass, music pass and<em> Rocket League</em>’s rocket pass premium. On top of that, Fortnite Crew puts 1,000 V-Bucks in subscribers’ wallets every month.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft announced Fortnite Crew as a perk for Game Pass Premium in early October, when it jacked up the price of the service <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html"><ins>to $30 per month</ins></a>. Still, it’s a decent value add for <em>Fortnite </em>players, given that a Crew membership costs $12 per month by itself. Seems like as good a reason as any to check out the current Simpsons-themed season of <em>Fortnite Battle Royale </em>if you have an Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>As for the games that are joining the service over the next couple of weeks, there are two day-one additions to Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass. Action RPG title <em>Moonlighted 2: The Endless Vault </em>joins the lineup as a PC-only game preview on November 19.</p>
<p>Then, on December 1, a game we’re pretty darn excited for joins the fray in the form of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nostalgic-beat-em-up-marvel-cosmic-invasion-is-out-on-december-1-172217400.html"><em><ins>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</ins></em></a>. This is a sidescrolling beat-‘em-up from Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu, the same tandem that brought us the terrific <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-185022231.html"><em><ins>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</ins></em></a>. You can choose from a roster of 15 fighters in <em>Cosmic Invasion</em>, including Iron Man, Phoenix/Jean Grey, Spider-Man and Wolverine. The demo is a blast, so here&#39;s hoping for more of that from the full game, which is also coming to Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PS4 and PS5 on December 1.</p>
<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is a spiritual successor to Life is Strange from the creator of that series, Don&#39;t Nod. It <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/life-is-strange-spiritual-successor-delayed-to-avoid-life-is-strange-sequel-124553471.html"><ins>debuted earlier this year</ins></a> and it&#39;s coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Premium, as well as PC Game Pass, for cloud, PC and Xbox Series X/S on December 2. Don&#39;t Nod is also behind last year&#39;s action RPG <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, which I enjoyed quite a bit. That&#39;s coming to the same Game Pass tiers on the same platforms on November 25.</p>
<p>The other Game Pass additions for the next two weeks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo </em>(cloud, console and PC) – November 19, arriving on Game Pass Premium</p></li>
<li><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet </em>(cloud, PC and Xbox Series X/S) – November 19, arriving on Game Pass Premium</p></li>
<li><p><em>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road </em>(<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">handheld</a> and PC) – November 20 on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Crew Motorfest </em>(cloud, console and PC) – November 20 on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</p></li>
<li><p><em>Kill It With Fire! 2 </em>(cloud, console, and PC) – November 25 on Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the titles leaving Game Pass this month, <em>Barbie Project Friendship, Lords of the Fallen, Octopath Traveler, Octopath Traveler II and SteamWorld Build </em>(all for cloud, console and PC) will depart the service for the time being on November 30.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-now-includes-a-fortnite-crew-subscription-151826277.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon MGM has released another <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYsnngkS_U">full-length trailer</a> for <em>Project Hail Mary</em> and we are already at the theater seated. The three minute and four second trailer shows Ryan Gosling as Dr. Ryland Grace, a school teacher and former biologist who wakes up on a spacecraft with no idea who he is or why he&#39;s there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkcENinRJ-g">first trailer</a> gave us a look at <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-project-hail-mary-trailer-looks-like-the-martian-all-over-again-in-a-great-way-142119896.html">Dr. Grace&#39;s first moments</a> after waking up and an overview of his mission: find the one star in the universe that&#39;s not dying and save the world — no big deal. Today&#39;s trailer gives us a better idea of how he&#39;ll go about this and the alien he teams up with along the way. Check it out for yourself on Amazon MGM&#39;s YouTube channel <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYsnngkS_U">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ryan-gosling-and-millerlords-project-hail-mary-could-be-the-sci-fi-event-of-2026-174440164.html"><em>Project Hail Mary</em></a> is adapted from Andy Weir&#39;s novel of the same name. Weir also wrote <em>The Martian</em>, which was successfully turned into a 2015 film starring Matt Damon. This time around, Oscar-winning filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are directing with a screenplay by Drew Goddard — the latter also wrote the adaptation of <em>The Martian</em> so we&#39;re in good hands. The movie also stars Sandra Hüller as the head of the titular <em>Project Hail Mary.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see <em>Project Hail Mary</em> for yourself on March 20, 2026 in theaters and IMAX.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/project-hail-mary-keeps-us-intrigued-in-a-second-trailer-151108278.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mastodon&#39;s founder Eugen Rochko has officially <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/the-future-is-ours-to-build-together/">stepped down as CEO</a>. The move comes ten months after the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodon-will-soon-be-owned-by-a-nonprofit-entity-170009789.html">company announced</a> it would transition into a nonprofit entity and that Rochko would leave his post. Rochko will take on an advisory role with the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/my-next-chapter-with-mastodon/">blog post</a> about this decision, Rochko pointed to a desire for guardrails to avoid becoming another egotistical founder &quot;sabotaging thriving communities.&quot; He added, &quot;But it would be uncouth for me to pretend that there isn’t some self-interest involved. Being in charge of a social media project is, turns out, quite the stressful endeavour, and I don’t have the right personality for it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his place, Felix Hlatky has taken on the role of executive director. Hlatky has worked at Mastodon since March 2020 and plans to focus on expanding the team, long-term financial stability and making it easier to run servers safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Currently, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodon-is-adding-bluesky-like-starter-packs-182014446.html">Mastodon</a> is operating as a nonprofit in the US, but aims to set up a permanent home base as a nonprofit in Belgium, known as an AISBL. Mastodon previously held nonprofit status in Germany but lost that it last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastodon has pursued outside funding since its announced transition to a nonprofit. It shared that Stock Exchange co-founder Jeff Atwood and his family gave the organization €2.2 million ($2.5 million). Part of that influx of cash has gone toward hiring new employees in its engineering, marketing, operations and product teams. Rochko also received a one-time €1 million ($1.2 million) compensation after ten years of &quot;taking less than a fair market salary.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodons-founder-is-no-longer-its-ceo-143011438.html?src=rss]]></description>

That was me not too long ago when I started searching for something that could get rid of the pilling on some of my most loved pieces of clothing. Blessedly, I stumbled upon the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B00E3862DE&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c2468424-8ef5-4416-9d94-da26698b7118&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Philips+Fabric+Shaver&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAVcx60_ADYIA86h9WZgtpm2NyeAbUNCrS3qu83o3rv7L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes%2Fdp%2FB00E3862DE%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes/dp/B00E3862DE/?th=1">Philips Fabric Shaver</a>, a type of device I didn&#39;t even know existed, and decided to give it a shot. It&#39;s now an essential piece of tech in my house, and you don&#39;t have to pay as much as I did for it thanks to this Black Friday deal that knocks it down to $13.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="848802afed304ca5b041be2cdb9f74de" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes/dp/B00E3862DE/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Sure, it may not seem revolutionary — especially if you already knew of the wonders of such devices — but it was for me. I have a lot of T-shirts, joggers, sweaters and more that I&#39;ve had for at least three years and wear regularly. We also have a bunch of throw blankets around the house, partially because I love a good throw, and partially because my cat demands soft spots on which to sleep. All of those well-worn, well-loved fabrics have pilled over time, and I was tired of picking at the pills myself.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>This Philips Fabric Shaver makes it so I never have to do that anymore. It runs on two AA batteries, has a simple on-off switch and a shaving head with three sized holes that, as you glide it over your sweater or blanket, catches the pills and shaves them right off. It&#39;s literally as simple as that; after I tried it the first time on a pair of joggers, I spent far too much time running around my house and through my closet de-pilling as many things as I could. All the little fabric bits collect in a removable chamber that you simply empty as often as you need into the trash.
