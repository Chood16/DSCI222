                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than 800 public figures including Steve Wozniak and Prince Harry, along with AI scientists, former military leaders and CEOs signed a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e6de299-3eb6-4ba9-8037-266c55c02170">statement</a> demanding a ban on AI work that could lead to superintelligence, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e6de299-3eb6-4ba9-8037-266c55c02170"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> reported. &quot;We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in,&quot; it reads.</p>
<p>The signers include a wide mix of people across sectors and political spectrums, including AI researcher and Nobel prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, former Trump aide Steve Bannon, one time Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and rapper Will.i.am. The statement comes from the Future of Life Institute, which said that AI developments are occurring faster than the public can comprehend.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We’ve, at some level, had this path chosen for us by the AI companies and founders and the economic system that’s driving them, but no one’s really asked almost anybody else, ‘Is this what we want?&#39;&quot; the institute&#39;s executive director, Anthony Aguirre, told <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/ai-superintelligence-ban-from-prince-harry-to-steve-bannon-unlikely-c-rcna238747"><em>NBC News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to the ability of machines to reason and perform tasks as well as a human can, while superintelligence would enable AI to do things better than even human experts. That potential ability has been cited by critics (and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls045904068/">culture in general</a>) as a grave risk to humanity. So far, though, AI has proven itself to be useful only for a narrow range of tasks and consistently fails to handle complex tasks like self-driving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recent breakthroughs, companies like OpenAI are pouring billions into new AI models and the data centers needed to run them. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said that superintelligence was &quot;in sight,&quot; while X CEO Elon Musk said superintelligence &quot;is happening in real time&quot; (Musk has also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-27-elon-musk-is-scared-of-killer-robots.html">famously warned</a> about the potential dangers of AI). OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he expects superintelligence to happen by 2030 at the latest. None of those leaders, nor anyone notable from their companies, signed the statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s far from the only call for a slowdown in AI developement. Last month, more than 200 researchers and public officials, including 10 Nobel Prize winners and multiple artificial intelligence experts, released an urgent call for a &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://red-lines.ai/">red line</a>&quot; against the risks of AI. However, that letter referred not to superintelligence, but dangers already starting to materialize like mass unemployment, climate change and human rights abuses. Other critics are sounding alarms around a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html">potential AI bubble</a> that could eventually pop and take the economy down with it.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/steve-wozniak-prince-harry-and-800-others-want-a-ban-on-ai-superintelligence-123040020.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">budgeting app</a>. There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50.</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/one-of-our-favorite-budgeting-apps-has-50-percent-off-annual-subscriptions-right-now-174011845.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tablets are the perfect middle ground between your phone and laptop, giving you the best of both worlds. Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.<br><br>For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</h2> 
<p>Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-tablets">How we test tablets</h2> 
<p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p> 
<p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p> 
<p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p> 
<p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested">Other tablets we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-apple-ipad-mini">Apple iPad mini</h3> 
<p>Apple updated the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html">iPad mini</a> for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-google-pixel-tablet">Google Pixel Tablet</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html">Google Pixel Tablet</a> excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-oneplus-pad">OnePlus Pad</h3> 
<p>The solid <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html">OnePlus Pad</a> is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-tablet-faqs">Tablet FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-brand-for-tablets">What is the best brand for tablets?</h3> 
<p>The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one "best brand" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-a-tablet-replace-a-laptop">Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3> 
<p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-size-screen-do-i-need">What size screen do I need?</h3> 
<p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-tablet-accessories">Tablet accessories</h2> 
<p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html">2-in-1</a> instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came into this review thinking of Private Internet Access (PIA) as one of the better VPNs. It's in the Kape Technologies portfolio, along with the top-tier ExpressVPN and the generally reliable CyberGhost. It's one of the cheapest VPNs out there, its interfaces hold together and it boasts plenty of server locations.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Sadly, I was either misremembering PIA, or it used to be better until someone at Kape fell asleep at the switch. The more I tested this VPN, the more I came to terms with the fact that it's much harder to recommend these days, especially compared to the entries in our <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN guide</a>. The biggest culprit is unmoored download speeds that swing wildly from acceptable to unusable, but I also encountered dropped connections, high latencies and dead ends in the UI.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I want to make it very clear that this PIA review is a snapshot of a moment in time. I don't think this is an inherently bad service, but it needs to do a lot of work to right the ship. As I go through my usual 11-point testing plan, I'll make a (hopefully) cogent case for why you should give PIA a miss as of now.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access downloads and installs with very little friction across all the platforms that support its apps. Since I have basically no complaints about the experience of setting it up, I'll spend this section focusing on how it feels to use PIA on each platform.</p>

</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I have a number of issues with how PIA structures its apps on each OS, but I want to preface them by saying that this VPN generally works fine. It connects quickly, its settings are easy to toggle and it never puts active obstacles in the user's path. Each app except iOS has a soothingly dark aesthetic that's always readable. Keep that baseline in mind when I start describing what PIA could have done better.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There's no good way to describe PIA on Windows or Mac except as a mobile app dragged kicking and screaming onto desktop. This VPN app never misses an opportunity to remind you that it would rather be on your phone. By default, it's attached to your lower toolbar and cannot be moved or resized. You can change the settings to have it launch in a movable window instead, but you still can't change its size.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The main window is cluttered, but once you figure it out, there's a much higher degree of customization than most VPNs offer. Clicking the arrow at the bottom opens a long panel of additional widgets, including quick-connect links, usage stats, a snooze option and buttons for some of the settings you'll use most commonly. You can drag these elements around to reorder them, or click the ribbon icon to move each to the default launch display. It's quite cool — just not especially intuitive.</p>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The server list is another example of PIA's mobile fixation. Despite having an entire screen to work with, PIA on Windows does not let you view the main display and the server list at the same time — you have to click the arrow by the name of the current server to swap in the list of locations. This list can be organized by country name or by live latency test, though the buttons to change this are not clearly marked as such.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Though the search bar works quickly, the streaming-optimized servers are not sorted out from the rest. You have to type "streaming optimized" into search to see if your chosen country has a streaming server.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">You can click the three dots at top-right to go to the settings menu, which is a breath of fresh air after the clunky main UI. Settings are arranged in tabs, and each tab's design makes it easy to tell what its feature does and how to control it. PIA's launch window feels over-engineered to make a distinct first impression, but the settings menu is free from that hangup.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA's Mac app also feels like it was designed for mobile and then ported to desktop. Like the Windows app, it's attached to the toolbar until you change the settings to let it move independently. After that, it has the same problem of being crammed into a mobile-sized window, with the server list and the main UI not visible at the same time.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The Mac version also has the unique problem of not showing up in the system dock, instead working entirely from the toolbar. That said, right-clicking the toolbar does let you connect to the VPN and even choose a location, which is awesome and provides some justification for this design choice (though I'll point out that this could also be done from a dock icon).</p>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The main window of the Mac app can be reordered or expanded through clicking and dragging just like the Windows UI. The settings panel is accessed the same way and is just as seamless to use. In fact, one big point in PIA's favor is that its two desktop apps are almost identical — water in the desert after the wild swings of <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html">Norton VPN</a>.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-android">Android</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Having already complained twice about PIA's desktop interfaces feeling like mobile apps, I had high hopes for it on Android. While it functions just as smoothly here as everywhere else, it comes with a set of design decisions that are weird in a whole new way.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">First of all, you can't sort the server list alphabetically anymore; it's arranged by current latency instead, which means the list is constantly shifting in real time. Customizing the main window is now done by clicking a button at the top-right of the screen. This flips the entire look in a way that's likely to startle first-time users. It's ultimately the same interface as on desktop — drag widgets around and toggle whether or not they're seen — but it could be handled better.</p> 
<figure>

 <div class="photo-credit">

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The preferences list is not nearly as user-friendly as on the two desktop apps. Most of the important features are buried two menus deep under the tab marked "Settings," except for split tunneling, which is called "Per App Settings" for some reason (and barely explained).</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The larger issue, though, is that PIA on Android is extremely dependent on making you change system settings outside the app — which would be fine, except that it hasn't figured out a working interface for actually doing that. Almost every time I was prompted to change something in the settings, I got stuck on a prompt page with a useless button. Going into Settings and making the changes manually did nothing to unstick these pages.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Of all PIA's VPN apps, iOS is the closest to a home run, save for the inexplicable decision to lock the interface in light mode. I gather PIA was just trying to keep its iOS and Android apps visually distinct, but throwing out one of its best aesthetic choices isn't the way to do that.</p> 
<figure>

 <div class="photo-credit">

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">That gripe aside, everything else is nearly ideal, pointing to iPhone and iPad as PIA's natural home. The option to toggle what appears on the main page is finally done right — you still have to tap a button that causes a bit of whiplash, but it's much clearer what you're meant to do in order to shift, add and remove widgets.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA's browser extensions are available for Chrome and Firefox. They look fairly similar to the desktop app, but with some distinct features for the web. The best is the ability to instantly add the website you're currently on to the bypass list, which is incredibly handy if you're doing something non-sensitive and the VPN is actively slowing it down.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The extra features are organized into three categories: security, privacy and tracking. Security blocks WebRTC leaks and automatically connects unsecured websites through HTTPS. Privacy blocks websites from accessing your camera, microphone or real location and can prevent you from connecting to websites with known security concerns. Tracking, as you might guess, blocks various forms of activity trackers.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">It's both very thorough and surprisingly different from any of PIA's other apps — there's reason to use this extension even if you're already using a PIA app on the same device. However, its explanations of each feature rely a bit too much on technical jargon, so casual users might not find many of them helpful.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-other-platforms">Other platforms</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access can also be installed on Linux and has native apps for Apple TV and Android TV. To protect any other internet-capable device, including game consoles, you can install PIA on your router, which automatically protects any device connecting through your home WiFi.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I used Speedtest by Ookla to test how much Private Internet Access impacted my browsing speeds. Running a VPN inevitably reduces download speed (how fast web pages display), upload speed (for posting and torrenting) and latency (the gap in real-time communications, such as during games and live chats. The real question, then, is whether PIA can keep those reductions as minimal as possible — like <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html">my current speed champion, Surfshark</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This speed test was a marked disappointment. PIA had some of the most inconsistent readings I've seen on a VPN in some time — so bad I initially assumed there was something wrong with the speed tester. I ran more speed tests on more days than I usually do, just to make sure a fluke outlier didn't permanently taint PIA's score. Speeds were often good, but occasional sharp drops suppressed them.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This problem was especially pronounced with latency. In practically every test, the three pings swung wildly, sometimes ending up above 2000 milliseconds (or, as we call it in the business, two seconds). I can't say what the problem is, but until PIA fixes it, I don't suggest using this VPN for any split-second gaming.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Additionally, on my first day of testing, the server location PIA chose as the fastest gave me four-digit pings, download speeds below 2 Mbps and no upload speeds at all. Other servers worked, so the problem wasn't on my end. This didn't happen in every location by any means, nor on every test — but it repeated in Montreal, implying an issue with more than one PIA server.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Due to several low outliers, PIA's worldwide averages don't look good at all compared to other VPNs. The best news in the table above is that upload speed only dropped by about 11 percent, and download speed by about 34 percent, retaining two-thirds of my unprotected speed. But the inconsistency is a serious problem; PIA might be quite fast at times, but it’s unpredictable. I've reached out to PIA for comment on its speeds and will update this when I receive a reply.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-security-test">Private Internet Access security test</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Since most websites today use HTTPS encryption, it's very difficult for third parties to see precisely what you do online — but motivated people can still see your real location and the sites you visit. The purpose of a VPN is not to keep you completely anonymous or safe online, but to prevent your IP address and DNS requests from being visible to your internet service provider or anyone else.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I looked from three different angles to see whether Private Internet Access is actually capable of doing what its name promises. First, I checked to make sure it uses VPN protocols considered to be secure. I next used an IP address checker to see if any locations leaked my IP address, and finally ran a WireShark test to ensure all protocols applied encryption evenly.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA uses three VPN protocols to mediate between your device and its servers — OpenVPN (over TCP or UDP), WireGuard and IKEv2/IPSec. <strong>OpenVPN</strong> has provided reliable VPN security for many years now; it's open-source and constantly updated by volunteers to stay current. TCP is slower but more stable, while UDP is faster but more likely to drop connections. OpenVPN is available on all PIA apps.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><strong>WireGuard </strong>is a newer protocol that PIA <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=contributed+to+the+development+of&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvd2lyZWd1aWRlLWFsbC1hYm91dC10aGUtd2lyZWd1YXJkLXZwbi1wcm90b2NvbC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkMzlmY2ZmLWE3M2EtNDM2ZC1iZmRiLWRlNjE3ZTUzNGU3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpdmF0ZWludGVybmV0YWNjZXNzLmNvbS9ibG9nL3dpcmVndWlkZS1hbGwtYWJvdXQtdGhlLXdpcmVndWFyZC12cG4tcHJvdG9jb2wvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAexs9VEqW-drjn25LFpPgnLe1rDjmBA-Lxq-aaJTGWJs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fblog%2Fwireguide-all-about-the-wireguard-vpn-protocol%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/wireguide-all-about-the-wireguard-vpn-protocol/">contributed to the development of</a>. It's leaner and often faster than OpenVPN, and uses a stream cipher that's harder to crack (though in practice, both WireGuard and OpenVPN use cryptography unbeatable by existing technology). WireGuard is available on all PIA apps.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">WireGuard's one downside is that it stores user IP addresses to keep the tunnel open — but that's no issue if a VPN is following its no-logging policy, which I believe PIA is. See "Close-reading PIA's privacy policy" for more details.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><strong>IKEv2/IPSec </strong>is only present on PIA's iOS app. Its ability to stay connected through rapid network changes makes it great for mobile, so it's disappointing not to see it on Android as well. IKEv2 isn't open-source like OpenVPN and WireGuard, but when paired with the IPSec suite, it's just as secure.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">To run this test, I wrote down my IP address without VPN protection. Then I connected to several PIA servers and checked whether ipleak.net showed me a different IP address, ideally in a wholly different location. PIA passed the first round of tests easily, as you can see in the screenshot below — I never once saw my real location, which means neither DNS nor WebRTC was leaking it. PIA also blocks IPv6 on all apps to prevent it from leaking (this can't be disabled).</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">However, since <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html">reviewing Norton VPN</a>, I've gotten paranoid about VPNs letting security drop during server switches. So I added another test in which I changed servers several times while watching the IP leak test. PIA passed this test as well, always jumping seamlessly from one VPN location to the next without ever revealing my real IP address.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The last step in testing VPN security is to use a packet sniffer like WireShark to make sure the traffic you send is actually getting encrypted. It's pretty rare for even the jankiest of VPNs to fail this part, but any VPN that does<em>&nbsp;</em>fail gets an automatic blanket no. Luckily, PIA passed on all three protocols, as WireShark showed data packets with clear encryption.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-how-much-does-private-internet-access-cost">How much does Private Internet Access cost?</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Cost is one of the biggest reasons to pick Private Internet Access as your main VPN. At the monthly level, it costs $11.95 — not that much cheaper than its competitors and more expensive than some of the best, including <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a>.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The long-term plans change all of that. One year of PIA costs just under $40, or $3.33 per month. The three-year plan is an even heavier discount, costing just $79 and including three bonus months in the first period. That works out to $2.03 per month for the first three years and $2.19 per month after that.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A single PIA subscription can be used on an unlimited number of devices. This could potentially stretch your money further still, covering an entire family, friend group or small business. Having said that, as with Surfshark, you can still be restricted for using an excessive number of devices. PIA's <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=terms+of+service&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL3Rlcm1zLW9mLXNlcnZpY2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkMzlmY2ZmLWE3M2EtNDM2ZC1iZmRiLWRlNjE3ZTUzNGU3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpdmF0ZWludGVybmV0YWNjZXNzLmNvbS90ZXJtcy1vZi1zZXJ2aWNlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATx-uckKYcl4VAlQnZWuqbM01NJ4H5APZhxHjBSWQcbu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fterms-of-service" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> document states that it may contact users who appear to be abusing the privilege and can restrict access to the VPN if the abuse persists.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-side-apps-and-bundles">Private Internet Access side apps and bundles</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Alongside the basic Private Internet Access VPN service, there are a couple of add-ons worth noting. You can select one or both of these on the checkout page after choosing your plan.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA Antivirus runs continuous malware scans and sends you alerts whenever any activity matches its database of known viruses. You can schedule system-wide scans to catch malware that might have made it through the net. There's also a quarantine box for storing malicious files. The main thing you won't get is the kind of actively learning antivirus system that can catch new threats based on their behavior — for that, I still recommend a dedicated AV app. Adding antivirus costs $4.50 per month, $24 for a year or $36 for three years.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A dedicated IP address ensures you'll have the same IP address every time you connect to the VPN. A constantly fluctuating IP can trigger CAPTCHAs on some pages, so if you're sick of having to identify crosswalks just to use Google, this extra fee might be worth it. You can also add your dedicated IP to allowlists for remote access services. A dedicated IP address through PIA costs $5 a month, $51 for a year or $90 for three years.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-close-reading-private-internet-accesss-privacy-policy">Close-reading Private Internet Access's privacy policy</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A VPN's privacy policy is a legal document that lays out the terms of its relationship with its users. It's easy to assume it's all hollow words, but directly contradicting its own policy can get a provider in trouble. Looking closely at PIA's privacy policy can tell us what its priorities are, what your rights are as a user and how much you can trust it not to exploit its access to your secrets.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA is a Kape Technologies property, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">like ExpressVPN</a> and CyberGhost. I'll get into that more in the background check, but for this section, my overriding question was whether any loopholes in the privacy policy might allow PIA to share user data with its parent company, and from there to its other properties.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Fortunately for me (and everyone who cares about this stuff and isn't a lawyer), PIA has a very succinct and transparent privacy policy, mostly made up of bullet points. At the top, the policy states that PIA always handles customer data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), even outside of the EU. Further down, we get this key statement:</p> 
<figure> 
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e50f05b0-addd-11f0-adff-aaa6b91ebf5c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e50f05b0-addd-11f0-adff-aaa6b91ebf5c" style="height:1080px;width:1853px;" alt="PIA privacy policy" data-uuid="d310dfc3-fd76-32cc-af75-a92ea8ae6892"> 
 <figcaption></figcaption> 
 <div class="photo-credit">
   Sam Chapman for Engadget 
 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">That's pretty definitive, leaving very little wiggle room. It doesn't include device fingerprints, which can be used in place of IP addresses and activity logs, but lower down, the policy states that device identifiers can only be gathered from users who opt in — and thankfully, PIA's apps do not send that information by default.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The next section discusses what PIA can do with the information it does collect. It's permitted to share customer support data with Deskpro, which powers its live chat assistance. It also uses Stripe, PayPal, Amazon Pay and BitPay for payments, but sharing email addresses and payment methods with financial processors is standard even for the most private VPNs (Mullvad has this same carve-out, to name one).</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA ends the privacy policy by addressing the question of its parent company, Kape Technologies, stating: "neither PIA nor anyone at Kape Technologies logs or stores any kind of substantiative [sic] Personal Data, user browsing data, or individual connection data other than what has been outlined here, nor do we share any personal or usage information with third parties for marketing purposes."</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Misspelling aside, I'm perfectly satisfied with the policy. Combined with PIA's use of RAM-only servers without long-term information storage, this document all but eliminates the potential for abuse. A PIA representative confirmed for me that while some user data is handled by "cross-group employees," none of it is sensitive or identifiable.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Third-party audits are one more critical piece of evidence we can use to decide whether a VPN is trustworthy. PIA <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=passed+an+audit+of+its+systems&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvc2VjdXJpdHktYXVkaXQtMjAyNC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkMzlmY2ZmLWE3M2EtNDM2ZC1iZmRiLWRlNjE3ZTUzNGU3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpdmF0ZWludGVybmV0YWNjZXNzLmNvbS9ibG9nL3NlY3VyaXR5LWF1ZGl0LTIwMjQvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZdDfw-ed5MNWkj75tcJxDAE_DP3IE1Mbg8cSsbOc7Ek&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fblog%2Fsecurity-audit-2024%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/security-audit-2024/">passed an audit of its systems</a> by Deloitte Romania in April 2024, which found that it was adhering to its no-logs policy.</p> 
<p>The report itself is only available to subscribers, which is a bit annoying, but at least not unique. After downloading it through my account portal, I was able to confirm that Deloitte's investigation found nothing in PIA's systems that went against its privacy statements.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Chances are good that you found this review because you need a VPN to mask your virtual location, whether that's to <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html">get around age verification</a> or to see what's streaming on your favorite platforms in other countries. This section's test is designed to see if Private Internet Access is able to change your virtual location convincingly enough for Netflix.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I tried connecting three times in each in five different locations and recorded my results in the table. I used the streaming-optimized servers whenever possible, and the WireGuard protocol for the best speeds. "Unblocked Netflix" shows whether I got to Netflix without being caught using a VPN, and "Changed content" shows whether I actually saw a new library.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">My findings continued the trend of PIA being just good enough that I'm frustrated by the ways it fails to be better. PIA never got caught, which indicates that it's taking care to not use IP addresses Netflix has blocked. Three of the five locations — in Japan, Australia and Italy — managed to change the contest I saw.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">However, with all nine tests in each of those three virtual locations, PIA's speeds dragged so much that I waited several minutes to see if it had actually worked. The other two server locations, Canada and the UK, didn't change Netflix at all, no matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The bigger problem, though, is that PIA's fluctuating speeds meant Netflix took ages to load and often froze until I refreshed it. Shows stuttered and lagged even when I could watch them. Until it fixes whatever is going on with its speeds, PIA won't be a good choice for streaming in any location.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-investigating-private-internet-accesss-server-network">Investigating Private Internet Access's server network</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access has 155 server locations in 91 countries. Confusingly, I counted that it also has 91 virtual server locations, though it's not the same 91. Its network is heavily weighted toward Europe, which accounts for 44 countries, but there's also decent representation in Asia. Traditionally underserved South America and Africa get nine and four locations respectively, though they're all virtual.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Virtual server locations aren't necessarily a bad thing, but when used to excess, they may indicate that a VPN is more concerned with making its server network look big than ensuring it works for every user. PIA's server network is more than half virtual worldwide. Recently, it's added locations in every US state — again, mostly virtual, which makes it come off as more of a stunt than a genuine improvement. Given the trouble I had using PIA for this review, I find that there's something to the claim that it's more interested in growing than in working.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA's website has a helpful page that shows <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/kb/articles/virtual-server-locations-we-offer">where virtual servers are physically located</a>, though it's out of date, having been updated last in July 2023. The list shows that PIA tries to put the real locations of virtual servers as close to their displayed locations as possible. There are a couple of weird choices, like the Buenos Aires server really being in Miami, but that's mostly kept to a minimum.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-extra-features-of-private-internet-access">Extra features of Private Internet Access</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Private Internet Access doesn't have the wealth of features you'll see on the likes of Surfshark or <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN</a>, but it's not quite as bare-bones as ExpressVPN, either. Some of its most interesting extras are self-explanatory, while others are a little technical. I'll explain the most important features here.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-kill-switch">Kill switch</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">A kill switch is a must-have for a safe VPN. While active, the kill switch makes it impossible to connect outside the VPN tunnel, which keeps you from accidentally connecting to malicious fake servers. This also means that if PIA drops your connection for any reason, you won't be able to get online at all — which can be annoying, but saves you from broadcasting any sensitive information without encryption.</p> 
<figure>

 <div class="photo-credit">

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA comes with two levels of kill switch. The basic version watches for traffic outside the tunnel when the VPN is active. The stronger "advanced kill switch" works even when you aren't connected to the VPN, so you cannot get online at all without being protected by PIA first.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-pia-mace">PIA MACE</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">MACE is PIA's ad blocker. It keeps a list of domains known to display ads, malware, scams or invasive trackers, and blocks them all from loading. This won't stop all ads, since some of them come from domains considered legitimate — notably, MACE can't do anything about YouTube video ads — but it works on most banner ads and definitely lightened the load on my browser.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">MACE is available on all PIA's apps except iOS. iPhone and iPad users instead get a content blocker that does much the same thing, but only on Safari. If you prefer to use Chrome or Firefox on your iOS device, you're out of luck (unless of course you get another ad blocker).</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-maximum-transfer-unit-mtu">Maximum transfer unit (MTU)</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">MTU is a somewhat technical feature. You may not need it, unless your connection is extremely sluggish and the traditional fixes don't work. In short, MTU limits how much data can move through PIA's servers at a time. Large packets complete loading faster, but may struggle on shaky connections. Small packets make for slower but more stable downloads overall.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I say you probably won't need it because it's almost always best to leave it on the auto setting and let PIA pick MTU on its own. I ran some speed tests with both the large and small MTU options and didn't see a noticeable difference. That indicates that PIA is pretty good at picking the best MTU, so in most cases, just let it cook.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-automation">Automation</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">On the automation tab in PIA's settings, you can set up rules to save you some trouble with the VPN. On Mac and iOS, automation can respond to three types of network: protected Wi-Fi, open Wi-Fi and wired. On each of these, you can set PIA to automatically connect or disconnect. That's it — you can only have a maximum of three rules.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Android and Windows users get the option to make rules for specific networks, but only the network they're currently connected to. On every platform, there's no way to determine which server PIA auto-connects to. It always picks the fastest.</p>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The inch-deep options on their own would make for a disappointing feature, but there's a bigger issue: it doesn't work half the time. I spent at least an hour on four different platforms trying to make automation happen. On iOS and macOS, I could make the rules, but they never triggered. With Android, I got stuck at a prompt telling me to enable location services, which I had already done.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Windows was the only version where PIA's automation worked the first time. On the plus side, it gave me the question I used to test PIA's customer support.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Split tunneling — which lets you decide which apps or websites go through the VPN tunnel and which stay outside — is a common feature, but PIA surprisingly has one of the best implementations of it. To start with, it can split tunnel by app or by IP address, which lets you protect specific websites or leave them unencrypted.</p> 
<figure> 
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/7d83fd80-adea-11f0-bf7d-863e04ca11ce" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/7d83fd80-adea-11f0-bf7d-863e04ca11ce" style="height:1335px;width:1954px;" alt="PIA split tunneling" data-uuid="a4f600d2-76dc-39a7-8dfc-2c1810d0a097"> 
 <figcaption></figcaption> 
 <div class="photo-credit">
   Sam Chapman for Engadget 
 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In another layer of versatility, you can make your split tunnel rules in normal or inverse fashion. Either every app and website uses the VPN except the ones you designate, or <em>only </em>the ones you designate use the VPN. All these options give you a much finer level of control that you get over the automation feature.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-multi-hop-via-shadowsocks-and-socks5">Multi-Hop via Shadowsocks and SOCKS5</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Double-hop or multi-hop is when a VPN runs your requests through two servers instead of one. PIA handles multi-hop a little differently than other VPNs, as the second server will always be a Shadowsocks or SOCKS5 proxy. These two protocols are designed to obfuscate VPN traffic so it looks like a regular connection, which gets you around certain firewalls.</p> 
<figure> 
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/90939930-adea-11f0-aaab-156f12db2a63" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/90939930-adea-11f0-aaab-156f12db2a63" style="height:1334px;width:1950px;" alt="PIA multi-hop" data-uuid="3a7e054f-dd43-3db9-9929-654d0c190165"> 
 <figcaption></figcaption> 
 <div class="photo-credit">
   Sam Chapman for Engadget 
 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">If you choose a SOCKS5 proxy, you'll need to get a server address from an outside service and set it up yourself. If you pick Shadowsocks, which is the more secure option anyway, you can choose from a list of locations to use as the first node. It's nice to have so many choices, but still a bit frustrating that you can't get obfuscation without also using double VPN (which only works on the OpenVPN protocol).</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The final PIA feature worth noting is port forwarding, which keeps the VPN from getting in the way of any outward-facing services you might be using. This gives you a more stable connection on remote desktop protocols or torrenting clients — especially the latter, as that's the sort of traffic you really want to keep encrypted.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-customer-support-options">Private Internet Access customer support options</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">When I set out to test the automation features of Private Internet Access, I found myself blocked on the Android app. A notification popped up telling me to enable background access to location services, but the button labeled "go to permissions settings" didn't do anything. I took the long way around and made the changes myself, but the pop-up remained stubborn.</p> 
<figure>

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This gave me a perfect opportunity to see how PIA helps users caught in predicaments like this one. First, I went to the website and clicked "support" in the top banner to reach the <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/">PIA helpdesk</a>. Then the trouble started. I opened up the Android guide on my Mac laptop and waited several minutes for the file to load. When it didn't, I tried my Android phone, which also didn't work. I checked back on the laptop, where I finally saw the guide after reloading the page.</p> 
<figure>

 <div class="photo-credit">

 </div> 
</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">After all that, the guide said nothing about my problem. Nor could I find it anywhere in the general FAQs, which kept splitting into smaller and smaller categories which never really explained what I'd find. However, after a few minutes of searching, I found the problem had resolved itself with no explanation.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-live-support-experience">Live support experience</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I still had to test live chat, though, so I pivoted to a new problem: how to get the Android automation feature to recognize my home Wi-Fi network instead of calling it "unknown SSID." I couldn't be sure it was my own network and not a malicious duplicate. This may sound like paranoid nitpicking, but paranoid nitpicking is the bread and butter of cybersecurity.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I first had to find live chat, which confusingly can't be accessed through the helpdesk — you have to go back to the main website. I managed to get past the AI gatekeeper fairly quickly, and sat to wait for a human agent.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In less than a minute, I was chatting with Carl, who requested screenshots and ran me through some tests. Carl was able to explain that the pop-up problem had resolved because I'd given PIA full access to location services (which is not something the window itself specified I would need to do), but the unknown SSID issue persisted.</p> 
<figure>

</figure> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Carl was diligent, but slow. After well over 30 minutes of back-and-forth, during which I sent over two screenshots and a debug log, he told me we'd have to escalate the problem. I got an email from the support team about a day later that suggested I try connecting to other Wi-Fi networks and see if the problem persisted; this eventually led me to discover the culprit in my router settings, so I can't blame PIA for this one.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-private-internet-access-background-check">Private Internet Access background check</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The final step, as always, is to look into the history of Private Internet Access as a corporation and look for any red flags I may have missed. A VPN's biography can reveal its attitudes about critical aspects of its job and show how it might behave in the future.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">PIA was launched in 2010 by Andrew Lee in Denver, Colorado, where it's still based today. In 2019, the brand was acquired by <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://torrentfreak.com/private-internet-access-to-be-acquired-by-kape/">Kape Technologies</a>, owners of ExpressVPN, CyberGhost and the now-defunct ZenMate. I won't relitigate the full Kape controversy here; you can find a longer summary in my <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">ExpressVPN review</a>. Suffice to say that while it's come under scrutiny in the past for tacitly allowing its products to become malware vectors, there's no evidence the acquisition changed anything substantial about how PIA operated.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Most of the usual red flags aren't factors here. PIA has never suffered a serious hack or breach. In its 15-year record, I only found two things worth pointing out: a controversial executive and its United States headquarters.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-former-cto-mark-karpeles">Former CTO Mark Karpeles</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Mark Karpeles was the CEO of Mt. Gox, the market for <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>trading cards that became the world's largest crypto exchange, only to <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mt-gox.asp">lose it all in a massive hack</a> that's never been fully explained. Karpeles was arrested in Japan after the heist and <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://archive.is/pmkR0">found guilty of falsifying records</a>, but was sentenced to time served and released in 2019.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">While the Japan trial was ongoing, <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-former-ceo-karpeles-lands-new-job/">Karpeles joined PIA parent company London Trust Media</a> as its chief technical officer. PIA founder Andrew Lee defended the hiring in <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ed39fcff-a73a-436d-bfdb-de617e534e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=a+statement+on+the+PIA+blog&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvd2h5LWktaGlyZWQtbXQtZ294LWV4LWNlby1tYXJrLWthcnBlbGVzLWFzLWN0by1vZi1sb25kb24tdHJ1c3QtbWVkaWEvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZDM5ZmNmZi1hNzNhLTQzNmQtYmZkYi1kZTYxN2U1MzRlN2YiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByaXZhdGVpbnRlcm5ldGFjY2Vzcy5jb20vYmxvZy93aHktaS1oaXJlZC1tdC1nb3gtZXgtY2VvLW1hcmsta2FycGVsZXMtYXMtY3RvLW9mLWxvbmRvbi10cnVzdC1tZWRpYS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY70OT-HwDyh2fV_XGpYDPuvVmkeoF7JW0Fy2brwt_1B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fblog%2Fwhy-i-hired-mt-gox-ex-ceo-mark-karpeles-as-cto-of-london-trust-media%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/why-i-hired-mt-gox-ex-ceo-mark-karpeles-as-cto-of-london-trust-media/">a statement on the PIA blog</a>, writing that "If we, as a society, do not give second chances to those who fall, then we as a society will cease to progress," and comparing Karpeles's arrest to Steve Jobs being forced out of Apple.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Neither man works at PIA anymore. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/karpeles?trk=people-guest_people_search-card">his LinkedIn</a>, Karpeles left London Trust Media after the Kape Acquisition in 2019. Lee left at the same time, and these days seems less interested in cybersecurity than in <a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-andrew-lee-became-the-crown-prince-of-koreaand-made-a-digital-kingdom/">trying to become the Prince of Korea</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Bottom line: Although hiring an executive in the middle of his malfeasance trial may be terrible optics, the whole controversy isn't relevant to the VPN's operations today.</p> 
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;" id="jump-link-us-headquarters-and-five-eyes">US headquarters and Five Eyes</h3> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The other potential sticking point with PIA is that it's headquartered in the United States, which is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing agreement. Now, I'm on the record as not thinking Five Eyes is a big deal for a VPN — either the VPN is following its privacy policy, in which case it'll have nothing to share with intelligence agents, or it's not, in which case its location is the least of its problems.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">As I concluded in the Privacy section, whatever PIA's flaws, it's not mishandling user data or violating its own privacy policy. That's not only confirmed by two audits, but also by <a data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://torrentfreak.com/private-internet-access-no-logging-claims-proven-true-again-in-court-180606/">two separate</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:38;pos:1" href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-no-logging-claims-tested-in-fbi-case-160312/">court cases</a> in which PIA was unable to comply with requests for logs on its customers. If the VPN doesn't save information, there's nothing for Five Eyes to access.</p> 
<h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;" id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There's plenty that does work about PIA. Its privacy and security are unimpeachable — it uses vetted protocols with strong encryption and doesn't leak. Its iOS app is a nearly perfect mobile VPN, and the ability to customize the home screen on every app is a great touch. Split tunneling is outstanding, MACE blocks ads efficiently and I even like the automation (though I wish it was deeper).</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">But PIA is aggravating to use in too many ways. While its servers are frequently fast, you can't trust that download speeds will hold from one moment to the next. Basic quality assurance, like assuring pop-up buttons always do something when pressed, seems to have gone by the wayside in its Android app.</p> 
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In spite of it all, I still recommend Private Internet Access as a budget VPN. Its three-year plan is the cheapest subscription on the market right now. At $2.00 per month, I'm prepared to forgive a lot, especially at a time when all our wallets are squeezed.</p>

With a 61-megapixel sensor, it shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter. Even after a few years, it's still one of the best high-resolution full-frame cameras on the market and is an exceptional steal at this price.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Though also released a few years ago, Sony's A7 IV also received an <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">excellent Engadget review score</a> and is still one of the best mainstream cameras available. Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawbacks are rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter, plus the relatively high price.</p>

<p>After dropping hints for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html">over two years</a>, Samsung, in partnership with Google, finally revealed its first-ever Android extended reality headset Tuesday night. The new device, dubbed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html">Galaxy XR</a>, will run you $1,800 and you can actually <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">buy it today</a>.</p>
<p>Due to its collaboration with Google, it&#39;s not a surprise that the headset comes fully equipped with Gemini AI built in. &quot;Android XR is the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era, and we are incredibly excited to take a significant leap forward today with the launch of Galaxy XR,&quot; Sameer Samat, President of Android Ecosystem at Google, said.</p>

Glad you asked!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-the-galaxy-xr">What is the Galaxy XR?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is the first-ever Android XR headset, created by Google and Samsung. If Apple&#39;s Vision Pro is the &quot;virtual reality iPhone,&quot; the Samsung is basically its &quot;virtual reality Galaxy S phone&quot; alternative. The headset looks like a pair of snowboard goggles, but it comes with a whopping total of 12 cameras and six microphones. And because it&#39;s 2025, AI is a big part of the Galaxy XR&#39;s upsell: It has Google&#39;s Gemini AI assistant built in, so while you&#39;re wearing the headset, it can see and hear everything around you.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s &quot;XR&quot; designation stands for &quot;extended reality,&quot; which is effectively an &quot;all of the above&quot; term encompassing augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality.  That means the Galaxy XR can put a virtual overlay on the real world (thanks to all those cameras), or it can completely shut out your space to immerse you in a totally virtual environment. In other words, you can customize your own workspace or turn your room into your own personal theater, or you can transport yourself to an international locale with a first-person &quot;you are there&quot; viewpoint.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-can-you-do-with-the-galaxy-xr"><strong>What can you do with the Galaxy XR?</strong></h2>
<p>For watching videos on apps like YouTube, the headset offers a library of 180- and 360-degree VR content. You can also watch movies using Google TV on a large, resizable screen. Plus, if you have a question about whatever you&#39;re watching, you can ask Gemini since it sees everything you see. And when you&#39;re looking at your photos and videos, you can convert them to 3D so it feels like you&#39;re back in the memory.</p>
<p>While using Google Maps, you can use <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-adding-gemini-ai-powered-tools-to-maps-140045971.html"><ins>Immersive View</ins></a> to go anywhere in the world (virtually, of course). Visiting somewhere historical? You can ask Gemini to tell you more information about the landmark. Spot a weird-looking plant or bug around your house? You can use Circle to Search to find out what it is while wearing the headset.</p>

<p>As for getting work done efficiently, you can arrange your most-needed apps all around your screen — for instance, your web browser, favorite music app, important documents and video conferencing app. And if things start to feel cluttered, you can ask Gemini to organize your windows. Even better, you can link your PC to your headset, as well as your keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>The headset uses two passthrough cameras for real-time viewing, six world-facing tracking cameras and four eye-tracking cameras, as well as depth and flicker sensors. It also supports iris recognition so you can unlock the device and enter passwords within some apps.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-apps-work-on-the-galaxy-xr">What apps work on the Galaxy XR?</h2>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/why-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-can-support-almost-all-android-apps-021000889.html">&quot;Almost all&quot; Google Play Store apps</a> will be available on the Galaxy XR headset. That means hundreds of thousands of apps should be available on the headset on day one, including basic streaming apps (for watching things like Netflix, HBO Max or Peacock on that giant virtual display) as well as &quot;new versions&quot; of some of Google&#39;s key first-party software, from Photos to Chrome and YouTube. And, of course, the aforementioned Google Maps is on board, too.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/ea526da0-aef0-11f0-9f79-70d997379a5f" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/ea526da0-aef0-11f0-9f79-70d997379a5f" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Using the Galaxy XR as a PC monitor, you can stream in a game -- such as this " data-uuid="0a4ff9c2-bda6-3004-b57f-a14bbb3a6896"><figcaption>Using the Galaxy XR as a PC monitor, you can stream in a game -- such as this &quot;Assassin&#39;s Creed&quot; tile -- from an external source.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure>
<p>As you&#39;d expect, Google is also focusing on gaming. In addition to the full panoply of Android games, the Galaxy XR&#39;s PC Link also lets you use it as a monitor for PC-based games, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engadget&#39;s Sam Rutherford got some <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-a-smarter-more-open-take-on-apples-vision-pro-for-half-the-price-020044642.html">hands-on time with the Galaxy XR</a> recently, and had some notable first impressions on its comfort and usability:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t seems Samsung learned a lot from its rivals by including a much larger and thicker head cushion that helps distribute the weight of the headset more evenly. Granted, during a longer session, I still noticed a bit of pressure and felt relief after taking off the Galaxy XR, but it&#39;s nothing like the Vision Pro, which in my experience gets uncomfortable almost immediately. Finally, around back, there&#39;s a simple strap with a knob that you can twist to tighten or loosen the headband as necessary. So even without extra support running across the top of your head, getting in and out of the Galaxy XR is much easier and comfier than the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-is-the-galaxy-xr-different-from-the-apple-vision-pro">How is the Galaxy XR different from the Apple Vision Pro?</h2>
<p>While the headset may look pretty similar to the Apple Vision Pro, there are some bigger (and even better) differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, the Galaxy&#39;s micro-OLED display has 29 million pixels, compared to Apple&#39;s 23 million pixels, and a resolution of 3,552 x 3,840, which offers a tad more detail than Apple&#39;s model. Additionally, it has 96% of the DCI‑P3 color gamut, while the Vision Pro has 92%. However, Apple&#39;s headset beats out the Samsung on refresh rate, going a full 120Hz versus the Galaxy XR&#39;s 90Hz.</p>
<p>Since you&#39;ll be wearing it on your head for an extended period, you&#39;ll be relieved to know the Galaxy XR is a bit lighter than Apple&#39;s XR headset by 205g (0.5lbs).</p>
<p>On the battery life front, Samsung is pledging up to two hours of &quot;general use&quot; and 2.5 hours of video playback, whereas the new M5 Vision Pro runs 30 minutes longer in both modes, per Apple.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious operating system differences, of course, the aforementioned price delta is perhaps the biggest advantage Samsung has over the Apple model: At $1,600, you can get almost two full Galaxy XR units for every $3,499 Apple Vision Pro.</p>

<p>You can <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-order-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-020008173.html">order the Galaxy XR</a> now via <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung</a>. While that $1,800 price tag is formidable, Samsung is offering financing options. And the headset&#39;s price is actually less than that of Samsung&#39;s flagship <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> foldable phone. Key accessories like the Travel Case and Galaxy XR Controller usually cost $250 each, though both can be bundled in for $175 apiece.</p>
<p>There are additional incentives, too. For anyone buying the Galaxy XR before the end of the year, Samsung is throwing in the &quot;Explorer Pack&quot; at no extra charge. That includes a year&#39;s worth of Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium (including YouTube Music) and Google Play Pass; access to the new season of NBA League Pass; and access to the <em>NFL Pro Era</em> game, the Asteroid and Calm apps and Adobe&#39;s Project Pulsar, a 3D compositing app.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-everything-you-need-to-know-111532664.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-wireless-headphones-for-you">How to choose the best wireless headphones for you</h2> 
<p>When it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">Bluetooth</a> multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html">Spatial Audio</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html">Dolby Atmos</a>, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-over-ear-headphones">How we test over-ear headphones</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> 
<p>To judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-headphones-we-tested">Other wireless headphones we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-max">AirPods Max</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dyson-on-trac">Dyson On-Trac</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sonos-ace">Sonos Ace</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-ult-wear">Sony ULT Wear</h3> 
<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wh-ch720n">Sony WH-CH720N</h3> 
<p>While the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-ch720n-review-160032871.html">WH-CH720N</a> are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-studio-pro">Beats Studio Pro</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review-a-new-spin-on-a-reliable-formula-160009025.html">Bose’s latest flagship model</a> has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> 
<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">here</a>, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-headphones-faqs">Wireless headphones FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-can-you-tell-the-quality-of-wireless-headphones">How can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-choose-the-best-quality-wireless-headphones">How do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-brand-has-the-best-wireless-headphones">Which brand has the best wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>Sony consistently tops our list with <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">its 1000X line</a>. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">like Bose</a>, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-expensive-wireless-headphones-sound-better">Do expensive wireless headphones sound better?</h3> 
<p>Exorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">Bowers &amp; Wilkins’</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html">headphones</a> are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html">Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2</a> is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss]]></description>

It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last over 18hours (depending on what you're doing, of course).

<p>Engadget has been <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-20/">reviewing laptops for two decades</a>, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-we-test-laptops-203909669.html">testing</a> their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft's Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP's Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-a-laptop">Factors to consider when choosing a laptop</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-system-apple-windows-or-chrome-os">Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS</h3> 
<p>There's a good chance you've already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it's another story if you've become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.</p> 
<p>If you're an Apple-loyalist, there aren't many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple's <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">MacBooks</a>, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we've ever seen. They're incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you're used to iOS and iPadOS.</p> 
<p>That brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple's other platforms. You can't respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+Phone+Link+app&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvc3luYy1hY3Jvc3MteW91ci1kZXZpY2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvd2luZG93cy9zeW5jLWFjcm9zcy15b3VyLWRldmljZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf6ecThFK8UkL1n9MqlvWg-rE0x3ymgn2Y8PiFuAQZb1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fsync-across-your-devices" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/sync-across-your-devices">Microsoft's Phone Link app</a> lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone's photos.</p> 
<p>If cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.</p> 
<p>As for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.</p> 
<p>And what about ChromeOS? <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebooks</a> are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they're not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren't many apps or games that work offline, and they also don't work with powerful software suites like Adobe's (you can use the stripped-down <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/02/adobe-express-photoshop-google-chromebook-plus">Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools</a>, though).</p> 
<p>Chromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they're popular in schools because they're cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.</p> 
<p>If, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-chromebook-plus-initiative-pushes-higher-spec-standards-and-handy-software-tools-130055583.html">Chromebook Plus models</a> to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">company’s online AI features</a>, like AI image generation and photo processing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you're looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you're willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.</p> 
<p>I’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">the best budget laptops</a> that you can check out as well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-laptop-size-and-weight">Laptop size and weight</h3> 
<p>So how portable do you want your laptop to be? That's the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it's enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).</p> 
<p>If you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.</p> 
<p>For artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you'd expect, you'll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.</p> 
<p>If you're in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.</p> 
<p>You can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming systems</a> or souped-up workstations. They're not meant for mere computing mortals.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports-and-connectivity">Ports and connectivity</h3> 
<p>These days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple's MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you'll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft's Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-spectre-x360-14-review-2024-keeping-the-2-in-1-laptop-dream-alive-140045823.html">HP's Spectre x360 14</a>, as well as many models from ASUS.</p> 
<p>For gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.</p> 
<p>If you're a fan of wired headphones, it's worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that's a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it's still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.</p> 
<p>Most laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">routers</a> and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn't made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there <em>are</em> notebooks like the <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">Surface Pro 9</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-180044021.html">Samsung Galaxy Book</a> models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life"><strong>Battery life</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop's battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.</p> 
<p>If battery life is your absolute priority, I'd strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple's M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you'd expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-refresh-rate"><strong>Refresh rate</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop's refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we're seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)</p> 
<p>While high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we're seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-and-gpu">CPU and GPU</h3> 
<p>If you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems.</p> 
<p>You'll also see AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD's main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel's Arc hardware (though those are getting better).</p> 
<p>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-rebuilt-windows-11-around-ai-and-arm-chips-173152776.html">rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture</a>, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.</p> 
<p>As for Apple's laptops, you'll be choosing between the M4 Pro, M4 Max and M5, each of which is progressively more powerful.</p> 
<p>On the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop's display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD's chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA's RTX 40-series hardware or AMD's Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.</p> 
<p>Apple's M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD's lower-end dedicated GPUs. That's quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it's another reason we highly recommend Apple's notebooks.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ai-pcs-npus-and-copilot"><strong>AI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+</strong></h3> 
<p>Simply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).</p> 
<p>We were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html">AMD announced</a> in 2023. Intel unveiled its <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">"Core Ultra" CPUs</a> in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-8040-chips-remind-intel-its-falling-behind-in-ai-pcs-200043544.html">Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips</a> that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). But in May, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html">Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative</a>, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.</p> 
<p>Copilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-postpones-the-launch-of-its-controversial-recall-ai-feature-031554596.html">Recall</a>, which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-paint-is-getting-an-ai-powered-image-generator-that-responds-to-your-text-prompts-and-doodles-190653716.html">Cocreator in Paint</a>, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.</p> 
<p>If you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.</p> 
<p>At the time of this post, <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">Chromebook Plus notebooks</a> can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.</p>

<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html">ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition</a> is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.</p> 
<p>While the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14’s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. It’s mushier than we’d like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. You’ll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.</p> 
<p>Where the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-14-oled">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</h3> 
<p>Aside from its lovely OLED screen, the <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-14-oled-review-ai-pc-143054247.html">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</a> doesn't stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I'd recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-razer-blade-14">Razer Blade 14</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-2024-review-a-portable-but-pricey-powerhouse-specs-price-160020891.html">Razer Blade</a> has almost everything you'd want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it's far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it's certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-laptop-faqs">Laptop FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-average-battery-life-of-a-laptop-per-charge">What is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?</h3> 
<p>It’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-ram-do-i-really-need">How much RAM do I really need?</h3> 
<p>The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you <em>could</em> use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start.</p> 
<p>If you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-storage-capacity-for-a-laptop">What is the best storage capacity for a laptop?</h3> 
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB <a data-i13n="cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ssds-140014262.html">SSDs</a> (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.</p> 
<p>If you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.</p> 
<p>We recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-a-good-price-range-for-a-decent-laptop-in-2025">What's a good price range for a decent laptop in 2025?</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you'll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-macos-and-windows-which-is-better">What’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?</h3> 
<p>Simply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple's notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You'll also find Chromebooks running Google's ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.</p> 
<p>Debating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the '80s, so we won't be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.</p> 
<p>But if you care more about playing the newest games, you'll want to have a Windows system. If you're more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you're running an iPhone).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-laptop-brands">What are the best laptop brands?</h3> 
<p>There is no single "best" laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we're generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option that’s the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, <a data-i13n="cpos:45;pos:1" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52019024">dominate laptop sales worldwide</a>. We'd avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don't have a major presence in the US.</p>

It&#39;s working in collaboration with two eyewear companies, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-galaxy-xr-opening-new-worlds#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20its,play%20into%20daily%20life.">AI-powered smart glasses</a> to go up against Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban models, Samsung&#39;s head of customer experience Jay Kim <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/ITXJquX9FqM?t=6714">announced</a> at the end of the livestream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re also really excited about the AI glasses that we&#39;re currently building together with Google,&quot; Kim said. &quot;We&#39;re working with two of the most forward-thinking brands in eyewear, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, to introduce new devices that fit into your lifestyle.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung will focus on two different markets with those brands, though both will include &quot;cutting-edge&quot; AI features co-developed with Google. With Gentle Monster, it&#39;s developing &quot;fashion-forward&quot; glasses that will likely be aimed at the higher end of the market. The Warby Parker collaboration, meanwhile, will yield eyewear designed for general consumers, probably at a lower price point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung only said that the AI glasses will bring &quot;style, comfort and practicality&quot; to everyday life via Android&#39;s XR ecosystem. As we <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-xr-glasses-hands-on-lightweight-but-with-a-limited-field-of-view-213940554.html">saw in May</a> with Google&#39;s prototype XR smart glasses, it will likely employ a Gemini-powered display that will show notifications and small snippets of info from your apps, like the music you&#39;re listening to or turn-by-turn GPS directions. It should also have a built-in camera, of course, along with speakers and a microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design and appearance will also be key, but Samsung has yet to show any images of the upcoming smart glasses and didn&#39;t reveal a release date. However, it will have a tough climb against Meta&#39;s lineup given the Ray-Ban branding and that company&#39;s head start on the technology. Last week, Meta introduced  its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Ray-Ban Display model</a> that includes a screen for a true extended reality experience.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-is-working-on-xr-smart-glasses-with-warby-parker-and-gentle-monster-042632170.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-introduce-its-android-xr-headset-at-a-galaxy-event-on-october-21-230000605.html">is set to officially reveal</a> its long-anticipated Android extended reality (XR) headset, which has been codenamed Project Moohan. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-galaxy-event-worlds-wide-open-a-new-era-of-multimodal-ai">has scheduled a livestream event</a> for October 21 at 10PM ET. That&#39;s just a few hours away, which is pretty much nothing compared to the years of lead-up to this reveal since Samsung and its partners have been teasing this device.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The event will be streamed live via the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">company&#39;s YouTube page</a> and on the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">official Samsung Newsroom site</a>. We don&#39;t know how long the stream will be, but Samsung promises that Project Moohan will open up the &quot;true potential&quot; of mixed-reality devices. You can bookmark this page and watch it right here.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just a reveal for a mixed-reality headset. Moohan is the very first device that uses <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html">Google&#39;s new Android XR operating system</a>, which has been specifically designed for XR, VR and AR devices like glasses and headsets. Google has also shown previews of the ecosystem at its I/O developer conference before, and while we&#39;ve seen bits and pieces of the software (and hardware) before, the final pieces should be available with the keynote today.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have official specs about the headset itself, but there have been <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">plenty of leaks and rumors</a> that will be confirmed or refuted during the stream. Leaks <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/why-im-so-excited-for-samsung-android-xr-event-and-its-not-just-the-headset/">have suggested</a> it includes a high-end display, advanced tracking and Gemini integration. These same leaks indicate a potential price tag of $1,800 to $2,800, making it more of a rival to the Apple Vision Pro than <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Meta&#39;s new Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is designed to be a showcase for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Android XR</a>, Google&#39;s new AR / VR operating system, but unlike competing mixed reality headsets, Google says there will be few limits on the apps the Galaxy XR will actually be able to run. In fact, a Google spokesperson tells Engadget that &quot;almost all Android apps will automatically be made available without any additional development effort.&quot;</p><p>Obviously, Google and Samsung would love deliberately designed spatial experiences for their new hardware, but almost all existing Android apps, regardless if they were made for phones or not, will be considered &quot;Android XR compatible mobile apps&quot; once the headset launches. That means they&#39;ll run in a floating spatial panel that can be moved around the virtual space surrounding you, and per Google&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/android-xr#android-xr" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Android XR developer guidelines</a>, will automatically support core XR input methods like eye and hand tracking, along with the usual suspects like controllers, mice and keyboards. They should also run and look like they would on a smartphone or tablet. &quot;Apps that specify compact sizes show up accordingly and apps that allow for resizing can be resized in XR. These apps do not run in compatibility mode and won’t be letterboxed,&quot; Google says.</p><p>The only apps that won&#39;t make the cut are ones that require features a given Android XR device doesn&#39;t support, like GPS. And in the case of apps that are already updated to work on large screens, or that are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/adaptiveapps-io25.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">&quot;adaptive apps&quot;</a> designed to reflow and change size depending on the Android device they&#39;re running on, things will be even smoother. Google says adaptive design will be expected to be the default going forward, an effort that started with this year&#39;s release of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-16-is-out-complete-with-new-features-for-pixel-phones-including-live-notification-updates-170006935.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Android 16</a>. “Many APIs restricting size will be ignored on larger screens (which includes Android XR),” Google’s spokesperson said, because the company ultimately wants Android apps to feel responsive whether they’re on a phone, an in-car display or an XR headset.</p><p>Apple tried a similar, but more limited approach with the launch of visionOS and the Vision Pro by letting developers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-apps-will-publish-to-the-apple-vision-pro-store-by-default-183016666.html" data-i13n="slk:list their iOS and iPadOS apps;cpos:5;pos:1">list their iOS and iPadOS apps</a> in the visionOS App Store. The move produced mixed results, and a dearth of real visionOS apps. An app designed with a device in mind is better than one that&#39;s not, but Google does at least appear to have set Android developers up for a slightly smoother ride. Considering the Galaxy XR&#39;s cheaper price when compared to the Vision Pro, they might also have a bigger audience to make apps for, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/why-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-can-support-almost-all-android-apps-021000889.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">Vision Pro</a> was meant to usher in a new era for headsets. However, its high price and somewhat limited utility resulted in what may be the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://macdailynews.com/2025/03/10/the-apple-vision-pro-is-clearly-a-commercial-flop/">biggest</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/story/revisiting-the-three-biggest-flops-of-2024/">flop</a> in years. Now it&#39;s time for Samsung to give things a go with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR</a>. It&#39;s a fresh take on modern mixed reality goggles developed through deep partnerships with Qualcomm and Google and it attempts to address some of the Vision Pro&#39;s biggest shortcomings.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<div id="2d21abadac6841fbb681e3c699ef3e7c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJkbTave_I8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>While both Apple and Samsung&#39;s headsets have a lot of similarities (like their basic design and support for features such as hand and eye tracking), there are also some very important differences. First, at $1,800, the Galaxy XR is essentially half the price of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Vision Pro</a> (including the new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">M5-powered model</a>). Second, instead of Apple’s homegrown OS, Samsung&#39;s headset is the first to run Google&#39;s new Android XR platform, which combines a lot of familiar elements from its mobile counterpart but with a bigger emphasis on AI and Gemini-based voice controls. And third, because Samsung relied more on partners like Google and Qualcomm, the Galaxy XR feels like it&#39;s built around a larger, more open ecosystem that plays nicely with a wider range of third-party devices and software.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy XR fundamentally doesn&#39;t look that much different from the Vision Pro. It features a large visor in front with an assortment of 13 different exterior sensors to support inside-out tracking, passthrough vision and hand recognition. There are some additional sensors inside for eye and face tracking. There&#39;s also a connector for the wire that leads to its external clip-on battery pack alongside built-in speakers with spatial audio. The one big departure is that unlike the Vision Pro, the Galaxy XR doesn&#39;t have an outward-facing display, so it won&#39;t be able to project your face onto the outside of the headset, which is just fine by me.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/6635b790-aeb7-11f0-9bd7-4a2aefe1b25b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/6635b790-aeb7-11f0-9bd7-4a2aefe1b25b" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The Samsung Galaxy XR headset features dual micro OLED displays that deliver 4K resolution to each eye at up to 90Hz." data-uuid="796ffc9d-20eb-325e-bfd7-07c8f437eeeb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>However, the devil is in the details because while the original Vision Pro weighed between 600 and 650 grams (around 1.3 to 1.4 pounds) depending on the configuration (not including its battery pack), the Galaxy XR is significantly lighter at 545 grams (1.2 pounds). And that&#39;s before you consider the new M5 Vision Pro, which has somehow gone backwards by being even heavier at 750-800 grams (around 1.6 pounds). Furthermore, it seems Samsung learned a lot from its rivals by including a much larger and thicker head cushion that helps distribute the weight of the headset more evenly. Granted, during a longer session, I still noticed a bit of pressure and felt relief after taking off the Galaxy XR, but it&#39;s nothing like the Vision Pro, which in my experience gets uncomfortable almost immediately. Finally, around back, there&#39;s a simple strap with a knob that you can twist to tighten or loosen the headband as necessary. So even without extra support running across the top of your head, getting in and out of the Galaxy XR is much easier and comfier than the Vision Pro.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/98334370-aeb7-11f0-a65f-b5b61d5700e0" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/98334370-aeb7-11f0-a65f-b5b61d5700e0" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The side of the Galaxy XR features a connector for its battery pack and built-in spatial audio speakers. " data-uuid="5fad4744-9247-3b68-9ba7-a7fada6717f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>On the inside, the Galaxy XR is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip with dual micro OLED displays that deliver 4K resolution (3,552 x 3,840) to each eye at up to 90Hz. I wish Samsung was able to go up to a 120Hz refresh rate like on the Vision Pro, but considering the Galaxy XR&#39;s slightly higher overall resolution, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bothered. And I must say, the image quality from this headset is seriously sharp. It&#39;s even better than Apple&#39;s goggles and it might be the best I&#39;ve ever used, particularly outside of $10,000+ enterprise-only setups. Once again, when you consider that this thing costs half the price of a Vision Pro, this headset feels like a real accomplishment by Samsung to the point where I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the company is losing money on every unit it sells.</p>
<p>In terms of longevity, Samsung says that for general use the Galaxy XR should last around two hours. If you&#39;re only watching videos though, that figure is more like two and a half. Thankfully, if you do need to be in mixed reality for longer, you can charge the headset while it&#39;s being used. As for security, the Galaxy XR uses iris recognition to skip traditional passwords, which is nice.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-platform-android-xr">The platform: Android XR</h2>
<p>Sometimes, trying out a new software platform can be a little jarring. But that&#39;s not really the case for Android XR, which shouldn&#39;t present much of a learning curve for anyone who has used other headsets or Google&#39;s ubiquitous mobile OS. After putting the goggles on, you can summon a home menu with an app launcher by facing your palm up and touching your index finger and thumb together. From there, you can open apps and menus by moving your hands and pinching icons or rearranging virtual windows by grabbing the anchor point along the bottom and putting them where you want.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/cbc021e0-aeb7-11f0-b5ff-5f8d009a148d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/cbc021e0-aeb7-11f0-b5ff-5f8d009a148d" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Even without a top strap, the Galaxy XR is surprisingly comfortable thanks to a larger forehead cushion and less weight than the Apple Vision Pro. " data-uuid="e4ae10cc-4e7f-3c49-9714-2941246c0150"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Notably, while there is a growing number of new apps made specifically for XR, you still get access to all of your standard Android titles. Those include Google Photos, Google Maps and Youtube, all of which I got a chance to play around with during a 25-minute demo. In Photos, you can browse your pictures normally. However, to take advantage of the Galaxy XR&#39;s hardware, Google created a feature that allows the app to convert standard flat images (with help from the cloud) into immersive ones. While the effect isn&#39;t true 3D, it adds distinct foreground, midground and background layers to images in a way that makes viewing your photo roll just a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>In Maps, you start out with a view of the world before using hand gestures to move and zoom in wherever you want or voice commands to laser in on a specific location. The neat new trick for this app is that if you find bubbles over things like restaurants and stores, you can click those to be transported inside those businesses, where Android XR will stitch together 2D photos to create a simulated 3D environment that you can move and walk around in. Granted, this doesn&#39;t have a ton of practical use for most folks unless you want to take a virtual tour of something like a wedding venue. But, the tech is impressive nonetheless.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f6e709b0-aeb7-11f0-bfff-aa9c0b6d2627" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f6e709b0-aeb7-11f0-bfff-aa9c0b6d2627" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="This connector is where you connect the Galaxy XR&#39;s battery pack. Runtime is expected to be about two hours, or two and a half if you are only watching videos. " data-uuid="5dc7ee15-bf61-3d6f-b9ec-05dc4dfb25fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Finally in the YouTube app, the Galaxy XR did a great job of making standard 360 videos look even better. While quality will always depend on the gear that captured the content, viewing spatial clips was a great way to show off its resolution and image quality. Google says it will also put a new tab on the app to make finding 360 videos easier, though you can always watch the billions of standard flat videos as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you can use and navigate the Galaxy XR entirely with hand gestures, but voice commands (via Gemini) are also a major part of the Android XR platform. Because the goggles sit on your head, unlike with mobile devices, there&#39;s no need to use a wake word every time you want to do something. You just talk and Gemini listens (though you can choose to disable this behavior if you prefer), so this makes voice interactions feel a lot more natural. Because Gemini can also do things like adjust settings or organize all the apps you have open, in addition to answering questions, it feels like Google is starting to deliver on some of those Star Trek moments where you can simply ask the computer to do something and it just happens. Yes, it&#39;s still very early, but as a platform, Android XR feels much more like a virtual playground than VisionOS does at the moment.</p>

<p>While I didn&#39;t get to test these out myself, there are some other important features worth mentioning. In addition to apps, you can also play your standard selection of Android games like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or connect the headset to your PC (like with Steam Link) to play full desktop titles. Furthermore, I was told that the Galaxy XR can be tethered to a computer and used like a traditional VR headset. And while Samsung is making optional wireless controllers for the Galaxy XR (and a big carrying case), you may not need them at all as you&#39;ll also have the ability to pair the goggles with typical Bluetooth-based gamepads along with wireless mice and keyboards.</p>
<p>Google also says it&#39;s working on a new system called Likenesses that can create personalized avatars for use in video calls and meetings that use data from interior sensors to deliver more realistic expressions. Additionally, you&#39;ll be able to use tools like Veo3 to make AI-generated videos while providing prompts using your voice. But this is just scratching the surface of the Galaxy XR&#39;s capabilities and I want to use this thing more before offering a final verdict.</p>

<p>In many ways, the Galaxy XR looks and feels like a flagship mixed reality headset in the same vein as the Vision Pro, but for the Android crowd (and Windows users to some extent as well). On top of that, Google has done some interesting things with Android XR to make it feel like there&#39;s a much wider range of content and software to view and use. In many ways, the addition of a dedicated AI assistant in Gemini and voice controls feels much more impactful on goggles than a phone because you can&#39;t always count on having physical inputs like a mouse or keyboard. And with the Galaxy XR being half the price of the Vision Pro, Samsung and Google have done a lot to address some of the most glaring issues with Apple&#39;s rival.</p>
<p>In case the price drop wasn&#39;t enough, it feels like all the companies involved are doing as much as possible to sweeten the deal. I actually started laughing when I first heard all the discounts and free subscriptions that come with the headset. That&#39;s because in addition to the goggles themselves, every Galaxy XR will come with what&#39;s being called the Explorer Pack: 12 months of access to Google AI Pro, 12 months of YouTube Premium (which itself includes YouTube Music), 12 months of Google Play Pass, 12 Months of NBA League Pass and a bundle of other custom XR content and apps. So on top of a slick design, top-tier optics and a new platform, Google and Samsung are basically tossing a kitchen sink of apps and memberships in with the headset.</p>

<p>My only reservation is that when it comes to mass adoption, I think smartglasses have supplanted headsets as the next big mainstream play. Granted, there is a lot of technology and software shared between both categories of devices (Google has already teased upcoming Android XR smartglasses) that should allow Samsung or Google to pivot more easily down the line. But the idea that in the future there will be a headset in every home seems less likely every day. Still, as a showcase for the potential of mixed reality and high-end optics, the Galaxy XR is an exciting piece of tech.</p>

Costing just over half as much as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">Apple&#39;s reality machine</a>, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html">Galaxy XR</a> has a 4K micro-OLED screen and a 100-degree horizontal field of view. The $1,800 mixed reality headset is available now for pre-order on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung&#39;s website</a>.</p>
<p>The Galaxy XR isn&#39;t <em>only</em> a Samsung product. The company developed the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">long-rumored headset</a> alongside Google and Qualcomm. It&#39;s the first Android XR product, a line that will eventually include AI glasses &quot;and beyond.&quot; You can read more about the headset and its ecosystem in Engadget&#39;s news coverage.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><core-commerce id="1a1e453a8c324e18835d035512cc802f" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Given Google&#39;s connection to the Galaxy XR, it isn&#39;t too surprising that the company has bonuses for early orders. If you buy the headset before the end of 2025, you&#39;ll get &quot;The Explorer Pack.&quot; That includes a year of access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium and Google Play Pass. Also included until the end of the year is the &quot;XR Pack.&quot; This adds three months of YouTube TV, a year of NBA League Pass, NFL Pro Era, Adobe&#39;s Project Pulsar, Asteroid and Calm.</p>
<p>You can order the Galaxy XR now from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Samsung&#39;s website</a> and in Samsung Experience Stores. The headset costs $1,800. An optional Galaxy XR Controller costs $250. And somehow, the official Galaxy XR travel case also costs $250, which is — <em>yikes</em> — a lot. Perhaps consider waiting for third-party alternatives on the case front.</p>
<p>Samsung is offering a 24-month financing plan for the headset ($75.01 monthly) on its website. Meanwhile, Samsung&#39;s stores have that plan as well as a 12-month one ($149 monthly).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-order-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-020008173.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've known for a while that the first <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html">extended reality (or XR) headset</a> from Samsung and Google would debut in 2025. During <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/how-to-watch-samsung-unveil-its-android-xr-headset-184820772.html">an event on Tuesday night</a>, Samsung at long last shared more details about the first <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html">Android XR</a> device that you'll be able to purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company got really wild and original with the headset's name. You're truly not going to believe what it's called... Actually, it's got the most unsurprising name of all time: <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR</a>. What's more, you can <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=60780373-867a-4d35-9679-5a7dbd04ec1a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=buy+the+headset+right+now&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYwNzgwMzczLTg2N2EtNGQzNS05Njc5LTVhN2RiZDA0ZWMxYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUOS1LSpsSw51OEhe8g8xYCLMMzTx57wN70Ur347mc-R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/">buy the headset right now</a> in the US and Korea for $1,800. That's just over half of what the Apple Vision Pro costs.</p>

<p>Aside from an Android-powered headset that looks very much like an Apple Vision Pro, you might be wondering exactly what you'll be getting in return for forking over 1,800 smackeroos. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html">As expected</a>, Galaxy XR is powered by the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset. Qualcomm worked with Samsung and Google on the headset.</p>
<p>The micro OLED display has 29 million pixels (6 million more than the Apple Vision Pro), a resolution of 3,552 x 3,840 and 96 percent of the DCI‑P3 color gamut — four percent more than the Vision Pro. Where Apple does have Samsung beat on the display front is with the refresh rate: the Galaxy XR tops out at 90Hz and the Vision Pro can hit 120Hz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Galaxy XR has dual high-res passthrough cameras to support mixed reality use, six other external cameras for tracking things in the environment and two eye-tracking sensors. The device supports iris recognition for unlocking the headset and entering passwords in some apps. As with the Vision Pro, you can capture 3D photos and video using the headset.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/5bf711b0-aea9-11f0-b7fa-d4a3d3eb61e4" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/5bf711b0-aea9-11f0-b7fa-d4a3d3eb61e4" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="A look at the Galaxy XR headset from behind, with the device's optical lenses shown." data-uuid="05e6c9f7-ee43-3637-aa53-195be4bcf82a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The cameras allow for hand tracking and gesture control, though it's possible to operate Galaxy XR with physical controllers as well. If you prefer, you can pair a keyboard and mouse to the headset or link it to your PC and access your desktop that way.</p>
<p>The dual speakers support Dolby Atmos and there are six microphones built in. As for battery life, Samsung says you'll get up to two hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback on a charge. That matches the original battery life promises of the original Vision Pro, but Apple said its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">latest model</a> (which has the new M5 chipset) offers an extra 30 minutes or so of usage.</p>
<p>The interpupillary distance of the Galaxy XR's optics is 54~70mm, and it's possible to buy insertable prescription lenses if needed. As for connectivity, the headset supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. Even with a forehead cushion attached, Galaxy XR weighs 545g (1.2lbs), while the latest Apple Vision Pro has a minimum weight of 750g (1.7lbs). The Galaxy XR's battery pack — as with competitor's offerings, the battery is external — weighs 302g (0.7lbs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung claims the Galaxy XR was designed with comfort in mind. "The headset’s ergonomically balanced frame distributes pressure across the forehead and the back of the head, minimizing facial discomfort while providing steady support," the company said in a press release. There's also a detachable light shield that you can employ to block out external light.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-you-can-actually-do-with-galaxy-xr"><strong>What you can actually do with Galaxy XR</strong></h2>
<p>There are no prizes for guessing that Google's generative AI chatbot Gemini is at the heart of Android XR. "Android XR is the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era, and we are incredibly excited to take a significant leap forward today with the launch of Galaxy XR," Sameer Samat, Google's president of Android Ecosystem, said.</p>
<p>Every Google Play Store app works out of the box on the headset, though of course Google has reworked some for mixed reality. You can use Gemini to navigate Google Maps and ask for personalized recommendations while checking out 3D visuals with <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-adding-gemini-ai-powered-tools-to-maps-140045971.html">Immersive View</a>. Google Photos can bring an extra dimension to 2D photos and videos via auto spatialization.</p>
<p>On YouTube, you can ask Gemini to find videos and tell you more details about what you're watching. And, while using the passthrough mode, you can look at any object in your environment and use Circle to Search to look up more info about it. Google has also made new versions of Google TV, Chrome and Meet (because what is mixed reality for if not conference calls?) for Android XR.</p>
<p>Multitasking is a factor here as well. The operating system allows users to have multiple, resizable apps open at once. These can be arranged in a virtual space, or you can simply ask Gemini to do that for you.</p>
<p>On the entertainment front, you'll be able to stream shows and movies in 4K in a virtual theater setting. You'll have access to a library of 180-degree and 360-degree VR content, and you can view 3D content via a "spatial" tab. Some streaming platforms have reworked their apps for Android XR, including Crunchyroll, HBO Max and Peacock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a multi-view option for watching sports, with apps from the likes of MLB and Fox Sports available. With Adobe's Project Pulsar (an immersive video editing app), you'll be able to add 3D depth to videos and seemingly place captions behind subjects with ease, if that's something you're interested in.</p>

<p>Galaxy XR has games too. <em>NFL Pro Era </em>— an NFL-licensed virtual reality title that's also on Meta Quest, PlayStation VR and Windows — is available for Android XR. So too is <em>Inside [JOB]</em> by Owlchemy Labs (<em>Vacation Simulator, Job Simulator</em>). For compatible games, Samsung says Gemini can offer real-time coaching, tips and "enhanced gameplay experiences."</p>
<p>The arrival of Galaxy XR is an important next step for Google and its grand vision of an Android XR ecosystem. But the company isn't stopping with headsets. It's also making smart glasses, a product category that Meta has been trying to conquer. Samsung and Google are working with Warby Parker on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-demos-android-xr-glasses-at-io-live-translation-191510280.html">Android XR smart glasses</a>. At I/O earlier this year, we got some hands-on time with a prototype of <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-xr-glasses-hands-on-lightweight-but-with-a-limited-field-of-view-213940554.html">Google's Android XR glasses</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sovrn.co/1h5f52n">Galaxy XR will run you $1,800</a>, and Samsung is offering financing options. The Galaxy XR Travel Case and Galaxy XR Controller will each run you $250 — at those prices, they almost need financing options too. Ouch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who buys Galaxy XR by the end of this year will get an Explorer Pack at no extra cost. This includes 12 months of access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium and Google Play Pass. The <em>NFL Pro Era</em>, Project Pulsar, Calm and Asteroid apps are bundled in too. You'll also get NBA League Pass access for the 2025-26 season in the US or 12 months of the Coupang Play Sports Pass in Korea. Charging $1 for each of the first three months of YouTube TV seems a little cheap considering the outlay for Galaxy XR, but it's still a decent perk. YouTube TV typically costs $83 per month.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html?src=rss]]></description>

The camera is an update on a previous design that could capture footage at one billion frames per second, but it comes with a major caveat: it can only shoot one pixel at a time.</p><p>Haidet&#39;s camera is made from a gimbal-mounted mirror, two tubes, a simple lens, a light sensor and some Python code to tie it all together. Pointed at a laser pointer, the camera&#39;s able to capture a beam of light at two billion frames per second, showing it smoothly traveling between mirrors, with speeds that vary depending on where the camera is in relation to the laser pointer. &quot;Light moves about six inches, or 15 centimeters, per frame of this video,&quot; Haidet says. &quot;This beam of light is traveling at the Universe’s speed limit. Light in any reference frame will never move any faster or any slower than this speed.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/A_laser_pointer_at_2_billion_fps_makes_the_speed_of_light_look..._kinda_weird_4-46_screenshot.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/A_laser_pointer_at_2_billion_fps_makes_the_speed_of_light_look..._kinda_weird_4-46_screenshot.png" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Brian Haidet explaining how he tiled pixels together to create footage of light traveling." data-uuid="360225ce-322c-44b6-a3bd-5982e6a2750d"><figcaption>Pixels had to be tiled together to create what looks like normal video footage.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Brian Hadet</div></figure><p>While it&#39;s theoretically possible to create a more traditional camera that can capture footage at two billion frames per second, as Haidet explains, you can&#39;t do it with the tools most people have in their garage. His solution was to capture one pixel at a time, and then tile that footage together to create something viewable. According to Haidet, &quot;if all these videos are synchronized and we take many, many, many, one pixel videos, we can tile these videos next to each other and play them all back at the exact same moment and give something that looks like a video.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While it&#39;s not the same thing as a true two billion frames-per-second camera, &quot;that&#39;s just a significantly more expensive way to do it,&quot; Haidet says, &quot;and it really wouldn&#39;t get us any better of a result.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/someone-made-a-camera-that-can-shoot-at-two-billion-frames-per-second-202259391.html?src=rss]]></description>

A Los Angeles judge ruled that the three men will need to testify in the trial set to begin in January, <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/meta-instagram-snap-social-media-child-safety.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">according to</a> <em>CNBC</em>.</p><p>&quot;The testimony of a CEO is uniquely relevant, as that officer’s knowledge of harms, and failure to take available steps to avoid such harms could establish negligence or ratification of negligent conduct,” Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl wrote. As <em>CNBC</em> points out, the January trial will be closely watched as it&#39;s the first of many lawsuits alleging harms to young social media users that will head to trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Lawyers for Meta and Snap had argued that the executives should be spared from testifying at the upcoming trial. Meta&#39;s lawyers reportedly argued that forcing testimony from Zuckerberg and Mosseri would &quot;set a precedent&quot; for future trials.

In a statement, the law firm representing Snap said that the judge&#39;s order &quot;does not bear at all on the validity of Plaintiffs claims&quot; and that they &quot;look forward to the opportunity to explain why Plaintiffs&#39; allegations against Snapchat are wrong factually and as a matter of law. &quot;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-adam-mosseri-and-evan-spiegel-ordered-to-testify-in-trial-over-social-media-addiction-190500907.html?src=rss]]></description>

This week the UK government issued new guidance backing headteachers in prohibiting the use of mobile phones throughout the school day, including at break times. Many schools around the country are already prohibiting mobile phone use over concerns. The amount of time children spend on screens each day rocketed during the Covid pandemic by more than 50 per cent, the equivalent of an extra hour and twenty minutes. Researchers say that unmoderated screen time can have long-lasting effects on a child&#39;s mental and physical health. Recently TikTok announced that every account belonging to a user below age 18 have a 60-minute daily screen time limit automatically set. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)]]></media:description>

While the streamer has primarily specialized video game adaptations, the belief in post-<em>Barbie</em> Hollywood is that any recognizable IP could be the source of a future TV show or movie.</p><p>In <em>Catan</em>, players are tasked with collecting resources and building out a civilization on a remote island, with multiple ways to win or obstruct fellow players from doing the same. It&#39;s not too hard to imagine the game being converted into some kind of competitive reality TV show, though apparently animated and live-action narrative<em> </em>projects are also on the table. &quot;Anyone who has played <em>Catan</em> knows [that] the intense strategy and negotiation at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,&quot; Jinny Howe, Netflix&#39;s head of scripted series for the US and Canada, shared in the press release announcing the deal.</p><p>Whichever <em>Catan</em> project ultimately heads into production, Netflix says it&#39;ll be produced by Darren Kyman from Asmodee, Pete Fenlon from Catan Studio, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber, the sons of <em>Catan</em> creator Klaus Teuber. If Asmodee sounds familiar, it might be because Netflix has partnered with the publisher in the past. <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, another Asmodee published game, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/monopoly-netflix-game-show-bake-off-1236556296/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">was adapted</a> into both a mobile game for Netflix Games and an animated series with the help of its original creators.</p><p><em>Catan</em> joins <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/monopoly-netflix-game-show-bake-off-1236556296/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a <em>Monopoly</em> adaptation</a> and several shows based on video games at Netflix, including the recently released <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-animated-series-arrives-on-october-14-145632934.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></a> and an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-takes-a-leap-of-faith-on-an-assassins-creed-series-153958591.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">upcoming series</a> based on the Assassin&#39;s Creed franchise.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-adapting-catan-into-movies-and-tv-shows-185133712.html?src=rss]]></description>

The decision was made due to slowing demand in the EV market, as hundreds of Brightdrop vans <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:USA TODAY;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4c97c3fe-896f-4ba9-9311-97cca850ce43&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=USA+TODAY&amp;linkText=have+begun+piling+up+in+dealer+lots&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyNS8wMy8yOS9nbS1zdG9yaW5nLWVsZWN0cmljLXZhbnMtbWljaGlnYW4vODI3MDA5NDEwMDcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0Yzk3YzNmZS04OTZmLTRiYTktOTMxMS05N2NjYTg1MGNlNDMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI1LzAzLzI5L2dtLXN0b3JpbmctZWxlY3RyaWMtdmFucy1taWNoaWdhbi84MjcwMDk0MTAwNy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASdNoUUDr4GsssGPwVD0lFmE3oNPOKCrhlRbaKBRTYLU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fbusiness%2F2025%2F03%2F29%2Fgm-storing-electric-vans-michigan%2F82700941007%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2025/03/29/gm-storing-electric-vans-michigan/82700941007/">have begun piling up in dealer lots</a>.</p>
<p>“This is not a decision we made lightly because of the impact on our employees,” CEO Mary Barra said in the earnings call. “However the commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected, and changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives has made the business even more challenging.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those changes to the regulatory framework she mentions likely refer to the recent disappearance of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html">federal EV tax credit</a>. The policy offered prospective buyers a $7,500 tax credit and was supposed to wind down in 2032, but the Trump administration killed it back in September as part of the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill. Brightdrop vans were also eligible for a $7,500 rebate for commercial EVs under 18,000 lbs, which went away along with the tax credit.</p>
<p>In other words, Brightdrop electric vans are simply too expensive for most consumers. They started at $74,000. The double discount brought the starting price down to $59,000, but that&#39;s gone now. Additionally, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-van-143144512.html">rival Ford&#39;s E-Transit van</a> starts at $51,600.</p>

<p>GM first launched the Brightdrop vans back in 2021, and this seemed to be a serious attempt to capture the commercial EV market. The company made its own <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-truck-ep1-delivery-business-fedex-153325067.html">fleet management software</a>  and inked deals with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-gm-brighdrop-ev-order-193935301.html">Walmart</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fedex-gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-vans-140050680.html">FedEx</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-will-buy-175000-e-vs-from-gm-over-the-next-five-years-173032998.html">others</a>. Money is money, however, and not too many commercial customers have an extra $15,000 laying around to make up for those lapsed credits and rebates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/gm-to-end-production-of-its-chevy-brightdrop-electric-vans-183622673.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s war of words with Europe over its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> is bleeding into the court system. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/apple-attacks-eu-crackdown-in-digital-law-s-biggest-court-test">reports</a> that the company criticized the regulations at the General Court in Luxembourg. The European Commission is currently <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/consultation-first-review-digital-markets-act-2025-07-03_en">conducting</a> its first formal review of the law. Apple lawyer Daniel Beard told the court reviewing the DMA that it &quot;imposes hugely onerous and intrusive burdens.&quot;</p>
<p>The language echoes Apple&#39;s go-to framing of the regulations as an anti-consumer, anti-privacy hardship on the nearly $4 trillion company. &quot;Over time, it&#39;s become clear that the DMA isn&#39;t helping markets,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/the-digital-markets-acts-impacts-on-eu-users/">wrote</a> in a September blog post. &quot;It&#39;s making it harder to do business in Europe.&quot; Apple even cited porn as one of the law&#39;s alleged dangers. &quot;For the first time, pornography apps are available on iPhone from other marketplaces — apps we&#39;ve never allowed on the App Store because of the risks they create, especially for children.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also claimed the DMA caused it to delay several features. These include <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-use-live-translation-with-airpods-144837882.html">AirPods Live Translation</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-mirror-your-iphone-on-macos-sequoia-130003743.html">iPhone Mirroring in macOS</a>, and the Visited Places and Preferred Routes features in Maps.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-repeats-its-long-held-criticism-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-130058440.html">asked the EC to repeal the law</a> in September. In response, the commission essentially <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-tells-apple-it-has-no-intention-of-repealing-the-digital-markets-act-175950691.html">told the company to shove it</a>. &quot;Apple has simply contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application,&quot; EU spokesperson Thomas Regnier said. He added that the EC had &quot;absolutely no intention&quot; of ditching the law.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Apple is challenging the DMA on three fronts. First is its requirement that <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eu-gives-apple-six-months-to-make-cross-device-interoperability-easier-140030456.html">rival hardware (like earbuds and smartwatches) work with the iPhone</a>, which Apple claims is a security risk. The company also objected to <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-app-store-rules-are-still-in-violation-of-eu-policy-161117662.html">the App Store&#39;s inclusion under the rules</a> and a probe into whether iMessage should have been included.</p>
<p>In response, EC lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal highlighted Apple&#39;s immense power in Europe. He said the company&#39;s &quot;absolute control&quot; over the iPhone has led to &quot;supernormal profits&quot; in markets where competitors can&#39;t possibly compete on equal footing.</p>
<p>&quot;Only Apple has the keys to that walled garden,&quot; Loewenthal told the court. &quot;It decides who gets it and who can offer their products and services to iPhone users. And through such control, Apple has locked in more than a third of European smartphone users.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-steps-up-its-attacks-on-europes-dma-regulations-175332390.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI&#39;s long-rumored browser has a name, and you can try it out today — provided you&#39;re an Apple user. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://chatgpt.com/atlas">ChatGPT Atlas</a> is available to download on macOS, with the company promising to bring it to Windows, Android and iOS soon. Atlas integrates ChatGPT directly within the browser interface, allowing users to engage with the chatbot while they&#39;re surfing the web — no need to jump between different tabs or copy and paste content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you select a text field, an icon will appear that allows you to prompt ChatGPT. OpenAI demoed this feature in Gmail where an employee asked the chatbot to polish an email he was writing to a colleague. Naturally, a prompt bar will also appear when you open a new tab, and you can open a sidebar where you can converse with ChatGPT at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2cc92e9a7ed4414aa82a07d7045a1a4a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej6hnsQgV_c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>The more you use Atlas, the more ChatGPT will &quot;remember&quot; about your preferences. One of the benefits of this is that you&#39;ll be able to more easily filter through your search history. For instance, you can write &quot;re-open the shoes I looked at yesterday,&quot; and ChatGPT will know the specific website you want to look at again. Browser memories are optional, and if you decide to enable the feature, you can manage them through the settings menu, and just like any other browser, you can delete your history or go surf the web using an incognito mode. OpenAI also says it won&#39;t use the content users browse to train its future models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atlas also includes an agent mode where ChatGPT can surf the web for you and complete tasks. The feature builds on the Operator tech <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-operator-can-surf-the-web-for-you-210029243.html">debuted at the start of the year</a>, and is currently available as a preview within the browser that Plus, Pro and Business accounts can try out. &quot;It can help you book reservations or flights or even just edit a document that you’re working on,” said Adam Fry, product lead for ChatGPT Search, during the livestream where OpenAI announced Atlas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Tabs are great but we haven&#39;t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,&quot; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the start of the livestream. “This is just a great browser all-around — it’s smooth, it’s quick, it’s really nice to use.”</p>
<p>Rumors that OpenAI was working on its own web browser first surfaced in July. With today&#39;s announcement, the company joins an already competitive market. A number of companies, including <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/operas-new-fully-agentic-browser-can-surf-the-web-for-you-145035874.html">Opera</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-is-available-now-for-200-per-month-180955616.html">Perplexity</a>, released their own &quot;agentic&quot; browsers earlier this year. Of course, then there&#39;s also Google, which plans to integrate its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-in-chrome-no-longer-requires-a-subscription-170045611.html">Gemini AI assistant</a> more deeply into Chrome, the world&#39;s most popular browser, over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas-launches-on-macos-today-170735742.html?src=rss]]></description>

It&#39;s introducing AI-enhanced audio for better sound quality during calls. The company says this will ensure &quot;optimized audio quality for every call, so you can confidently take calls from a windy park or busy cafe.&quot; This feature rolls out sometime in November.</p>
<p>Google Fi is getting HD/HD+ calling, which should also improve the overall audio quality. The service will soon automatically connect to Wi-Fi when available, with the company touting &quot;seamless, secure switching.&quot; As for security, each call and text goes through a VPN. There&#39;s no extra cost for this service and it doesn&#39;t count against the pre-existing data allocation.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform will also soon let users make calls and send texts from any web browser. This is coming in December and will feature a new interface with full RCS support, allowing folks to add hi-res photos and videos to message threads.</p>
<p>Finally, Google is integrating Gemini into the platform to create an AI-powered billing summary. The company says this offers &quot;simple, easy explanations of all your billing statements.&quot; The feature has been in a beta for a while and Google says users have given it &quot;high positive sentiment.&quot;</p>
<p>These tools are accompanied by a limited-time promo for new subscribers, amounting to 50 percent off for 15 months when bringing in a phone. The discount is only available for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=307dcc7c-5375-42e1-b3c1-4cab0a845e00&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Unlimited+Premium+and+Unlimited+Standard+plans&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2ZpLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vYWJvdXQvcGxhbnMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwN2RjYzdjLTUzNzUtNDJlMS1iM2MxLTRjYWIwYTg0NWUwMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9maS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2Fib3V0L3BsYW5zIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaQAUYHFAhrkxqXsoXhaLypBvcaFVa9aQRu8fOz4T8eU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffi.google.com%2Fabout%2Fplans" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://fi.google.com/about/plans"><ins>Unlimited Premium and Unlimited Standard plans</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-fi-will-start-using-ai-to-make-calls-sound-better-170025805.html?src=rss]]></description>

Instead, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html">dumped all</a> of its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html">new M5 devices</a> on us with a few press releases, a clear sign that there's not much to celebrate this year. But while the new 14-inch MacBook Pro appears to be more of the same on the surface, it also features an impressive graphics upgrade that makes it a decent choice for gaming. And it retains everything I already love about the MacBook Pro: It's still a well-designed machine that's sturdy, fast and offers tons of battery life.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-whats-new-in-the-m5-macbook-pro"><strong>What's new in the M5 MacBook Pro</strong></h2> 
<p>The star of the show is Apple's new M5 chip, which sports a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU and 16 Neural Engine cores. While the company claims it's 20 percent faster than the M4 for multi-threaded applications, the biggest upgrade is the GPU, which is up to 60 percent faster when it comes to games and professional apps. The <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-and-16-inch-review-2024-brace-yourself-for-m4-speed-140057584.html">M4 was no slouch</a> when it came to gaming and media rendering, but the M5 is a more tempting upgrade for anyone using an M1 MacBook Pro or older.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="74eccb67-af38-40fb-b70f-e884923a718b" /> 
<p>Otherwise, it's like I said: more of the same. There's the 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display which offers up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits of HDR, as well as ProMotion’s smooth 120Hz refresh rate. (Unfortunately, we’ll likely have to wait until next year for an OLED option.) The aluminum case is still rock solid, and the excellent keyboard and trackpad haven't changed a bit. Last year's 12MP Center Stage webcam also makes a return, along with the superb six-speaker sound system.</p> 
<p>The port situation is also solid. On top of the MagSafe 3 charging connection, there are three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a full-sized SDXC card reader, HDMI and a headphone jack. (It would be nice to see a gigabit Ethernet port though. That's the one accessory I still regularly connect to almost every laptop.)</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-in-use-the-best-gets-even-better"><strong>In use: The best gets even better</strong></h2> 
<p>Before I get to the benchmarks and other performance metrics, it's worth pointing out just how pleasant the 14-inch MacBook is to use. Its aluminum frame is smooth to the touch, its screen is bright enough to use in direct sunlight and it always feels blazing fast. While its 3.4-pound frame is noticeably heavier than the 2.7-pound MacBook Air, it's still easy to travel with. And you can certainly tell that the additional weight translates into raw power, especially as you start to stress the MacBook Pro and hear its fans gently spin up. While the MacBook Air is built to be as thin as possible, the MacBook Pro is built to get work done (and look good while doing so).</p> 
<p>Based on my testing with popular benchmarks and a few games, the M5 MacBook Pro is noticeably faster than the M4 model in tasks that rely on the GPU and NPU. Otherwise, though, it's hard to tell a difference when it comes to basic tasks like booting into macOS, browsing the web and dealing with email. My review unit was equipped with 32GB of RAM, so it had a bit more breathing room than the base model with 16GB of memory. (Pro tip: If you're planning to keep the MacBook Pro for four years or more, it makes sense to get at least 32GB of RAM. You can't upgrade the memory down the line like older laptops, since it's baked directly into the M5 chip.)</p>

<p>In Geekbench 6, the M5 MacBook Pro was around 500 points faster than the M4 model in single-threaded tasks, and nearly 3,500 points faster for complex multi-threaded work like video rendering. Thanks to the M5's new graphics hardware, it also tested far better in the Geekbench 6 GPU test, reaching around 11,00 points faster than the M4. I noticed a similar result in Cinebench 2024: The M5 MacBook Pro's CPU scores were slightly better than before, but the GPU score was nearly twice as fast as the M4.</p> 
<p>For real-world gaming performance, I turned to <em>Lies of P</em>, which also surprised me with some major leaps. With the M4 MacBook Pro, I could only get a steady 60 fps with the highest graphics settings in 1080p. With this M5 model, I was able to play at the highest resolution (3024 by 1890) between 70 and 75 fps. It was even smoother as I scaled down the resolution: The MacBook Pro hit 85 to 95 fps in 1,440p and up to 140 fps in 1080p. Those results are in line with what I'd expect from a gaming notebook that costs well over $2,000, which is in line with the $2,200 retail cost of our review unit.</p>

<p>I still wouldn't recommend a MacBook Pro for anyone who wants to play tons of games, but it's heartening to see Apple making progress on that front. There are more new AAA games hitting the app store, and the M-series chips are fast enough to run most of them well. But the M5 is the first time I'd consider Apple's hardware equivalent to a PC running a video card like NVIDIA's RTX 5070.</p> 
<p>The M5 MacBook Pro retains the impressive battery life from the previous model, reaching 34 hours and 30 minutes while looping an HD video. I could also use it for more than two full days of work with nothing much stressing the GPU. And once again, the MacBook Pro never feels very hot, even under an intensive workload. The fans are audible, but they don’t get as annoying as the helicopter-like fans from the old Intel MacBook Pros.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-should-you-buy-the-m5-macbook-pro"><strong>Should you buy the M5 MacBook Pro?</strong></h2> 
<p>If you're looking for a powerful laptop that can handle most heavy-duty workloads, the MacBook Pro will certainly suit your needs. But the difficult choice now is deciding between this 14-inch M5 model, the existing M4 Pro and Max systems, or waiting a few months for the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. If you're rendering video and 3D content all day, you're likely better off working with Pro and Max chips, but you'll have to wait several months to see the new M5 options. If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip). But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>As you can probably guess from its name, Baseus’ power bank has a 5,000mAh capacity and is Qi2-certified. In our testing. It gave our tester iPhone 15 a 43 percent bump in battery in 42 minutes, which returned the phone to 91 percent. It has a curved design and is wrapped in soft silicone, making it easy to grip in a pinch.</p> 
<p>As a reminder, MagSafe charging is supported on iPhone 12 models and later, though you’ll need an iPhone 13 or later to reach the 15W charging speed on a third-party Qi2 accessory such as the one featured in this deal.</p>

The company says it's the "thinnest e-paper frame available" that is "designed to join a gallery wall or stand alone." Aura isn't kidding here. This thing is just 0.6-inches thick.</p> 
<p>One of the primary pain points of traditional digital photo frames is that many require constant power via an outlet. This creates an aesthetic problem, as one has to figure out a place to tuck away a power cord. Some modern frames operate via battery, but they don't last all that long.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Aura Ink, however, features a rechargeable battery that powers the device for three full months. That's a really good metric and is likely due to the decreased power demands of e-ink.</p> 
<p>There's another problem that Aura looks to have solved here. Color e-paper has a limited palette with access to just six different hues. That's just the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/tech/detail/How_it_works">nature of the technology</a>. This doesn't always make for the most pristine images.</p> 
<p>The company is getting around this limitation via a proprietary dithering algorithm that "expands the appearance of the display’s six-color ink system into millions of tones, creating the illusion of full-color photographs." I haven't gotten a look at this frame in real life, but the marketing images look gorgeous.</p>

<p>There's also an integrated front light that highlights photos. The company says this light has been designed to boost contract and automatically adjusts to ambient conditions. It also shuts off at night because the opposite would be kind of creepy.</p> 
<p>The Aura Ink ships with a wall-mount and a tabletop stand. Now onto the bad news. This is high-end technology with a high-end price tag. The frame costs $500. Aura is a reputable company, however, as its Carver Mat model topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-digital-frame-120046051.html">best digital picture frames</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It felt like half of the internet was dealing with a severe hangover on October 20. A severe Amazon Web Services outage took out many, many websites, apps, games and other services that rely on Amazon’s cloud division to stay up and running. That included a long list of popular software like Venmo, Snapchat, Canva and <em>Fortnite</em>. Even Amazon's own assistant Alexa stuttered, and if you were wondering why the internet seemed to be against you — you weren't imagining it. The good news is that, Amazon <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">announced</a> by 6:53PM ET on October 20 that it resolved the "increased error rates and latencies for AWS Services."</p>
<p>The company said it "identified the trigger of the event as DNS resolution issues for the regional DynamoDB service endpoints." It ran into more problems as it tried to solve the outage, but it was eventually able to fix everything. "By 3:01 PM [PT], all AWS services returned to normal operations," it said.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At about 4:30PM ET on October 20, things seemed to be returning back to normal. Apps like Venmo and Lyft, which were either slow to respond or completely nonresponsive before, were appearing to behave smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of 1:15PM ET on October 20, multiple services were unavailable, including asking Alexa for the weather or to turn off lights in your home. The Lyft app was also slower to respond than usual, and Venmo transactions were not completing.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS service health page</a> at the time, Amazon was looking into "increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services" in the US-EAST-1 region (i.e. data centers in Northern Virginia) as of 3:11AM ET on Monday. By 5:01AM, AWS had figured out that a DNS resolution issue with its DynamoDB API was the cause of the outage. DynamoDB is a database that holds info for AWS clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At about 12:08PM ET, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-service-disruptions-outage-update">posted a small statement</a> that reiterated the above and added that the "underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT." According to the notice, some Amazon "customers still continue to experience increased error rates with AWS services in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region due to issues with launching new EC2 instances." Amazon also said Amazon.com and Amazon subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer service support operations have been impacted.</p>
<p>“Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data,” Mike Chapple, a teaching professor of IT, analytics and operations at University of Notre Dame, told <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/amazon-tech-outage-10-20-25-intl?post-id=cmgz331910000356o8os98qu2"><em>CNN</em></a>. “It’s as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia.”</p>
<p>As of 6:35AM, AWS said it had fully mitigated the DNS issue and that "most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now." However, the knock-on effect caused issues with other AWS services, including EC2, a virtual machine service on which many companies build online applications.</p>
<p>At 8:48AM, AWS said it was "making progress on resolving the issue with new EC2 instance launches in the US-EAST-1 Region." It recommended that clients not tie new deployments to specific Availability Zones (i.e. one or more data centers in a given region) "so that EC2 has flexibility" in picking a zone that may be a better option.</p>
<p>At 9:42AM, Amazon noted on the status page that although it had applied "multiple mitigations" across several Availability Zones in US-EAST-1, it was "still experiencing elevated errors for new EC2 instance launches." As such, AWS was "rate limiting new instance launches to aid recovery." The company added at 10:14AM that it was seeing "significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region." Even once all the issues are resolved, AWS will have a significant backlog of requests and other factors to process, so it'll take some time for everything to recover.</p>
<p>Many, many, many companies use US-EAST-1 for their AWS deployments, which is why it felt like half of the internet was knocked offline on Monday morning. As of mid-morning, tons of websites and other services were sluggish or offering up error messages. Outage reports for a broad swathe of services spiked on Down Detector. Along with Amazon's own services, users reported issues with the likes of banks, airlines, Disney+, Snapchat, Reddit, Lyft, Apple Music, Pinterest, <em>Fortnite, Roblox </em>and <em>The New York Times </em>— sorry to anyone whose <em>Wordle</em> streaks may be at risk.</p>
<p>Sites like Reddit have posted their <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.redditstatus.com/">own status updates</a>, and though they don't explicitly mention AWS, it's possible that the services' paths may cross somewhere in the pipelines.</p>
<p>AWS offers a lot of useful features to clients, such as the ability for websites and apps to automatically scale compute and server capacity up and down as needed to handle ebbs and flows in traffic. It also has data centers around the world. That kind of infrastructure is attractive to companies that serve a global  audience and need to stay online around the clock. As of mid-2025, it was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">estimated</a> that AWS' share of the worldwide cloud infrastructure market was 30 percent. But incidents such as this highlight that relying on just a few providers to be the backbone of much of the internet is a bit of a problem.</p>

<p>This is the guy that made the Super Smash Bros. franchise. He loves making long videos about minutiae in his games. Just about every character on the <em>Super Smash Bros.

<p>Now our choice for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">best portable charger for Android</a> is even more tempting, thanks to a 36 percent markdown. The Anker Nano Power Bank is down to $19 from $30 in the USB-C model. The discount is available in the classic Black or White and the more fun colors Ice Lake Blue, Lilac Purple and Sprout Green.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>You can use Anker's Nano Power Bank with devices such as the iPhone 15 and newer, Samsung S22 and S23 series, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">AirPods</a> and the iPad Pro or Air. It's good for a quick boost: we found that its 5,000mAh battery can charge a depleted Galaxy S23 Ultra to 65 percent in about an hour. It also has four indcator lights on it that show how much it's charged.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is reportedly moving towards an era of unprecedented automation that would put half a million jobs in the US at risk. According to a series of interviews and internal documents referenced in an extensive report from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Amazon executives expect to sell twice as many products by 2033. But by scaling up its robotics operations believe it could avoid the 600,000 hires it would otherwise have to make to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>According to the report, documents show that the ultimate aim of Amazon’s in-house robotics department is to automate 75 percent of all operations, and if it is successful in making 160,000 fewer hires by 2027, the company would reportedly save 30 cents on each item it packs and delivers to customers in the US. Amazon recently <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-million-robots-ai-foundation-model"><ins>celebrated deploying</ins></a> its 1 millionth robot, a fleet it has been adding to since unveiling its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/proteus-amazon-first-fully-autonomous-warehouse-robot-074341277.html"><ins>first</ins></a> fully autonomous mobile robot in 2022.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite already pushing ahead with building warehouses that employ few humans, the<em> NYT </em>report claims that Amazon is planning for the eventual impact on affected communities and the potential backlash by participating in local events to establish a reputation as a &quot;good corporate citizen.&quot; The internal documents also discuss the avoidance of terms such as &quot;automation&quot; and &quot;AI&quot; in relation to robotics, suggesting instead that executives use terms like “advanced technology” instead. They even consider replacing using &quot;cobot&quot; instead of &quot;robot&quot; as the former implies a collaborative relationship with humans.</p>
<p>In a statement to the<em> NYT</em>, Amazon called the plans it cited incomplete and not reflective of its overall hiring strategy. It denied that its community efforts were related to its automation plans and said it’s not insisting that its executives refrain from using certain terms. The company added that it planned to hire 250,000 people for the imminent holiday season, but wouldn’t say how many of these would be permanent hires.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/new-report-leaks-amazons-proposed-mass-automation-plans-144822790.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yet another streaming platform is asking people to dig deeper into their wallets and pay more to keep using the service. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-max-prices-increases-plans-2025-1236557671/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">jacked up the prices</a> of all HBO Max plans, 16 months after the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/max-just-raised-subscription-prices-again-160849334.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">last increase to the ad-free offerings</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The entry-level, ad-supported plan is now $11 per month (an extra $1) or $110 per year ($10 more). HBO Max Standard will run you an extra $1.50 per month at $18.49 or $15 per year at $185 for the annual plan. As for the HBO Max Premium option, subscribers will now have to pay $23 per month (up by $2) or $230 for an annual plan (an increase of $20).</p><p>The new prices kick in immediately for newcomers. Existing monthly subscribers will start paying more as of November 20 (whenever their next billing cycle starts on or after that date). Yearly subscribers will be notified about the price changes 30 days before their plan renews.</p><p>WBD CEO David Zaslav <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-is-going-to-get-a-lot-more-expensive-ceo-promises-221656560.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">suggested in September</a> that price increases were on the way, along with a stricter <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/max-implements-8-extra-member-charges-on-all-subscription-plans-195228707.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">crackdown on password sharing</a>. &quot;The fact that this is quality — and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality — we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,&quot; Zaslav said. &quot;We think we’re way underpriced.&quot;</p><p>The company announced the price increases on the same day that Disney is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-prices-are-increasing-in-october-yes-again-171830091.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">making several Disney+ plans more expensive</a>. As it happens, some of the Disney+ bundles that are going up in price include HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><p>News of the price hikes comes just as WBD sticks a For Sale sign out on its lawn.

WBD has now confirmed that &quot;multiple parties&quot; have expressed interest in buying some or all of the company, and that it&#39;s now conducting &quot;a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.&quot;</p><p>In June, WBD <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-will-split-into-two-media-giants-144553585.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">announced plans</a> to split into two companies.

Discovery Global will have all of the other live cable channels, such as CNN, HGTV, Cartoon Network, Discovery and TLC (it will also be saddled with the lion&#39;s share of WBD&#39;s debt). That split is slated to take place by mid-2026, but WBD said on Tuesday it would consider other options.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The Warner Bros. Discovery Board will evaluate a broad range of strategic options, which will include continuing to advance the company&#39;s planned separation to completion by mid-2026, a transaction for the entire company or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses,&quot; WBD said <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">in a press release</a>. &quot;As part of the review, the company will also consider an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders.&quot; </p><p>WBD hasn&#39;t set a deadline or timetable for completing this review. But given the whole <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-is-back-hbo-max-says-121537812.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">HBO Max naming debacle</a>, it might take the board quite a while to make its mind up.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-is-getting-even-more-expensive-starting-today-143939446.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is partnering with Perplexity to bring the startup’s AI Search engine to its smart TVs. If you own a 2025 Samsung TV, you can start using the app today. The company will bring the software to older 2024 and 2023 sets later this year via an OTA update. As part of today’s announcement, Perplexity is also offering free 12-month subscriptions to its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352901-what-is-perplexity-pro" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Pro plan</a>. To redeem the offer, you’ll need to scan the QR code that appears within the new app. </p><p>As mentioned, Perplexity is an AI search engine. Before <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-search-will-do-the-legwork-for-you-171912610.html" data-i13n="slk:OpenAI;cpos:2;pos:1">OpenAI</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-claude-chatbot-can-now-search-the-web-too-183501166.html" data-i13n="slk:Anthropic;cpos:3;pos:1">Anthropic</a> and others added similar capabilities to their chatbots, Perplexity’s offering was novel, giving users a way to search the web more deeply than even Google allowed at the time. Things have gotten even more competitive in recent months, with Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html" data-i13n="slk:recently going all in on AI Mode in Search;cpos:4;pos:1">going all in on AI Mode in Search</a>. Still, if you want to try different, it’s worth seeing what Perplexity has to offer. The company’s Samsung TV app allows users to both type and use their voice to ask questions. </p><p>No matter how you slice it, this is a curious partnership. Perplexity doesn’t have a great reputation, even when you consider the broader AI industry.  In August, Cloudflare accused the company of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-is-allegedly-scraping-websites-its-not-supposed-to-again-211110756.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">scraping websites it wasn’t supposed to be</a>. Later that same month, two of Japan’s largest media companies <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-sued-by-japanese-media-giants-for-stealing-information-and-presenting-false-information-133048116.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">sued the company for copyright infringement</a>, alleging it not only stole information from them but also attributed falsehoods to them. And just last month, Merriam-Webster sued Perplexity as well, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-definition-of-copyright-gets-it-sued-by-the-dictionary-213408625.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">again alleging copyright infringement</a>. </p><p> </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-made-a-tv-app-and-its-coming-to-samsung-sets-143000479.html?src=rss]]></description>

Like that iPad Air, there’s a new chip on board here. It’s the M5, which was also added to the 14-inch MacBook Pro and Vision Pro. There are new Apple-designed networking chips: the N1 handles Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread, while the C1X handles 5G connectivity. Both of those chips debuted <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">in the iPhone Air</a> last month, so this is the first time they’re in an iPad. Finally, the iPad Pro supports fast charging for the first time; you can get to a 50 percent charge in about 30 minutes using a 60W power adaptor.</p> 
<p>Compared to the redesign Apple introduced with the M4 iPad Pro in 2024, this is very much a minor spec bump. It makes sense for Apple to ensure the iPad Pro has its most performant chips as soon as they are released. If you’re charging customers upwards of $1,000 for an iPad Pro, it had better be on the bleeding edge. (The 13-inch iPad Pro I'm testing with 1TB of storage and 5G connectivity costs $2,099, plus the $349 Magic Keyboard.)</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As such, the iPad Pro M5 is fairly easy to understand. Want a new iPad Pro? You’re now getting exactly what Apple offered a week ago, plus some impressive performance gains for specific tasks. Almost no one who bought an M4 iPad Pro should upgrade to this one, but anyone using an older model will find a ton to appreciate here.</p> 
<p>And while the hardware hasn’t radically changed, iPadOS has. The recent iPadOS 26 release introduced an entirely new multitasking system, a significantly improved Files app and more support for background processes, to name just a few of the highlights. Those things are best appreciated on a powerful device with a large screen like the 13-inch iPad Pro M5 I’m reviewing here. For years, the question that has dogged the iPad Pro is when its software would match up to its undeniably impressive hardware. I think the combo of iPadOS 26 paired with this hardware is a winner, but as always the price is going to be a sticking point.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-m5">M5</h2> 
<p>As mentioned, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">the M5 chip</a> is the big change for the iPad Pro, and if you’re coming from a device older than last year’s M4 model you can expect a big performance increase when you start pushing the envelope of what you can do.</p> 
<p>Before getting into the nitty gritty, here’s a rundown of what’s different from last year. Probably the most significant change is that the M5’s GPU now includes a “neural accelerator” on each of its 10 cores, an architectural tweak that’ll unsurprisingly give the chip more muscle when using the GPU for AI-related tasks. Beyond the neural accelerators, the GPU is also up to 30 percent faster in graphics performance, and the third-generation ray-tracing engine here is up to 45 percent faster in apps using ray tracing.</p>

</figure> 
<p>The standard CPU cores (four performance, six efficiency) are also faster than last year’s model, though less dramatically so. That’s not a surprise, as each successive M-series chip has gotten similar modest performance gains over the years. (Note that the iPad Pros with 256GB or 512GB of storage only get three performance cores. They also come with 12GB of RAM compared to the 16GB in configurations with more storage, but that’s more than the 8GB of RAM in the last generation’s equivalent options.) The Neural Engine has been upgraded, as well. Apple is also promising big gains in memory bandwidth, which now hits 153GB/s (nearly 30 percent higher than on the M4). Finally, read/write speeds to storage are up to two times faster than in last year’s model.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Doing some benchmarking with the Geekbench 6 and Geekbench AI apps show the expected major gains for GPU and AI performance. Single-core and multi-core CPU tests with Geekbench 6 come in at about 15 percent and 10 percent better than the iPad Pro M4, but GPU performance has increased more than 32 percent.</p> 
<p>Things are more dramatic when you look specifically at the Geekbench AI results. The app offers three scores (single precision, half precision and quantized) and can be run on three different chip backends (CPU, GPU and Neural Engine). When running the CPU- and Neural Engine-based benchmarks, the M5 only bested the M4 by single-digit percentages. But when using the GPU, the M5’s single-precision score was 22.4 percent better than the M4. Half precision and quantized performance was even more impressive — the M5 scored 85 percent and 101 percent better than the M4, respectively.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story this tells is that unless you’re hitting your GPU hard with AI tasks, the M5 isn’t massively better than the M4. Not a huge surprise, and most people who shelled out for an iPad Pro in the last 18 months should still be plenty happy with their purchases. But those GPU scores show off exactly where the M5 can stretch its wings compared to its predecessor.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As I’ve only had the iPad Pro M5 for less than a week, I’m still comparing the M4 to M5 iPad Pro on specific AI-focused tasks and in certain apps and will update this review with more details later this week.</p> 
<p>The caveat with all of this is that while the M5 is incredibly powerful, it’s also overkill for most things that people are going to use an iPad for. An iPad Pro with the M2 chip from 2022 still feels plenty responsive for most standard tasks that don’t require exceptional speed or power. Yes, there are definitely people buying an iPad Pro and maxing out its impressive capabilities, and those who do so will appreciate the performance here. But for everyone else, the M5 alone isn’t going to change how you use the iPad Pro on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-hardware-and-display-are-still-stunning">Hardware and display are still stunning</h2> 
<p>Anyone upgrading from an iPad Pro older than last year’s M4 model is in for a treat far beyond sheer performance. The iPad Pro M5 is physically identical to the prior one, but that doesn’t matter because I think this is still the single most impressive device Apple makes. I went deep into the many changes Apple made last year <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">in my review of the iPad Pro M4</a>, and everything I said there still applies.</p> 
<p>But to recap, the iPad Pro is extremely portable despite its performance chops. Apple made it about 20 percent thinner and about a quarter-pound lighter than the iPad Pro models Apple sold from 2018 through 2023. This radically improves the experience of using it. If you’re holding it like a tablet, the 13-inch model is now light and thin enough to be comfortable for extended use without having to put it down. Doing anything with the on-screen keyboard while holding it is still pretty awkward and the 11-inch option still feels like the best size for hand-held tasks. But the 13-inch iPad Pro I’m reviewing is noticeably easier to hold than the iPad Air because of its reduced weight and slimmer profile.</p> 
<p>The only complaint I might have about that thinness is it prevents Apple from shoving a bigger battery in here. The iPad Pro M5 gets the same 10-hour battery life rating (for surfing the web or watching videos) that every iPad has gotten since the tablet was released in 2010. But in recent years, Apple has, to some degree, stopped focusing on making every device as thin as possible at the potential expense of things like performance or battery life. Clearly, performance isn’t an issue here. But the same people who value extended battery life in a thicker device when using things like the MacBook Pro might feel the same here.</p>

<p>That’s a valid opinion, but a tablet is meant to be held in your hands and carried around with you even more so than a laptop, so I understand why Apple values portability over extending the iPad Pro’s battery life. Plus, the iPad Pro M5’s fast-charging capabilities make it pretty easy to extend its life. Using Apple's <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-iphone-charger-dynamically-switches-between-40-and-60w-123053563.html">new 40W Dynamic Charger</a> that can automatically step up to 60W, I got from 23 percent to 70 percent in 35 minutes. That’s a tad slower than the 50 percent charge in 30 minutes Apple claims, but we’re well within the “close enough” range.</p> 
<p>One thing I didn’t get to test last year with the iPad Pro M4 was its durability. The tablet’s extremely thin design reminded people of past Apple devices that had had some issues with flexing. After over a year with the previous iPad Pro, I’m not at all worried about this one. I’ve taken an iPad Pro M4 all around the US and internationally with no issues. Granted, it’s usually in its keyboard case, but I’ve also traveled with it in the basic Smart Folio Apple sells and have seen no evidence of bending. I also don’t remember seeing any reports about durability issues from owners over the last 18 months, so I wouldn’t worry about its long-term durability.</p> 
<p>I don’t have a great read on how long the iPad Pro M5 lasts away from its charger just yet — in the first few days with a new device it’s often downloading a lot of data from backups and doing some optimizing, thus not giving you a great feel for how long it’ll usually last. But so far, performance seems similar to the iPad Air M3 and iPad Pro M4 I’ve reviewed recently. I was getting between seven and eight hours while using the Magic Keyboard, and I’m guessing that I’ll blow past the 10-hour estimate when watching locally-stored video. More details on that to come.</p>

<p>Performance, check. Design, check. The third thing that continues to impress me about the iPad Pro is its screen. It quite simply has the nicest display I have ever seen on a portable device, be it a laptop, phone or tablet. Apple’s tandem OLED display (two OLED panels layered on top of each other) is the same in all respects as it was last year. That means the 13-inch screen has a 2,752 x 2,064 resolution (264 ppi) and standard brightness that can hit 1,000 nits, or up to 1,600 nits peak for HDR content. Aside from the OLED display, the only display improvements the iPad Pro has that the iPad Air doesn’t is ProMotion support for 120Hz refresh rates as well as a nano-texture glass option for the 1TB and 2TB models.</p> 
<p>To be clear, though, the iPad Pro’s screen is in a completely different ballpark than the one on the iPad Air. Between the much faster refresh rate, high brightness levels, completely dark blacks and wonderful contrast, there’s no question this screen far surpasses what you’ll find on any other iPad. Professionals who do detailed work in video, photography, drawing with the Apple Pencil Pro or graphic design will appreciate all of these features. But it also makes something like kicking back on a plane to watch a movie more enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-ipados-26">iPadOS 26</h2> 
<p>In last year’s iPad Pro M4 review, I wrote: “Apple has shown no indication it’s going to make iPadOS more like a Mac.” As such, I recommended people not buy an iPad Pro unless they were happy with the limitations that have been inherent to iPadOS for a long time. It took Apple until this summer, but its latest updates rendered my earlier words invalid. With iPadOS 26, Apple pretty much said “screw it” and addressed nearly every big software complaint users have had.</p> 
<p>As a quick refresher: apps still open in full screen by default, but you can now grab the corner and resize it to any shape you see fit; you can then stack up as many windows as you want in that view. Apps are also much better at remembering their size and position on your screen than ever before. If you swipe up and dismiss all the apps you’re working with and then re-open one, it’s right in the same place you left it. If you want to throw something back in full-screen, the familiar “stoplight” controls from the Mac are available for easy window management.</p> 
<p>You can swipe up and hold for a second from the bottom of the screen to enter Expose, which shows every open window in your view. Swiping right shows all the full-screen apps you have open. If you have an app in full screen, you can switch back to a windowed app that’ll just float on top of what you’re working in. There’s also a menu bar at the top of the screen that makes it easy to access advanced controls for whatever you’re using.</p> 
<p>As I said when I first started testing out iPadOS 26 in the summer, the end result of all these changes is that your iPad (no matter which kind) will feel significantly more capable with this software update. And there are other features that power users will appreciate, like a significantly improved Files app. Since it’s easier to have multiple windows, moving things around or dragging and dropping things into apps is a lot simpler. And there are improved sorting options as well, while PDFs finally open in the new Preview app rather than within Files .</p> 
<p>Background task capabilities have also been significantly expanded. For example, Final Cut Pro can now render video in the background, whereas before, switching to a different app would put the lengthy and intensive process on pause. And developers can tap into this API to use it for their own apps, too.</p> 
<p>I can’t say for sure that this will answer all the complaints of various iPad Pro owners out there, but I think Apple has gotten about as close as it can without just putting macOS on the device and calling it a day. Even with the big updates to iPadOS, an iPad Pro isn’t for everyone. Plenty of people will still choose a traditional laptop. But the iPad has always offered a pretty unique blend of power and portability, and with better software it’s a more viable option than ever.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>My viewpoint on the iPad Pro hasn’t changed since last year. I still find it a wildly impressive device that is unlike much else you can buy. Just like the last model, it has Apple’s newest chip, the best display Apple has made (aside from its $5,000 Pro XDR monitor) and a physical design that feels almost impossible given how much technology is crammed inside. It’s truly delightful, and it’s even more capable than before thanks to the combination of iPadOS 26 and the M5 chip.</p> 
<p>However, I still can’t stomach that price. $1,299 for a 13-inch iPad with 256GB of storage, no 5G connectivity and no Magic Keyboard is a <em>lot</em> of money, even if it is as capable as a similarly-priced laptop. Given the incredible technology inside of the iPad Pro, I can understand why it’s so expensive. And it's powerful enough that some buyers will be able to use it for three, four, even five years before they feel the need to update, which makes the up-front investment a little less burdensome. It's not the kind of device you need to replace annually, that's for sure. But unless you are going to use it as your main computer —&nbsp;all day, every day —&nbsp;and know exactly what benefits you’ll get from the iPad over a more traditional laptop, you’re probably better off buying an iPad Air and saving yourself a lot of money.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-shutting-down-its-desktop-messenger-app-202539375.html">Meta</a> is launching new tools aimed at trying to protect Messenger and WhatsApp users from potential scams. The company says its teams have &quot;detected and disrupted&quot; nearly 8 million accounts associated with scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines since the beginning of 2025. It has also taken action on over 21,000 Pages on Facebook pretending to be customer support services of legitimate companies. But much still needs to be done to squash scams, specifically those <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/us-attorneys-general-band-robocalls-055620761.html">targeting the elderly</a> who may not be as tech-savvy or may not be aware of the scammers&#39; latest schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On WhatsApp, the company will start showing users warning notices if they attempt to share their screen with someone not on their contacts list during a video call. Scammers sometimes get their targets to share their screens in order to steal sensitive information. In the warning window pictured below, Meta tells users outright to only share their screens with people they trust, since they will be able to see anything displayed on their phones, including their banking info.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company is also testing advanced scam detection tools in Messenger chats for mobile. When a user receives a potentially scammy message, a warning notice will pop up, telling them the message is suspicious and that they can forward it to Meta for an AI review. If Meta AI detects a potential scam, it will show the user a list of common scam signs, such as job offers in exchange for money, job offers promising fast cash and work from home offers for jobs that can&#39;t possibly be done remotely. It also reminds users not to wire transfer money or send gift cards, which are very common methods scammers use to steal money from their victims. At the bottom of the page, users will have the option to report and block the account that sent them the message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta didn&#39;t say when the new Messenger warning tool will roll out widely. For now, it&#39;s encouraging users to set up passkeys for quick identity verification and to run Security Checkup to review their security settings and get recommendations, including updating their passwords.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-warn-whatsapp-and-messenger-users-against-scams-120048067.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re not a big fan of the, well, glass in iOS 26&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">Liquid Glass interface</a>, Apple has apparently heard you. The latest iOS 26.1 Beta 4 has a new toggle that lets you apply a &quot;tinted&quot; setting to boost the opacity of elements and add contrast, making them stand out better against the background, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/20/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-toggle/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> reported. &quot;Choose your preferred look for Liquid Glass. Clear is more transparent, revealing the content beneath. Tinted increases opacity and adds more contrast,&quot; the description states.</p>
<p>The new toggle (Settings &gt; Display and Brightness on iPhone or iPad and System Settings &gt; Appearance macOS) is a rare instance of Apple altering course on a design based on user input. The company said the setting was added as many beta users desired a more opaque option for Liquid Glass. That&#39;s putting it mildly, as you may have noticed on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/search?q=%23liquidglass">social media</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1njqlo5/ios_26s_liquid_glass_design_draws_criticism_from/">Reddit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The setting is more noticeable on some areas of iOS than others. Toggling it from clear to tinted changes everything throughout iOS and affects apps and lock screen notifications as well. Other new changes in the latest beta include a Camera swipe toggle, a new slide-to-stop feature for alarms and timers, Settings updates, new Apple Intelligence languages and a new Apple TV app icon. If you&#39;re in the beta program, you can download the latest version now.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-261-beta-4-lets-you-make-liquid-glass-frosted-110021700.html?src=rss]]></description>

Your humble narrator’s Ring Chimes started turning their night lights on and off entirely at random, with no prompting from yours truly.</p>
<p>The company has already fixed the DNS issue that caused the outage, but a failure like this, which knocks out so damn much of the internet, should serve as a reminder. After all, having so many critical systems in the same basket means that when something goes wrong, a lot of the internet stops working. All at once.</p>

<p>It’s teeth-grindingly frustrating that Meta seems to be the company that has worked out how to make a truly transformative pair of smart glasses. Karissa Bell has <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">reviewed its new Ray-Ban Display and has plenty of praise for so much of what it can do</a>. You should read her exhaustive review to learn more, but the biggest barriers to adoption are size and price. But you can bet your bottom dollar the second or third generation of these are going to be a smash hit. At least until Meta gets rocked by another scandal that prompts people to deactivate their accounts.</p>

The review site has updated Yelp Assistant, its chatbot to answer users&#39; questions, rolling the tool out for all business categories. Its responses will draw on information from the business&#39; website as well as posts by other Yelp users. The chatbot will also remember past queries and preferences when it&#39;s used for finding services. Saved information can be managed in the Yelp app under Yelp Assistant memory settings.</p>
<p>Yelp has been pushing more artificial intelligence into its platform, adding <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/yelp-adds-ai-powered-scores-to-business-pages-195131103.html"><ins>Review Insights</ins></a> in December and announcing <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/yelp-will-use-ai-to-help-restaurants-answer-calls-and-make-phone-reservations-143320476.html"><ins>calling features</ins></a> in April. The AI-powered calling is rolling out in the company&#39;s fall update as Yelp Host and Yelp Receptionist. Yelp Host is specifically for table-service restaurants, and promises the ability to take reservations, change bookings and capture special requests. It is available now starting at $149 a month, or $99 a month for customers with a Yelp Guest Manager plan. Yelp Receptionist can manage calls for any &quot;eligible local businesses.&quot; Subscriptions to this AI-powered service start at $99 a month and will begin rolling out this week.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are several other updates from Yelp, but one of the more interesting ones is Menu Vision. With this resource, pointing your camera at a restaurant&#39;s menu will show photos of the dish in question along with reviews about that particular item. Menu Vision will arrive on the iOS and Android apps this week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/yelp-is-getting-more-ai-including-an-upgraded-chatbot-110051320.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-an-action-camera">What to consider before choosing an action camera</h2> 
<p>Action cameras have certain traits that separate them from regular cameras or smartphones. The most important is ruggedness that makes them resistant to water, dust and shocks. Most models are now waterproof without the need for a separate enclosure. At the same time, you can purchase housing accessories to make them waterproof to even greater depths.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Video quality is also key. Every model we recommend goes to at least 4K 60fps, but some models like GoPro’s latest <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/gopro-hero-13-black-release-date-price-hands-on-impressions-130027978.html">Hero 13</a> boost resolution up to 5.3K 60fps, or even 8K 30fps with the Insta360 Ace Pro 2. That allows you to crop in on shots and capture vertical video at higher resolutions for social media. And for slow-mo, you’ll want at least 120 fps video, preferably at 4K or at least 2.7K.</p> 
<p>Another nice feature is log video that improves dynamic range when filming on sunny, contrasty days. And if you film in dim environments, you’ll want the largest sensor possible for the best low-light performance.</p> 
<p>Next is the question of flat versus 360 video. 360 cams have become incredibly popular lately because they capture video all around the camera, even above and below. Then, you can reframe the shots in post, cutting from a cool bike trick to your reaction, for example. Or, you can post the entire 360 video online and let the audience choose which angle they want to see.</p> 
<p>For activities with bumps and jolts like mountain biking, stabilization is incredibly important. You want your video to look smooth, but still convey the thrill and speed of the action. Cameras from DJI, GoPro and Insta360 are all good in this regard, but GoPro’s Hero 13 still tops the list.</p> 
<p>Some action cameras are easier to handle and use, so take that into account as well. You’ll want bright and colorful displays both front and back, buttons you won’t have to fumble to find and easy-to-use menus. Remote control is another factor that can ease operation. And you’ll want to check which software is available to improve stabilization, edit video, remove selfie sticks and more.</p> 
<p>Size has also become a factor, with tiny cameras having become an all-new category recently. Mini sized models like Insta360’s Go 3S and Go Ultra, along with DJI’s new Osmo Nano, let you separate the camera from the display for maximum portability. Whether it’s mounted on a hat or your chest, you’ll barely notice it’s there.</p> 
<p>Then there are accessories. Do you need helmet or chest mounts, waterproof housings or battery charger? GoPro has the largest number as it’s been around the longest, but DJI and Insta360 now have a solid accessory lineup and both make handy wireless mics that connect directly with their cameras. And of course, battery life is critical for action shooting as it’s hard to change one when you’re out surfing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-action-camera-130017459.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Home products company Kohler is launching a new Kohler Health division, and its first product is a $599 camera for your toilet. The item, dubbed Dekoda, is equipped with sensors that analyze whatever liquid or solid waste goes into the toilet bowl with &quot;validated machine learning algorithms.&quot; The data, which can offer insights on hydration and gut health as well as detecting the presence of blood, then goes to Kohler Health&#39;s iPhone app, although Android support is in the works. It comes with a magnetic charging pad and a wall-mounted remote that can optionally use Bluetooth fingerprint authorization so that you don&#39;t learn way more than you want to about your guests.</p>
<p>I must salute the PR person who came up with this gem from the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kohler-co-launches-kohler-health-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-health-and-wellness-in-the-home-302584350.html"><ins>release</ins></a>: &quot;By turning the bathroom into a connected, data-informed health and wellness hub, Kohler Health empowers individuals to turn ordinary routines into proactive, personalized experiences.&quot; Because who doesn&#39;t want to be proactive about pee? Health data is great, no arguments here. But this seems like a pretty extreme and expensive way to figure out if you&#39;re drinking enough water. Maybe I&#39;m in the minority with my skepticism, however, because this isn&#39;t the first instance we&#39;ve seen of toilet-bowl tech for better health. Withings introduced a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-urine-monitoring-device-ces-2023-010057961.html"><ins>monitor</ins></a> a few years back for analyzing urine streams, which you can buy for a mere $500.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re just that passionate about tracking your biometrics, Dekoda products are expected to ship starting tomorrow. You&#39;ll also need to sign up for a Kohler Health subscription on top of the product cost, and there are individual and family plan options.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kohlers-dekoda-is-600-camera-for-your-toilet-225942144.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>X is finally following through on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-reportedly-soliciting-people-to-buy-recycled-user-handles-for-50000-174504242.html">long-rumored</a> plans <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/XHandles/status/1979714053221257393">to sell</a> old user handles, and some of the most sought-after usernames could fetch millions of dollars. The company shared more details about and opened a waitlist for its &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://handles.x.com/">handle marketplace</a>,&quot; that will enable paying subscribers to request and buy &quot;inactive&quot; handles.</p>
<p>According to the company, X will make two types of &quot;inactive&#39; handles available: &quot;priority&quot; usernames that may include &quot;full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations&quot; and &quot;rare&quot; handles that consist of &quot;short, generic, or culturally significant names.&quot; Subscribers to X&#39;s Premium+ and Premium Business tiers will eventually be able to request some &quot;priority&quot; handles as part of their subscription. The company says @PizzaEater and @GabrielJones are possible examples of such handles. Notably, this process requires what essentially amounts to an indefinite subscription to X Premium, as the company says it will revoke priority handles if an account&#39;s subscription lapses.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4d0ca239f1454d4d8e8ac7d787a30ac4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The X Handle Marketplace is our industry-first solution to redistribute handles that are no longer in use. <br><br>Eligible Premium subscribers will be able to search and make requests, with both complimentary and paid options available.</p>— Handle Marketplace (@XHandles) <a href="https://twitter.com/XHandles/status/1979714053221257393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>The process for acquiring a &quot;rare&quot; handle is a lot less clear. X says that it will offer some rare handles through &quot;public drops&quot; and that those will be given away for free &quot;based on merit&quot; and that multiple users will be able to apply. X will take a user&#39;s engagement and &quot;past contributions&quot; to the platform into account when deciding who gets these handles. The company will also make some handles available for sale via an invitation-only process. These prices will be &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;determined by a number of factors including popularity of word, character length, and cultural significance.&quot; These usernames could include common one-word usernames like @one, @fly or @compute, according to examples provided by X. They could also be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Some handles are included with a Premium+ or Premium Business subscription,&quot; X wrote in an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://handles.x.com/how-it-works">FAQ</a>. &quot;Others – especially Rare handles – may be priced anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.&quot; People who buy a supposedly rare handle will need to have a Premium+ or Premium Business subscription in order to start the process, but won&#39;t be required to maintain one in order to keep the handle.</p>
<p>In a separate &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://legal.x.com/en/x-handle-transfer-agreement.html#:~:text=Confidential%20Information%20does%20not%20include,you%20may%20have%20with%20X.">handle transfer agreement</a>,&quot; X describes its handle-buying scheme as an &quot;evolving initiative&quot; that it hopes will be adopted by other social media companies in the future. &quot;We are establishing a new standard for social media handles—a framework we hope the broader industry will adopt, similar to how Community Notes has influenced online transparency,&quot; the company wrote.</p>
<p>Andrew Allemann, the publisher of Domain Name Wire, a publication that tracks the domain name industry, says that there are some similarities between X&#39;s plan to sell handles and the marketplace for expired domains. &quot;For a long time, people have been buying and selling handles off of X, and X hasn&#39;t been getting a cut of that,&quot; he told Engadget. &quot;So in some ways, I think this will get some of the better handles to be more used on the platform.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said he would have concerns about some of the terms in X&#39;s policies, which allow it to &quot;reclaim&#39;&#39; handles if they become inactive. The company&#39;s current &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-x-accounts">inactive account policy</a>&quot; defines an inactive account as one that hasn&#39;t been logged into for 30 days. &quot;I would definitely want a firmer contract if I were to pay money for a handle,&quot; Allemann says. &quot;I would want some rights baked into a contract that says it can&#39;t just be taken away. I certainly want a longer period of inactivity before it can be taken away.&quot;</p>
<p>X also has a history of commandeering desirable handles from users that <em>were</em> actively using them. The company took the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190824506/the-man-who-once-tweeted-as-x-wasnt-informed-when-the-company-took-over-his-hand">@X handle</a> from a San Francisco photographer in 2023 without compensating him, though he was offered &quot;merch&quot; and a tour of X&#39;s headquarters. That same year, it also took the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/x-commandeers-music-handle-from-user-with-half-a-million-followers.html">@music handle</a> from a longtime user with more than a half million followers. Last year, the company swiped the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musk-takes-america-x-handle">@America</a> handle from a reported Donald Trump critic. The handle is now used by Musk&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/america">super PAC</a>.</p>
<p>X&#39;s plan to give away handles based on &quot;merit&quot; raises additional questions about who the platform could decide to reward and penalize. The company didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Allemann says that all social media users should remember they don&#39;t own any of the content they publish on company platforms. &quot;If you create your website, you control it, and people can always come to it. On social media, the single billionaire owner of it could decide they don&#39;t like you, and it&#39;s pretty much within their rights to kick you off, or demote you, or change the algorithm to impact you as well.&quot;</p>

The team at the company&#39;s Chelsea campus were notified on Sunday that a possible bed bug infestation had been discovered in the building and were told to remain at home so the location could be treated. As if working over the weekend wasn&#39;t enough of a bummer. Fortunately, exterminators collected their bug bounty, and employees were allowed to return to the building on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Google told employees to file a report if they had symptoms of bed bug bites or saw evidence of bed bugs on site, according to an email sent by the company and obtained by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-beg-bug-infestation-at-googles-manhattan-offices/"><em>Wired</em></a>. They were also told to contact professional exterminators if they accidentally brought bed bugs home; hopefully Google foots the bill for those unlucky people.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <em>Wired</em>&#39;s sources, the infestation may have been caused by &quot;a number of large stuffed animals&quot; in the Google office, but the publication wasn&#39;t able to confirm that.

<p>Are you still using Windows 10 on your desktop or laptop? If so, you need to know this: As of October 14, Microsoft moved the software to its "end of life" phase. What that means is that while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. That leaves you with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html">three options</a> to make sure your computer remains secure:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>You can <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-new-computers-to-replace-your-old-windows-10-pc-134500000.html">buy a new PC</a> that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook).</p></li>
<li><p>Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The third option is easier than it sounds — and can now be done for free in many cases — so we'll focus on that one here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-sign-up-for-windows-10-extended-security-updates-on-your-computer">How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer</h2>
<p>We can <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-pressured-to-extend-free-windows-10-security-updates-in-most-of-europe-164533056.html">question Microsoft's motives</a> for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely.</p>
<p>At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-1-make-sure-your-pc-is-up-to-date"><strong>Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date</strong></h3>
<p>You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings &gt; System &gt; About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-2-make-sure-youre-using-an-administrator-account"><strong>Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account</strong></h3>
<p>If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see "Administrator" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings &gt; Your Info.)</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-3-verify-if-your-pc-is-eligible-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-or-not"><strong>Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not)</strong></h3>
<p>If you see an option to upgrade to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html">Windows 11</a>, just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-4-enroll-in-extended-security-updates"><strong>Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates</strong></h3>
<p>Sign up for ESU by selecting Update &amp; Security from the Settings menu. Click the "Enroll Now" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it).</p>

(Screenshot/Engadget)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not seeing the "Enroll now" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above).</p>

(Screenshots/Engadget)</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="jump-link-step-5-choose-your-upgrade-method"><strong>Step 5: Choose your upgrade method</strong></h3>
<p>Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to use your administrator account to get started.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDjeKN1_Es"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e52590d0-a60f-11f0-96ff-415266e25201" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e52590d0-a60f-11f0-96ff-415266e25201" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" data-uuid="ab17ee67-0c79-3a86-b04a-7ee38e44c5dc"><figcaption>Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube)</figcaption></figure></a>
<p>That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-pressured-to-extend-free-windows-10-security-updates-in-most-of-europe-164533056.html">no strings attached</a>.) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this "free" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe.</p>
<p>The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=973badc7-4f72-4f95-82dc-34d0ba6aff68&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=5+GB+of+storage&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL21pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUvb25lZHJpdmUvZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTczYmFkYzctNGY3Mi00Zjk1LTgyZGMtMzRkMGJhNmFmZjY4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL21pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUvb25lZHJpdmUvZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb76BKdsZUEVk6dLEl2FB2BKQaUjjCPoN1dC7mQw4-c5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fonedrive%2Ffree-online-cloud-storage" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/free-online-cloud-storage">5 GB of storage</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Five years after the release of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-fan-edition-extended-hands-on-143012969.html"><ins>Galaxy S20 FE</ins></a>, Samsung has settled into a predictable pattern with its "Fan Edition" line of phones. Each new phone doesn't offer much new or different from its immediate predecessor, with the company opting to offer iterative updates instead.</p> 
<p>That might have been fine before, but with the arrival of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html"><ins>Nothing Phone 3a Pro</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html"><ins>Pixel 10</ins></a> — devices that changed the value proposition in their respective categories — the S25 FE feels woefully out of touch with a market that's changing to meet people's demands. There's not much here that makes the new Galaxy S25 FE stand out, and any "upgrades" aren't substantive.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>When I first took the S25 FE out of the box, I thought Samsung had played a cruel trick on me. The phone looks identical to its predecessor, sporting the same brushed aluminum frame that's been the company's go-to for years now. I had to dig the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-review-a-great-phone-but-i-wish-it-was-cheaper-190032655.html">S24 FE</a> out of my gadgets drawer to compare the two phones before I confirmed they were in fact different devices.</p> 
<p>The physical differences are minor. Samsung has tweaked the dimensions of the new phone, making it slightly shorter, wider and thinner. Specifically, the S25 FE measures in at 6.35 x 3.02 x 0.29 inches, while its predecessor was 6.38 x 3.04 x 0.31 inches. The new phone is also protected by Samsung's "enhanced Armor" aluminum frame.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More noticeable is that the S25 FE is lighter than last year's model, coming in at 6.7 ounces, down from 7.51 ounces. This is despite the fact the new device has a higher-capacity 4,900mAh battery. Together, these changes don't make the S25 FE easier to hold if you have small hands (just ask my girlfriend), but it does feel better balanced than its predecessor. One issue with the size of the S25 FE is the placement of the in-display fingerprint sensor. It's right at the bottom of the screen. I found this made it awkward to unlock the phone with my thumb — and I'm someone with big hands.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="14cc8ec8-fd73-4b16-9c1f-abf9910b60a2" /> 
<p>Another slight difference is the finish on the back of the phone. This time around, Samsung has gone with a matte coating, instead of the glossy finish it used on the S24 FE. It's a welcome change since it makes the new model less prone to smudging and attracting fingerprints. I just wish Samsung had decided to offer the S25 FE in more fun colors. At release, it's available in four colorways: white, icy blue, jet black and navy (pictured). So, if you don't like blue, I'm sorry.</p> 
<p>Amid the slight design tweaks, Samsung has gone with the same screen it did last year. The S25 FE has a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, with a panel that offers a 120Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution. The S24 FE's vibrant screen was one of the best parts of last year's model, and it's the same with S25 FE. It's easy to see the screen in bright sunlight, thanks to the fact it can push 1,900 nits of peak brightness. It's also vibrant, and with HDR10 support included, great for watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Samsung made a single tweak to the Galaxy S25 FE's camera hardware. Like last year's model, the new phone has a 50-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and a fast f/1.8 aperture lens. Once again, it also has an 8MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide angle that offers a 123-degree field of view.</p> 
<p>The one addition is a higher resolution 12MP front-facing camera with a faster f/2.2 aperture lens. For selfies, the S24 FE made do with a 10MP sensor and f/2.4 lens. If the new front-facing camera included phase detection autofocus (PDAF), it would be the same one that's available on the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-170040665.html"><ins>Galaxy S25</ins></a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't and that's a shame because PDAF greatly increases the likelihood your photos will come out sharp and in focus.</p> 
<p>It's also a shame Samsung decided not to update the FE's telephoto camera. Before the Nothing 3a Pro, that was one of the features that made the S24 FE stand out in its price range. In 2025, however, the S25 FE's telephoto feels outdated. It doesn't offer the 5x optical zoom of the Pixel 10 nor the 50MP of resolution and periscope zoom you get with the 3a Pro. Coming from the former, the FE's telephoto camera felt limiting. With only 8MP of resolution, trying to snap a photo at anything beyond 5x zoom was pointless; it would just turn out a blurry mess.</p> 
<p>As for FE's other cameras, they're decent if uninspiring. The 50MP camera is the best of the bunch, capable of capturing detailed, good-looking photos even in low light. The ultrawide, meanwhile, is mostly forgettable. It does an okay job of capturing big scenes, but it's lacking in dynamic range and detail. The selfie camera is a noticeable upgrade from the one that came with last year's model, and produces pleasing photos that are on par with what you can expect from the S25's front-facing camera.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, snapping pictures with the S25 FE feels like using a flagship phone from a few years ago. The one thing that saves it from being a complete blast from the past is the inclusion of Samsung's generative photo editing software, which you can use to remove distracting objects from photos. Of the AI photo apps I've tested, Samsung's is among the best at editing out objects without smearing the background. You can also use the generative edit to add things to a photo, but as you might expect, this doesn't work as well as removing them.</p>

<p>On paper, the S25 FE should offer better performance than its predecessor, thanks to Samsung's decision to equip the phone with its Exynos 2400 chipset over the cut-down Exynos 2400e it used on last year's model. In practice the two are about on par with one another. On Geekbench's processor test, the Exynos 2400 delivered a 2,144 single-core score and a 7,059 multi-core score. That's not much better than the 2,140 and 6,690 I recorded last fall on the S24 FE.</p> 
<p>Still, it's a more impressive showing than either the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html"><ins>Pixel 9a</ins></a> and Nothing 3a Pro had when my colleague Sam Rutherford and I put their Tensor G4 and Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chips through Geekbench earlier this year. For comparison, the former delivered a modest 1,665 on single-core performance and 4,294 on multi-core performance. The latter scored an even less impressive 1,115 and 3,082 respectively.</p> 
<p>In real-world use, the Exynos 2400 feels snappy. Scrolling is fast and fluid, as is opening apps and switching between them. Gaming performance is also impressive, with the chip able to handle the 60 fps modes in graphically demanding games like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-immortal-review-120001807.html"><em><ins>Diablo Immortal</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/"><em><ins>League of Legends: Wild Rift</ins></em></a> without dropping frames.</p> 
<p>Last year, Samsung said it redesigned the S24 FE's vapor chamber to make it bigger and improve cooling. With the S25 FE, that component is an additional 10 percent larger. However, if the new vapor chamber made a difference to the phone's thermals, I had a hard time telling. Both the S25 FE and S24 FE got warm after about 15 to 20 minutes of gaming. The new phone never got hot to the point I couldn't hold it anymore, but it also didn't feel noticeably cooler than the S24 FE running the same games.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As mentioned at the top, the S25 FE has a larger 4,900mAh battery. That's about four percent more capacity than the S24 FE offered. As a result, any difference in battery life is minimal. I'm sure there are some scenarios the S25 FE may last longer than its predecessor, but in my testing the two phones were equal in terms of longevity. With three to four hours of active screentime, I managed to get a full day of battery life from the S25 FE, with enough power left over to get the phone through the night before charging it in the morning. That's similar to the experience I had last year.</p> 
<p>Speaking of charging, the S24 FE, with a 25 watt wired limit, was painfully slow at it. Going into this review, my hope was the S25 FE would do better and I had good reason to be hopeful. Samsung lists the new phone as capable of charging at 45 watts. However, in my testing the S25 FE was only slightly faster than its predecessor. Plugged into a 130 watt Razer GaN charger, it took the phone about an hour and 14 minutes to charge to full from a battery at 10 percent life. When I replicated that same test with a 25 watt charger, it took the S25 FE just over an hour-and-a-half to charge back up.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Either way, if battery life is important to you, the Nothing 3a Pro and Pixel 9a are better bets. Both come with bigger batteries (5,000 and 5,100mAh, respectively), and with the former, you also get 50 watt charging.</p>

<p>The S25 FE ships with Android 16 and Samsung's One UI 8 out of the box. Samsung has promised to support the phone with at least seven generations of platform updates, so it should stay current with Google's yearly release schedule up until at least Android 23 in 2032. Notably, this means the S25 FE may end up on a more recent version of Android than the S25, S25 Edge and S25 Ultra, all of which released with Android 15.</p> 
<p>With One UI 8, the S25 FE has access to all of the latest AI features from both Samsung and Google. Some of these tools are useful; others replicate functionality that has been present in Android for a long time. For example, Google's Circle to Search is great. It makes it easy to do a visual search of anything on the phone's screen. On the other hand, I could do without Samsung's Now Brief, which offers much of the same utility you'll find on Android's Discover page (a feature that comes standard on every Android phone).</p> 
<p>Each S25 FE also comes with six months of free access to Google AI Pro. Normally priced at $20 per month, the service gives you access to some of the company's best models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, inside of the Gemini app. Within Flow, Google's AI filmmaking app, you also get limited access to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-31-is-better-at-generating-videos-from-images-220829129.html"><ins>Veo 3.1</ins></a>, Google's latest video generation system. Some other perks include 2TB of cloud storage and higher rate limits when using NotebookLM.</p>

<p>With changes that amount to window dressing, I can't recommend anyone buy the S25 FE at full price. There's just enough here to justify spending $650 on a phone that is barely an upgrade over its predecessor. If you're a Samsung fan, I'm sure the S25 FE will be frequently discounted, but why reward the company for a lazy effort? Besides, the S25, following a <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-200-off-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-for-prime-day-100037363.html"><ins>$200 discount for Prime Day</ins></a>, was only $10 more than the FE earlier this month.</p> 
<p>Over the past few years, Google and Nothing have shown midrange phones don't need to be boring, iterative affairs. For Samsung, I think it's time to rethink its FE strategy. If these phones offered something different — say actual fan favorite features like a headphone jack — there could be compelling reasons to recommend them. But as things stand, there's just no reason to buy a new FE phone when the company's flagships see steep price discounts within months of their release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of February, Anthropic <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html">announced Claude Code</a>. In the eight months since then, the coding agent has arguably become the company&#39;s most important product, helping it carve out a niche for itself in the highly competitive AI market. Now, Anthropic is making it easier for developers to use Claude Code in more places with a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!FY8Yx9u0w-2ZTY5kVXnLhRUnDV9G4vi8qwlBBVss1ry8HTqJfks973x-8W-9QYYY0KeSAhrb35mDlHweRlsr$">new web interface</a> for accessing the agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get started, you&#39;ll need connect Claude to your GitHub repositories. From there, the process of using the agent is the same as if it had direct terminal access. Describe what you need from it, and the agent will take it from there. Claude will provide progress updates while it works, and you can even steer it in real-time with additional prompts. Through the web interface, it&#39;s also possible to assign Claude multiple coding tasks to run in parallel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Every Claude Code task runs in an isolated sandbox environment with network and filesystem restrictions. Git interactions are handled through a secure proxy service that ensures Claude can only access authorized repositories — helping keep your code and credentials protected throughout the entire workflow,&quot; said Anthropic.</p>
<p>In addition to making Claude Code available on the web, Anthropic is releasing a preview of the agent inside of its iOS app. The company warns the integration is early, and that it hopes &quot;to quickly refine the mobile experience based on your feedback.&quot;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-the-sims-find-a-new-home-on-ios-and-android.html"><em><ins>The Sims Mobile</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is going away as EA will shut it down on January 20, nearly eight years after its debut in March 2018. An update that went live on Monday is the final one and the company is delisting the game on October 21. Since the game requires online servers (game progress is stored there), it&#39;ll no longer be possible to play <em>The Sims Mobile </em>in three months&#39; time.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The Sims Mobile </em>and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination,&quot; EA said <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a>. &quot;You’ve amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We’re proud to have shared this journey with you, and as a token of our appreciation, we’ve prepared a few surprises as we head into <em>TSM</em>’s final chapter.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>EA will run 14 events, including limited-time quests and treasure hunts, in <em>The Sims Mobile</em> over the next few months. It&#39;s no longer possible to spend any real money in the game, though players can use their existing in-game currency. As of today, players also have unlimited energy, which &quot;should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play,&quot; EA said. On January 6, EA will unlock all of the Build Mode and Create A Sim items so players can fully customize their homes and sims&#39; looks for a couple of weeks before the grim reaper shows up for <em>The Sims Mobile.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2022, EA and Sims studio Maxis <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-sims-5-cross-platform-project-rene-ea-maxis-mobile-freeplay-185822870.html"><ins>announced Project Rene</ins></a>, a game that will run across multiple platforms, including mobile. So it&#39;s maybe not too surprising that the company wants to focus its Sims mobile efforts there.</p>
<p>In any case, the shutdown stinks, especially for those who have spent money on <em>The Sims Mobile</em> as well as for the sake of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html"><ins>game preservation</ins></a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s a lot to like about NordVPN, as I covered in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN review</a>. It&#39;s one of the fastest among the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a>, and it&#39;s got a bunch of cool, specialized servers for various VPN tasks. But the apps can be frustrating, and beyond that, no VPN is perfect for everyone. If you&#39;ve decided NordVPN isn&#39;t for you, here&#39;s how to cancel your subscription and get your money back.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-off-auto-renewal-on-nordvpn"><strong>How to turn off auto-renewal on NordVPN</strong></h2>
<p>Even though you&#39;ve decided to part ways with NordVPN, you may want to keep your subscription active while you pick out a replacement service. If that&#39;s the case, you can simply cancel automatic renewal and let your subscription expire at the end of the billing period. If you change your mind before then, you can turn auto-renew back on. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ol>
<li><p>Go to my.nordaccount.com. Click <strong>Log in to Nord Account </strong>and enter your email address and password.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll arrive at the account overview page. In the left-hand column, click on <strong>Billing</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the list of subscriptions that appears, find NordVPN. Find the line that says &quot;Auto-renewal: ON,&quot; and click the <strong>Cancel </strong>link next to it.</p></li>
<li><p>A warning message will appear. Click <strong>Cancel auto-renewal </strong>at the bottom-right.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This will turn auto-renewal off. If you decide to turn it back on, just go back to the billing tab of your Nord account overview, find your NordVPN subscription and click <strong>Enable auto-renewal</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-if-you-subscribed-through-an-app-store"><strong>How to cancel if you subscribed through an app store</strong></h3>
<p>If you paid for NordVPN on a mobile device through Google Play or the Apple app store, you&#39;ll need to go to the relevant app store to cancel the subscription. On Android, sign in to Google Play, touch your profile picture, tap <strong>Payments &amp; subscriptions </strong>and tap <strong>Subscriptions.</strong> Scroll until you find NordVPN, tap it and hit <strong>Cancel subscription.</strong> If you want a refund, follow the instructions in &quot;How to get a refund from NordVPN&quot; below.</p>
<p>On iOS, open the settings app, touch your profile picture, then tap <strong>Subscription.</strong> Scroll down to NordVPN, tap it and hit <strong>Cancel subscription</strong>. To get a refund for an Apple purchase, contact the Apple support team instead of the NordVPN team.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-delete-your-nordvpn-account"><strong>How to delete your NordVPN account</strong></h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re sick of NordVPN and already have another VPN lined up, you can cancel immediately by deleting your Nord account altogether. This will also cut you off from any other Nord Security products you might be using, including NordPass and NordLocker.</p>

<li><p>Go to my.nordaccount.com, click <strong>Log in to Nord Account</strong> and enter your credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>At the top-right of the account overview page, click your email address. In the dropdown menu, click <strong>Account settings</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the bottom of the page to find the account deletion controls. Click <strong>Delete account.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Nord will send an authentication code to your account&#39;s email address. Enter it.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the onscreen prompts to confirm deletion.</p></li>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-nordvpn"><strong>How to get a refund from NordVPN</strong></h2>
<p>NordVPN has a standard 30-day money-back guarantee. As long as you bought your subscription in the last 30 days, you can get a full refund. To do so, you&#39;ll need to first cancel auto-renewal on your plan as described above, then contact support to ask for the refund.</p>
<p>You can reach NordVPN support by going to the help center at support.nordvpn.com. To reach the live chat and email ticket options, you&#39;ll need to work your way down to a bottom-level help center article, then scroll down until you reach the section titled &quot;Still having issues?&quot; It&#39;s frustrating, but you can get there by just clicking the first link on every page (or just <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1ddb3ee-c532-422e-ab51-bd46ab294248&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=follow+this+link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxNjQwOTY5Nzg0NDktSS1jYW4tdC1jb25uZWN0LXRvLWEtTm9yZFZQTi1zZXJ2ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImYxZGRiM2VlLWM1MzItNDIyZS1hYjUxLWJkNDZhYjI5NDI0OCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lm5vcmR2cG4uY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTY0MDk2OTc4NDQ5LUktY2FuLXQtY29ubmVjdC10by1hLU5vcmRWUE4tc2VydmVyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQN3YqZSQHtryrjeV1LjDaSWOo-zVTenL1v_t1Mu5LTq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.nordvpn.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F20164096978449-I-can-t-connect-to-a-NordVPN-server" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20164096978449-I-can-t-connect-to-a-NordVPN-server">follow this link</a> and scroll down).</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve found the buttons, either start a live chat or open the email form. Whichever you choose, explain that you&#39;ve cancelled your subscription and would like a refund. Make sure not to end the interaction until you&#39;ve received confirmation that your refund will be processed. Afterwards, it&#39;ll take up to 10 business days for your reimbursement to go through.</p>

<p>To that end, there are now three main and easily identifiable tabs. The &quot;Today&quot; tab includes only the most relevant data to help inform daily decisions. The &quot;Vitals&quot; tab offers &quot;at-a-glance views of core health pillars.&quot; This includes data on sleep, stress and cardiovascular trends. Colors change based on various biometric indicators to offer quick visual cues.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The &quot;My Health&quot; tab is more interested in long-term health, offering cumulative data on a user&#39;s strengths, traits and opportunities for proactive care. This tab also includes a section about habits and routines to link &quot;daily behaviors to measurable outcomes.&quot;</p>
<p>The new Oura app also offers some increased health-tracking capabilities. The previous version of the app included a view that showed a month of data regarding menstrual cycles and fertility window predictions. This has been increased to a full year. Members also now get personalized cycle phase data from a single night of sleep instead of having to wait two months like before.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify just introduced a feature that lets users <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-10-20/live-music-venues-on-spotify/"><ins>follow their favorite concert venues</ins></a>. This will provide people with updates and details about upcoming concerts.</p>
<p>Once a venue is selected as a favorite, it gets saved in a user&#39;s library. Browsing each venue provides information on scheduled concerts, general announcements and other stuff. Folks can even filter upcoming shows by genre. Clicking on a specific spot will also pull up &quot;tailored suggestions for other venues&quot; in the vicinity.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify&#39;s new venue-tracking platform will offer links to each location&#39;s &quot;official ticketing partner&quot; to make it easier to scoop up some tickets. The company says it currently tracks over 20,000 venues throughout the globe, from &quot;iconic arenas to beloved independent clubs.&quot;</p>
<p>Spotify also announced a change to its live event feed. This will now update daily instead of weekly. For the uninitiated, this tool <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-live-events-feed-125033086.html"><ins>tracks when artists are touring</ins></a> and lists nearby live events.</p>
<p>The platform recently added yet another tool for concert discovery in the form of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-latest-custom-playlist-highlights-artists-with-upcoming-shows-in-your-area-150817219.html"><ins>custom playlists that highlight artists</ins></a> with upcoming shows in the area. These playlists update every week and include 30 songs.</p>
<p>These are welcome tools, as artists <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/30/spotify-smaller-artists-wrapped-indie-musicians"><ins>don&#39;t get paid a whole lot</ins></a> from streaming platforms, instead relying on live ticket sales. The features could also help stem some of the bad press that&#39;s been coming Spotify&#39;s way lately, thanks to CEO Daniel Ek&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave"><ins>involvement with a weapons manufacturing company</ins></a> and the platform going running recruitment ads for <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-ads-all-over-streaming-services-spotify-hbo-pandora-1235447970/"><ins>controversial government entities like ICE</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-now-lets-people-follow-venues-to-find-out-about-concerts-153836816.html?src=rss]]></description>

So if you've already been feeling that your current aging PC is on the verge of dying — slow performance, whining fans, batteries that barely keep a charge — it's probably time to consider replacing it with a new system.</p>

It looks and feels luxurious, and it has one of the best screens around. You may just need some time getting used to its invisible trackpad (which is blended into the palm rest), and its capacitive function key row.

<h3 id="0d164e1d-b271-4001-abce-4aa8ee5d08bc">ASUS ZenBook S 14</h3>
<p>The ZenBook S14 wowed us with its powerful hardware, excellent battery life (of over 16 hours) and solid construction. It's a sign of how far ASUS has come from simply copying Apple. The S14 is also lighter than the MacBook Air, and it includes more useful ports (two USB-C, one USB-A, HDMI and a headphone jack). Its Ceraluminum case (a unique ceramic material) also feels surprisingly polished, and its OLED screen looks simply amazing.

<h3 id="d8157101-c187-46ba-968c-277e34fef1da">Apple MacBook Air&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Don't yell at me — Apple's new computers are so good that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">Windows users should seriously consider jumping ship to Macs</a>. While the software may take some getting used to, it's worth the struggle for the speed and incredible battery life from Apple's M-series chips. The MacBook Air remains one of the best computers around, with an incredibly thin and fan-less case and far more power than you'd think. And if you're an iPhone user, you'll also have access to features like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-sequoia-review-iphone-mirroring-is-more-useful-than-you-think-140008463.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">phone mirroring</a> that are tough to replicate on Windows.

While we haven't reviewed this specific model, the specs on even the entry-level configuration have all of the power you need for basic computing, despite housing everything in a frame that's notably smaller than older tower PCs. And if you need a bit more performance, consider the slightly more expensive Dell Pro, which can squeeze in up to 32GB of RAM and a handful of dedicated graphics cards.</p>

<h3 id="038394bd-681b-4cb1-97a2-8ce095d3135f">Apple Mac Mini</h3>
<p>Apple's Mac mini is one of the most powerful mini-desktops around, it's adorably small and it starts at just $599 (look for the frequent sales that drop the price by as much as $100). Just as I argued above for the MacBook Air, it's worth considering the jump to MacOS simply because Apple's hardware is so impressive now. And don't worry, you can connect any monitor to it, and you won't have to replace your existing PC keyboard and mouse.</p>

<h2 id="c964b1cc-2cac-4ca2-80a7-51396bee2da4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="a5190240-9e05-4b93-85b2-2a09ad105aab">Do I need to upgrade to a new computer if my current Windows 10 PC still works fine for me?</h3>
<p>Your computer will still continue to run following the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">Microsoft’s termination of default support for Windows 10 on October 15, 2025</a>, but that’s not a wise longterm strategy. The free Extended Security Updates will buy you another year, but that's effectively a limited life support: After that, Windows 10 PCs won’t receive security updates or any sort of improvements, so they’ll be vulnerable to hacking and malware. And if you’ve still got an old Windows 10 machine, there’s a good chance that its components may wear out soon. If you choose to continue using a Windows 10 PC, be sure to back up your important data and try not to rely on it for critical tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="b47244d8-0b05-4ee6-9caf-581b7d54cf36">Can a Mac run native Windows software?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Virtualization software like VMWare and Parallels can let you run Windows apps inside of macOS, but be aware that also involves buying a copy of Windows and dedicating a large chunk of disk space for it. These days, most major apps are available across both platforms, so be sure to check if there’s a Mac version of your favorite Windows app.</p>
<h3 id="61f3555d-78ca-4696-b011-753f90be0af9">Can a Chromebook or iPad replace a Windows 10 PC?</h3>
<p>Chromebooks and iPads both have very specific purposes: Chromebooks are great budget-friendly machines for accessing the web and running online apps. iPads are a handy way to upgrade your mobile internet experiences, since their large screens are better for browsing the web, running apps and watching media. But neither are ideal replacements for a Windows 10 PC, which can access the full breadth of Windows software in addition to the web. If either one works for you, great; but we think the options listed above are better full-service PC replacements.</p>
<h3 id="7887eefa-99f8-421d-a81f-3125d1d90438">I have a ton of PC games. What's my best upgrade option?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to find a decent gaming desktop from a reliable computer maker these days, just make sure you’re equipped with at least 32GB of RAM (new titles can be pretty memory intensive), and an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/how-to-buy-a-gpu-160100017.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">NVIDIA RTX 40-series or AMD Radeon RX 9000-series GPU</a>.</p>
<p>As for CPUs, I’d recommend sticking with Intel’s 13th-gen chips or AMD’s Ryzen 8000-series processors at a minimum. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">Don’t count out gaming laptops</a> either, as they’ve come a long way over the last decade. It’s not hard to find a gaming notebook that’s powerful, portable and useful for multimedia and productivity work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update, October 20 2025, 9:30AM ET: </strong><em>This story has been updated to reflect that the Windows 10 end of support date has now passed, and we’ve included a link to an explainer on how to extend support for another year for free.</em></p>
