The model is an electric pick-up truck, and the best-selling one in the US, but the publication cited Ford execs who said the company would consider halting production completely on the F-150 Lightning. We’ve reached out to Ford for comment and will update if we receive a statement.</p><p>The auto brand said it would cut back on production <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-is-cutting-f-150-lightning-production-due-to-waning-demand-173838340.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">last January</a> due to slowing demand for the vehicles. At the time, Ford shuffled several of the workers who had been building the F-150 Lightning to constructing other auto models. Then, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/23/ford-halts-f-150-lightning-production-focus-on-gas-and-hybrids/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a fire</a> this October at an aluminum plant supplying Ford led the company to pause production of the Lightning trucks.

Rather than projects such as the F-150 Lightning, Ford has hinted that it will shift strategy to work on smaller, more affordable electric vehicles based on its Universal EV platform.</p><p>Ford may not be the only manufacturer to ramp down its EV plans in the US.

Rockstar Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that <em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>has been delayed once again to November 19, 2026. The open world game was previously delayed from its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-arrive-in-fall-2025-205513138.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2025 launch</a> window to May 26, 2026 <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">earlier this year.</a><br><br>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar said on its official X account. The new launch date delays the hotly anticipated game by a whole six months from its previous date.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi everyone,<br><br>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.<br><br>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>Take-Two, <em>GTA VI</em>’s publisher, does not appear particularly worried about the delay. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">an interview with <em>The Game Business</em></a><em>. </em>“We feel really good about this release date. It’s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we’re really supportive of Rockstar’s approach.”</p><p><em>GTA V</em> was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-31-grand-theft-auto-5-release-date-september-17.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">originally released</a> in 2013, and has been rereleased multiple times in the years that followed for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-12-grand-theft-auto-ps4-xbox-one-pc.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">two generations</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-v-ps5-xbox-series-x-release-date-142203171.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">of consoles</a>. The games remains incredibly popular, which is part of the reason Take-Two seems so certain about the sequel. It helps that <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>, a multiplayer mode for <em>GTA V </em>that can also be downloaded as a standalone game, is itself a hit. “We continue to supply content to <em>GTA Online</em>, and in fact we’ve had terrific results there. And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it’s had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And <em>GTA V </em>has sold in more than 220 million units,” Zelnick said.<br><br>The long wait for a new GTA hasn’t been without controversy. The game <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/rockstar-confirms-gta-vi-leak-143918535.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">leaked extensively</a> in 2022, revealing that it would feature a female protagonist, a fact that was later confirmed in the first official trailer. And while Rockstar Games has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">reportedly attempted</a> to improve its company culture since <em>GTA V</em> came out, the developer is currently being accused of union busting in the UK.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It doesn't look like Disney-owned channels including ABC and ESPN will be returning to YouTube TV anytime soon. The Walt Disney Co. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html">pulled its channels from YouTube TV</a> as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement and the spat is showing no signs of a resolution yet. While big sporting events are often where the rubber meets the road on these channel blackouts, YouTube TV subscribers were unable to see any college football games on ABC or ESPN all weekend, and it's looking like this weekend will be just as frustrating for sports fans.</p> 
<p>YouTube TV had previously stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. YouTube has<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/streaming/articles/seeing-60-credit-hidden-youtube-164348226.html"> confirmed</a> this credit hasn't been activated yet for customers, but if and when it is, the discount provides little consolation if you want to watch this weekend's college games or your favorite shows like <em>Abbott Elementary</em>, <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> and <em>Dancing with the Stars </em>the night they air.<em>&nbsp;</em>If you do want to watch any live shows or sports this week, you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>One of the cheapest ways to watch ESPN is with a Sling Day Pass — for just $5/day, you can tune into any and all ESPN programming with no other commitments. If you want a full switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all the Disney-owned channels. (Remember, unlike a lot of cable plans, you can easily <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-or-pause-your-youtube-tv-subscription-192023656.html">pause or cancel YouTube TV</a> or any of these alternatives, so long as you have month-to-month subscriptions.) Below, we've outlined some of your best options to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, all pulled from our list of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html">best live TV streaming services to cut cable</a>, as well as a comprehensive list of which channels have been affected, and the biggest sporting events of the week that <em>won't</em> be available to YouTube TV subscribers.</p>

That is an option if you're looking for just some of the ESPN channels (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sling TV;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d1c9a21f-4263-4b41-b619-0f75ee410a45&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;linkText=Sling+Orange&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGluZy5jb20vc2VydmljZS9zbGluZy1vcmFuZ2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxYzlhMjFmLTQyNjMtNGI0MS1iNjE5LTBmNzVlZTQxMGE0NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL3NlcnZpY2Uvc2xpbmctb3JhbmdlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbQNsyHVoqqGrCK2uUWWsoTmJixhbsecRFvs0n76GM7o&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fservice%2Fsling-orange" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.sling.com/service/sling-orange">Sling Orange</a> tier), but ABC isn't included. (If you're just looking to catch one of this week's big games, like <em>Monday Night Football</em> on ESPN, it's a great short-term solution.) If you want a longer-term solution, you can get both ESPN and ABC with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that&#39;s long irked me about Meta&#39;s smart glasses is how often you have to say &quot;hey Meta.&quot; Even though the company&#39;s AI assistant has gotten significantly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">more capable</a>, there&#39;s something a little cringey about using its voice commands in public spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the company has rolled out an update that makes you a little less dependent on voice commands for all its glasses. A new &quot;quick connect&quot; feature allows you to create a one-touch shortcut for &quot;frequently used communication actions,&quot; like making a phone call or sending a text to a specific contact. The update is out now as part of the 19.2 software update.</p><p>The idea of &quot;quick connect&quot; is similar to the functionality of the &quot;action button&quot; on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> glasses, though it&#39;s more limited in scope. The feature allows you to designate a specific contact that you can message, text or call just by holding down on the touchpad on the right side of the glasses. The Meta AI app will even let you choose your preferred method of reaching them, whether it&#39;s WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger or your phone&#39;s native calling or messaging app. The same one-touch press and hold shortcut can also be used to send photos and videos shot on the glasses right after you take them (also via your chosen app).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-06_at_13.02.45.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-11-06_at_13.02.45.png" style="height:1896px;width:1179px;" alt="You can designate a specific contact and on which app you want to be able to contact them." data-uuid="2269632a-7bdb-4f8d-938f-c0b27c7ebd81"><figcaption>You can designate a specific contact and on which app you want to be able to contact them.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>During its Connect event, Meta previewed some updates for third-party apps that appear to allow developers to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">set their own</a> wake words for the glasses when using their services. So there is some hope that eventually the company will offer a bit more flexibility with its voice commands. Even so, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be able to get away with never having to say &quot;hey Meta,&quot; but the quick connect update is a handy way to make messaging a bit more discreet. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-smart-glasses-have-a-new-shortcut-to-call-and-text-without-saying-hey-meta-213303178.html?src=rss]]></description>

The game, which originally released on PC and PlayStation 4 (and Nintendo 3DS in Japan), is the epitome of &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.&quot; Instead of using new, experimental combat systems, &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot; relies on classic turn-based battles and focuses most of its attention on telling a gripping story with memorable characters. The game doesn&#39;t do anything new, at least on the gameplay front, but what it does stands heads and shoulders above its rivals.</p><p dir="ltr">When it was time to port the game to the Nintendo Switch, Square Enix created &quot;<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-switch/">Dragon Quest XI S</a>,&quot; which is arguably the superior package. Graphics took a slight hit, but the new features more than make up for it. This port features an orchestral soundtrack — the original relied on MIDI music — cosmetics, and a photo mode. But that&#39;s not all. &quot;Dragon Quest XI S&quot; also boasts quite a few quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to use the forge anywhere and to automatically acquire resources without having to pick them up off the ground. &quot;Dragon Quest XI S&quot; provides so many improvements that it became the de facto &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; and replaced the original game on all platforms. But, the Switch version still reigns supreme since it is the only one to offer <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-free-demo-promises-10-hours-of-gameplay-04645692/">a 10-hour demo</a>. If you can&#39;t stand the game for 10 hours, why bother <a href="https://www.svg.com/168016/how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-dragon-quest-11-on-switch/">playing for 125</a>?</p>]]></media:description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is making billions of dollars every year from ads marketing scams and illegal products on its platform, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/meta-is-earning-fortune-deluge-fraudulent-ads-documents-show-2025-11-06/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a new report</a> from <em>Reuters. </em>The report details the staggering numbers behind scam ads on Meta&#39;s platform, and raises fresh questions about why the company has failed to get the problem in check.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, Meta estimated that scam ads could account for as much as 10 percent of its revenue, a total that would amount to about $16 billion, according to documents reported by <em>Reuters. </em>This includes ads for &quot;fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos, and the sale of banned medical products.&quot; In fact, scams on Meta&#39;s platform are so far-reaching that researchers at the company estimated that its apps &quot;were involved in a third of all successful scams in the U.S.&quot;</p><p>The report also outlines how Meta has at times made it harder for its own teams to fight such ads, and how its own processes allow for repeat offenders to continue buying ads. It says that a &quot;small advertiser&quot; caught &quot;promoting financial fraud&quot; wouldn&#39;t be blocked until they were flagged &quot;at least eight times.&quot; Meta has been even more lenient with &quot;bigger spenders,&quot; which have reportedly been permitted to &quot;accrue more than 500 strikes&quot; without being removed from the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>That may sound shockingly permissive, particularly compared to Meta&#39;s standards for users on its platform, but the <em>Reuters</em> report highlights how high the stakes are for Meta. The report notes that just four ad campaigns removed by Meta this year accounted for $67 million in revenue for the company. The report says that internally, executives have grappled with how to bring scam ads under control without adversely affecting the company&#39;s bottom line. At one point, managers were reportedly told not to &quot;take actions that could cost Meta more than 0.15% of the company’s total revenue.&quot;</p><p>In response to the report, Meta told <em>Reuters</em> that the estimated 10 percent of revenue from scam ads was &quot;rough and overly-inclusive,” but didn&#39;t share an alternative figure. &quot;Over the past 18 months, we have reduced user reports of scam ads globally by 58 percent and, so far in 2025, we’ve removed more than 134 million pieces of scam ad content,” spokesperson Andy Stone said.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-making-billions-of-dollars-from-scam-ads-on-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-report-says-184128645.html?src=rss]]></description>

Thanks to its latest Gemini models, the company says NotebookLM now has a four times larger context window than before and six times longer conversation memory. Overall, chat quality should be about 50 percent better too.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon just introduced an AI tool that will <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/books-and-authors/amazon-kindle-translate-books-authors"><ins>automatically translate books into other languages</ins></a>. The appropriately-named Kindle Translate is being advertised as a resource for authors that self publish on the platform.</p>
<p>The company says the tool can translate entire books between English and Spanish and German to English. Amazon promises that more languages are coming down the pike. It&#39;s available right now in a beta form to select authors enrolled in the Kindle Direct Publishing platform. There&#39;s a broader rollout planned for a later date.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Books that use this service will have a clear Kindle Translate label, which might serve as a warning to consumers. Translating a book isn&#39;t a matter of just swapping out words. There&#39;s a whole lot of nuance and intent behind those words and it&#39;s unclear if the algorithm will be able to handle all of that. Major literary works often take years to get a decent translation out the door. Just ask Americans who often have to wait eons to gobble up the latest book by someone like Haruki Murakami.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXimPIY6qI0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Devolver Digital had a lovely little surprise up its sleeve this fine Thursday. The publisher released an animated short for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Ball x Pit</em></a>, the roguelite mashup sensation that’s put a serious dent in the productivity levels of several of the Engadget crew. The funny four-minute clip, which comedy animation house Mashed created, clears up some key questions about the game. </p><p>To set things up, <em>Ball x Pit </em>is set after a cataclysmic event wipes out the city of Ballbylon. A pit is all that really remains, and hunters descend into it to find treasure and resources to build New Ballbylon. In the pit, you fire an array of balls (a bit like in <em>Breakout</em>) to destroy enemies that move incessantly toward you (like in <em>Space Invaders</em>). There are bosses and characters with special abilities and powerups you can merge and evolve to devastating effect. There’s a base-building side to the game too that sees you bouncing the hunters around New Ballbylon to obtain resources and build structures. It’s a very good video game.</p><p>The short features two residents of the town joking about some of these hunters during a celebration called Hero Day. The pair ribs the base character, The Warrior, for being a bit basic. When it comes to the second hero — the Itchy Finger — we find out just how the heroes fire the balls. Heads up: it’s a little gross. </p><p>One of the things I wished <em>Ball x Pit </em>had more of is lore, and I love that we get some of that here. This is a fun short that makes some lighthearted jabs at the game while describing some of its features and oh no I’m probably going to sucked back in to playing it again — even before developer Kenny Sun <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/city-of-balls-was-the-original-title-and-somehow-ball-x-pit-got-even-weirder-from-there" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">adds some extra stuff to it</a> at some point.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit </em>is out now on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. It’s available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-ball-x-pit-animated-short-answers-some-key-questions-about-our-roguelite-obsession-180528272.html?src=rss]]></description>

Evotrex &quot;exists to transform how people experience the outdoors,&quot; according to CEO Alex Xiao. On Thursday, the California-based company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.evotrex.com/pages/evotrex-exits-stealth" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> that it had secured $16 million in Pre-A funding.

The gas motor is there to recharge the battery and extend its range. They claim that the gas engine is more eco-friendly than others. They say it&#39;s quieter and more efficient, and that the RV trailer can use the motor&#39;s excess heat to warm the cabin.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/evo_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/evo_2.jpg" style="height:628px;width:1200px;" alt="Inside of the Evotrex RV cabin.

That&#39;s Black Friday, for those at home keeping score.</p>
<p>This is a fairly large set, with 3,600 pieces and all kinds of knick-knacks pulled from the show. It ships with nine minifigures, including Captain Picard, Guinan and Worf. Riker even comes with a trombone and Data accompanies his beloved cat, Spot. Every main character is here, even Wesley Crusher. Ensign Ro Laren makes an appearance, for those who want to recreate the crackling tension between her and Picard.</p>

<p>The ship itself is represented in all of its glory. The saucer section is detachable and there&#39;s a shuttle bay door that opens. Inside, there are two cute little shuttlepods. All told, the model measures around 10.5 inches tall, 23.5 inches long and 18.5 inches wide. It comes with a stand so it&#39;ll look great on that Trek-themed mantle.</p>
<p>The set will be available for preorder soon, but we don&#39;t have an actual date on that. It costs $400. Now that we finally have an official Lego Enterprise, where is the Lego Voyager and Lego Deep Space Nine? Get on that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/legos-star-trek-uss-enterprise-set-arrives-on-black-friday-173414532.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Announced to coincide with Stranger Things Day today (November 6, 1983, is the day Will Byers originally got kidnapped, in case you’re scratching your head), <em>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85</em> takes place between seasons 2 and 3 of the live-action show, during the winter of 1985. It stars what looks like the majority of the original characters — albeit not voiced by the actors who play them in the main show — as they face off against new monsters and a (yet another) &quot;paranormal mystery terrorizing their town.&quot; Hope you didn’t think that Hawkins was about to catch a break.</p>

<p><em>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85</em> stars Brooklyn Davey Norstedt as Eleven, Jolie Hoang-Rappaport as Max, Luca Diaz as Mike, Elisha &quot;EJ&quot; Williams as Lucas, Braxton Quinney as Dustin, Ben Plessala as Will and Brett Gipson as Hopper. It’s coming to Netflix next year, exact release date currently unspecified.</p>
<p>As for <em>Stranger Things </em>proper, that’s coming in just a few weeks time, with the first batch of episodes landing on November 26. More arrive on Christmas Day, with the finale hitting Netflix on December 31.

SpaceX had previously said it would use these licenses for its Starlink satellites as it works to build out the network&#39;s 5G connectivity.</p>
<p>The AWS-3 spectrum licenses changing hands include frequencies used in the US for commercial wireless services such as mobile and satellite communications.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first paid DLC for <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMve2vXAQGQ"><ins>arrives on December 10</ins></a>, which is a mere seven weeks after the game <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-legends-z-a-arrives-october-16-150835791.html"><ins>originally hit store shelves</ins></a>. <em>Mega Dimension</em> costs $30, which might <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><ins>pour more gasoline</ins></a> on the &quot;Nintendo charges too much&quot; fire. However, there&#39;s plenty of neat stuff coming with this update for Switch and Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, there&#39;s a sizable post-game story. The current title isn&#39;t completely devoid of post-game content, but doesn&#39;t have much by way of story. This will be a good way to get back in touch with the various denizens of Lumiose City. Speaking of, the trailer shows an iconic character or two returning from <em>Pokémon X </em>and<em> Y</em> who were missing from <em>Z-A</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="37a766a1bd51486b8b03c8c340ef960b"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMve2vXAQGQ?si=msjWisBVms0bVeV_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The story looks to involve travel to an alternate dimension of some kind, thanks to the legendary Pokémon Hoopa. This means that players will traverse a different version of Lumiose City, complete with plenty of new Pokémon to catch. These include creatures that aren&#39;t actually native to the region, including standouts like Baxcalibur and Corviknight.</p>
<p>Pokémon will also be able to beef up past level 100 in the DLC, giving players another reason to grind beyond shiny hunting. We don&#39;t know if the interdimensional Lumiose City will include new collectibles, like an updated batch of hidden Colorful Screws. I sure hope so. I love parkouring around the city.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the only DLC available for the game. Game Freak actually just dropped a little free update with a new sidequest. Use the game&#39;s Mystery Gift function to unlock it.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-135651443.html"><ins>is legitimately a fun game</ins></a>, despite what folks on the internet want you to think. They aren&#39;t completely in the wrong. It can be buggy. The graphics don&#39;t exactly scream &quot;AAA title in 2025&quot; and the tutorial section is pretty annoying. The city could use a bit more life and the map can be confusing. It&#39;s still super fun, even if Wild Zone 17 will likely haunt my dreams for years to come.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-legends-z-as-first-dlc-launches-on-december-10-162144665.html?src=rss]]></description>

Amazon has <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-plus-bmw-voice-assitant"><ins>announced</ins></a> the latest version of Alexa Custom Assistant, the platform that allows companies (including BMW) to build their own AI assistants that leverage Alexa tech, which will be powered by Alexa+ going forward.</p>
<p>With Alexa+ architecture working under the hood, drivers will benefit from a more natural, conversational style of in-vehicle interactions, while making use of the assistant’s more comprehensive agentic capabilities and ability to deal with more complex instructions than it could previously. Alexa+ can access more than 70 large language models (LLM), and Amazon has promised that any conversation you’ve had with one of its home devices can be continued in the car.</p>

<p>BMW has gone all in on Amazon’s ecosystem, with its connected features also powered by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. The new Alexa Custom Assistant will come to select BMW models soon, but we don&#39;t currently have any specifics as to the exact date or which vehicles will get it.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-coming-to-bmw-vehicles-161455252.html?src=rss]]></description>

What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week.

We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.<br><br>Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday tech deals</a> you can get right now, and we&#39;ll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November.

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-the-best-early-tech-deals-on-apple-shark-lego-and-other-gear-ahead-of-the-biggest-sale-of-the-year-100052620.html?src=rss]]></description>

</div><p></p><p>Mars missions typically launch during a narrow window of time when the red planet and the Earth are aligned. It’s a phenomenon that only happens once every two years. Colorado aerospace company Advanced Space designed Escapade’s trajectory for Mars missions that do <strong>not</strong> launch within that timeframe. The satellites will linger in the  L2 Lagrange point between the sun and the Earth for a year. In November 2026, they will do a slingshot around our planet in order to reach Mars sometime in 2027 during that once-in-every-two-year alignment. “Can we launch to Mars when the planets are not aligned? Escapade is paving the way for that,” said Jeffrey Parker of Advanced Space. </p><p>New Glenn will lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station’s Launch Complex 36. The company is aiming for a 2:45 PM Eastern time launch on November 9. As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://spacenews.com/second-new-glenn-launch-set-for-nov-9/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">SpaceNews</a> notes, the US government shutdown could limit NASA’s coverage, though the agency is still expected to livestream the event. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/blue-origins-second-new-glenn-launch-will-carry-real-nasa-satellites-153000627.html?src=rss]]></description>

The 25 percent discount applies to multiple colors, too.</p> 
<p>We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html">best MacBook computers</a>.

The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That&#39;s well beyond a full day of work.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it&#39;s technically just a 13-inch panel. There&#39;s support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.</p> 
<p>This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There&#39;s no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html">released the MacBook Pro M5</a>, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

Peloton made the original Bike+ between 2019 and 2022. <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4339ae4b-a89e-41c5-91e0-fd6f31c8933e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzExLzA2L3BlbG90b24tcmVjYWxscy04MzMwMDAtbW9yZS1iaWtlcy1vdmVyLXNlYXQtcG9zdC1pc3N1ZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MzM5YWU0Yi1hODllLTQxYzUtOTFlMC1mZDZmMzFjODkzM2UiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMDYvcGVsb3Rvbi1yZWNhbGxzLTgzMzAwMC1tb3JlLWJpa2VzLW92ZXItc2VhdC1wb3N0LWlzc3VlLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfpy2SsvG8RJ_Yx92HSa7qR6nkUZY17i_m3ASembAMXb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F11%2F06%2Fpeloton-recalls-833000-more-bikes-over-seat-post-issue.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/peloton-recalls-833000-more-bikes-over-seat-post-issue.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> notes that the company was still selling those bikes until April this year.</p><p>Peloton also had to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-recalls-22-million-bikes-over-safety-issues-170641578.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">recall 2.2 million base Bike units</a> in May 2023 over a seat post issue.

And since it’s become more of a month-long affair than a one-day event, it’s a good time to pick up things for yourself and for other people while you can save some money in the process. But to say money is tight is an understatement this year. If Amazon’s<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.numerator.com/prime-big-deal-days/"> Prime Big Deal Days was any indicator</a>, folks are spending more on essentials than anything else right now.

<p>Even if that’s the case, I’d recommend not overlooking tech entirely this Black Friday. Besides, all of us have essential tech that we use every day; more often than not, you can avoid paying full price for most of those devices (and all of the rest of the<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-2025-114500543.html"> best tech of the year</a>) if you&#39;re looking to add to your repertoire or need a replacement. Personally, I&#39;m not eyeing a new smartphone or laptop this holiday shopping season, but there are a few tech purchases I’d like to make if the prices are right. This is the tech I’m hoping to save on this year during Black Friday.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/ring-announces-retinal-4k-vision-and-search-party-for-finding-pets-143314419.html">Ring</a> is today announcing Single Event Alert, the company’s new approach to cutting down on unnecessary notifications. Rather than a ping every time the camera watches something unfold, the system uses generative AI to group recurring events together.</p>
<p>Historically, whenever your Ring camera detected something happening in its field of vision, it’d let you know. Hell, in the earliest days of Ring’s doorbells, you’d get a little tinkling motion alert even if a sufficiently big truck went past your door enough to change the light levels.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company uses the example of your kids playing in the back yard, which would previously trigger an alert every time it detected motion. Now, once it’s identified that it’s just your kids playing, it’ll tell you once and then let you get back to whatever else you were doing.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of turns toward AI Ring has enabled in the last year or so, including <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-adds-ai-enabled-smart-video-search-as-part-of-its-upcoming-20-subscription-service-130049585.html">Smart Video Search</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/rings-ai-video-descriptions-tell-you-whos-doing-what-130048789.html">AI Video Descriptions</a>. Like those features, Single Event Alert is rolling out to Ring Protect Home subscribers in the US (except IL) and Canada from today.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-uses-generative-ai-to-cut-down-on-unnecessary-alerts-150033561.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two former Meta employees are launching a new AI-powered smart ring. Stream Ring is the debut product from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.sandbar.com/"><ins>Sandbar,</ins></a> and it’s available to pre-order right now. Sandbar describes Stream as &quot;your extended self,&quot; which is to say that it’s a deliberately minimalist smart ring that you can use to take voice notes and interact with a chatbot directly using the built-in touch-activated microphone.</p>
<p>When you create a voice note, the Stream Ring uses haptic feedback to confirm that it’s been recorded. You hold the sensor to speak and tap it if you want to interrupt and start over. It can automatically transcribe your voice interactions, whether you’re simply compiling a grocery list on the go, asking it to fetch some information from the web, or having a more back-and-forth conversation with the device. These notes will appear in the Stream app via Bluetooth, which will be iOS-only at launch.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sandbar thinks a ring is the best form for its wearable to take as it’s always available and accessible, whatever you’re doing, so you easily can log a thought as soon as it pops into your head. It wants people to think of the Stream Ring as a &quot;mouse for voice,&quot; and says the mic will always be able to pick up your voice clearly in a noisy room. Crucially, it isn’t always listening either, only activating when you hold the touchpad.</p>
<p>As for the chatbot, it’s designed by default to somewhat mimic your own voice using AI, a feature Sandbar calls Inner Voice. You can update it if you think it sounds off, or if the whole concept creeps you out you can also switch to a non-personalized voice. Away from the core voice note functionality, the Stream Ring can also be used to control media playback using gestures, and Sandbar says it’s compatible with any headphones.</p>
<p>Sandbar will offer a free plan that includes unlimited notes but limits AI interactions. For $10 per month you can upgrade to a Stream Pro subscription (you get three months for free with a new purchase), which enables unlimited chats and immediate access to any new features. Sandbar says your data is encrypted at rest and in transit and it will not sell your information to other companies. You can also delete data stored in the app at any time.</p>
<p>Other smart rings have <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/this-ring-lets-you-whisper-to-your-phone-because-sometimes-we-need-to-use-our-inside-voices-002529204.html"><ins>promised</ins></a> a seamless interactive experience built around AI, and the Stream Ring isn’t going down the health tracking route that many other <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smart-ring-140000425.html"><ins>products</ins></a> in this increasingly crowded space market themselves on. But if the transcription feature works as reliably as advertised and Sandbar’s AI proves to be a genuinely useful assistant, the Stream Ring could be a useful accessory that doesn’t get in the way when it isn’t needed.</p>
<p>The Stream Ring is available in sizes 5-13 and is designed to be worn on your index finger. Sandbar promises &quot;all-day battery life&quot; but doesn’t go into specifics. It’s expected to start shipping next summer in the US and costs $249.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ai-powered-stream-ring-is-designed-for-on-the-fly-voice-notes-143530840.html?src=rss]]></description>

This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That&#39;s with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours.

<p>It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter.</p> 
<p>The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle.</p>

Deep Research uses sources from the web to write reports for you, but now a new update also allows it to pull information from your Gmail, Docs, Drive and Chat. Google says it’s one of the tool’s most requested features, and you’ll be able to take advantage of it in Gemini, even if you’re not paying for a subscription. </p><p>With Google’s latest update, Deep Research is now able to use your emails, all the Slides, Docs, Sheets and PDFs in your Drive, as well your chat history as references. That translates to a more personalized report, since Gemini wouldn’t just be using sources from the web. If you ask it to write a marketing analysis for you, for instance, it will take into account your notes, any document your team has written or any back-and-forth between you and your colleagues on email. It can cross-reference information from your account with public data to make, say, comparison spreadsheets for competitor analysis. </p><p>Take note that you will be able to control which Google service to link to, if you’re uneasy about giving Gemini access to all your information. When you click on the Deep Research tool in Gemini, you’ll see a drop-down menu where you can tick on Search, Gmail, Drive and Chat individually. At the moment, the feature is only available on desktop, but it will make its way to mobile devices “in the coming days.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-gemini-can-now-do-deep-research-on-your-gmail-and-drive-data-143000300.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Switch 2 edition of <em>Overcooked 2</em> drops today, which is something we&#39;ve known <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-metroid-virtual-boy-and-more-all-the-biggest-announcements-from-todays-nintendo-direct-165722897.html"><ins>was coming since September</ins></a>. Now it&#39;s here and ready to ruin relationships and friendships.</p>
<p>The developer promises &quot;enhanced graphics in-line with PC&quot; and 4K 60 fps gameplay when docked. This should be a night-and-day graphical upgrade when compared to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/overcooked-2-switch-free-week-valentines-day-151552069.html"><ins>original Switch version</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Perhaps the biggest news here is Camera Play integration. This is a feature exclusive to Nintendo&#39;s new console and it leverages a connected camera to throw up the faces of players under their avatars. <em>Overcooked 2</em> is already a frantic experience, but now you&#39;ll be able to see the look on the faces of your friends as you royally screw up a burger order.</p>
<div id="e60cc73d912e4ae1b9d617f9015716a3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci9jNv_L3VE?si=3o9RUWnIU60WHolN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the Switch 2 doesn&#39;t come with a camera, but the company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-official-switch-2-accessories-include-a-camera-a-gamecube-controller-and-more-173912613.html"><ins>offers one as a standalone accessory</ins></a>. It also integrates with many USB-C cameras, including this <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html"><ins>Mario-themed work of art</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version also works with Game Share, which lets people hop onto a multiplayer match without actually owning the game. Basically, the person who owns the game &quot;shares&quot; it with someone who doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also cross-platform with the original Switch, which is neat given the massive user base. Upgrading seems like a simple affair, as DLC, save files and star ratings all carry over. This upgrade costs $10 and buying the game outright costs $30. However, there&#39;s a 20 percent discount for the first week.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/overcooked-2-drops-for-switch-2-today-and-it-makes-full-use-of-camera-play-140021993.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify delivers a lot of personalized, data-driven music recommendations, and now the streaming service is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-11-06/spotify-new-feature-listening-stats" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">adding</a> new weekly snapshots of your listening activities. Listening stats will highlight the artists and songs that a user has heard the most over the previous four weeks and creates a playlist inspired by those selections. And according to the blog post: &quot;Each week, it also includes a special highlight that captures what makes your listening unique, whether it’s a milestone, a new discovery, or a fan moment.&quot; That&#39;s a pretty vague introduction, and how engaging the highlights are in practice will likely depend on how much they actually surprise and delight listeners.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like a midway point between the company&#39;s year-end Wrapped data package and its daily mix playlists. More ways to view listening data are always fun, and several competing services like Apple Music, Amazon Music and YouTube Music have already upped how often they share reports with their users. This seems to be Spotify’s move to catch up on that trend.</p><p>The listening stats will live under your profile and can be shared internally on Spotify or as an external link. The new features will be available for both free and paying listeners across 60 international markets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-introduces-weekly-listening-stats-140000577.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monarch Money is one of our favorite budgeting apps and, fittingly enough, there&#39;s a way for newcomers to save money on a subscription right now. If you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=you+can+get+12+months+of+access+for+%2450+with+this+code.&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code.</a></p> 
<p>There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can&#39;t be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can&#39;t redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you&#39;ll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you&#39;ve set. There&#39;s also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what&#39;s been happening with your money that month. You&#39;ll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it&#39;s a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This story about Paul McCartney begins with one of his old bandmates. &quot;I&#39;m not really Beatle George,&quot; the ever-philosophical George Harrison once<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/31/willwoodward"> said</a>. &quot;For me, Beatle George was a suit or a shirt that I once wore. And the only problem is, for the rest of my life, people are going to look at that shirt and mistake it for me.&quot;</p> 
<p>On one hand, that’s, well, George being George. But his quote does speak to our need to mythologize the Beatles. It’s hard not to! The music is so exquisite, influential and timeless that we look for grand stories to tell about it. We want a stronger connection to it, so we pore over biographies, interviews and documentaries. We seek meaning and purpose in their story.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Still, it must be surreal to be one of the four protagonists of that story. At some point, the narrative takes on a life of its own that may not reflect your experience. McCartney alluded to that in the 2013 song &quot;Early Days.&quot; &quot;Now everybody seems to have their own opinion on who did this and who did that,&quot; he sang. &quot;But as for me, I don&#39;t see how they can remember when they weren&#39;t where it was at.&quot;</p> 
<p>So, I’ll try not to mythologize the Beatles too much as I describe my experience photographing Sir Paul McCartney last month. I will, of course, fail spectacularly at that mission.</p>

<p>Months before I watched him play for nearly three hours in front of 15,000 fans (at age 83!) at Albuquerque’s Isleta Amphitheater, I sent a press request to his team. A few days before the concert, I learned that my photography pass had been approved. Once it sank in, I screamed and giggled, not unlike the teenagers in Ed Sullivan&#39;s audience. (Don&#39;t judge those gals until you&#39;ve been near a Beatle!)</p>

<p>Was it the best one available? Not at all. But instead of renting a $3,000 camera, I decided to buy something in my budget that I&#39;ll enjoy using for years. I&#39;d already eyed it after handling a display model and reading <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r50-camera-review-123006238.html">Steve Dent&#39;s review</a>.

This choice was simple: It was by far the most concert-appropriate lens available to rent.

The photography area was about 150 yards from the stage and didn’t allow for lateral movement, so ideas for creative compositions were set aside. My only option was to push that glass out to 200mm (or close to it) and fire away. Save those composition ideas for when it&#39;s time to crop.</p> 
<p>When photographing someone like Sir Paul, you ideally want an image that captures not only the man and the musician, but also that larger-than-life myth. It should be something grand that you’d want to hang on your wall. No pressure!</p>

(I didn&#39;t end up needing them, despite snapping over 600 photos.)</p> 
<p>McCartney transitioned into his second number, &quot;Coming Up,&quot; the first track from 1980&#39;s <em>McCartney II</em>. That LP was ahead of its time, embracing synths, drum machines and other studio tricks before they became commonplace. Contemporary critics didn’t care much for it, but it later became a cult classic. That combination illustrates something about his solo career: always experimenting, sometimes misunderstood, but ultimately vindicated.</p> 
<p>Two songs were over in a flash. Macca addressed the crowd, and picture time was over. Off to leave my camera with security, and claim the faraway lawn seat I bought long before I knew I&#39;d have press access.</p> 
<p>The rest of McCartney&#39;s set included a perfect balance of Beatles, Wings and solo numbers. (There was even an old Quarrymen song, &quot;In Spite of All the Danger.&quot;) As you can see in the photos, he started on his trademark Höfner bass. But he moved on to piano, acoustic and electric guitars and ukulele. The latter was for his beautiful rendition of Harrison&#39;s &quot;Something.&quot;</p> 
<p>That number wasn’t the only point that moved me. The most notable was where he teamed with Lennon on &quot;I&#39;ve Got a Feeling.&quot; Present-day McCartney singing with 1969 Lennon, who appeared on the giant screen above (via the restored rooftop concert footage in <em>Get Back</em>), was profound. &quot;I love that one because I get to sing with John again,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Sir Paul strikes me as someone who’s always looking forward. But the <em>Got Back</em> tour is a chance to look back. It lets us, the romanticizing fans, join him on the long and winding road from the Quarrymen to today. The entire production made me feel like a passenger on his journey.</p> 
<p>I could go on. But you don&#39;t need me to elevate Paul McCartney&#39;s musical legacy any more than you need me to explain Michael Jordan&#39;s basketball skills or Meryl Streep&#39;s acting chops. Listen to the music — and catch his tour if you can — and you&#39;ll feel it.</p> 
<p>As for the photos, my favorite is the one at the top of this article. (I also included a color version in the gallery below.) It’s the only one that (to me) captures the man, musician and myth as he plays his Höfner bass. Out of more than 600 rapidly-fired photos, one that feels just right is good enough for me.</p> 
<p>But even if they all sucked, who cares! Decades from now, I&#39;ll tell everyone at the old folks&#39; home that, when I was young (and my heart was an open book), I snapped some pictures of Sir Paul McCartney. The story may grow more inflated by then, and maybe I’ll invent new details. But perhaps I can be forgiven for a bit of mythologizing.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="79ffc5c3-cd56-4a4a-ac7b-a2d4f0418432"/>

The device normally costs $100. The Amazon deal applies to both color options, White and the soft gray Haze.</p> 
<p>The Google TV Streamer is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device</a>. It has a faster processor than Google&#39;s previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="19861e84880547b7a1b7e067db74cdcb" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN1N8HGT"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV.</p> 
<p>The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you&#39;ll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don&#39;t already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brewing beer can be a highly polluting activity because gas boilers are normally used to create the enormous volumes of steam required for the process. Now, Heineken is teaming with a battery and electric company on a new solution at its Lisbon, Portugal brewery. They&#39;re building a 100MWh grid- and solar-powered <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sand-battery-stores-renewable-energy-as-heat-124512914.html">heat battery</a> that will generate the steam while reducing carbon emissions, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theheinekencompany.com/newsroom/heineken-pioneers-one-of-the-largest-heat-battery-system-in-portugal-in-partnership-with-edp-and-rondo-energy/">Heineken announced</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heat batteries use materials like ceramics to store and then release heat, much as a regular battery stores and releases electricity. Heineken&#39;s brewery will employ a Rondo Heat Battery (RHB) built with refractory bricks that capture heat, then convert it to steam. When completed, it will be powered by onsite solar and renewable electricity from EDP and supply 7 MW of steam — enough to run the brewery 24 hours a day. When the system goes live in April 2027, it will be one of the largest heat battery systems in the beverage industry.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a significant milestone for the industry, as high temperature steam is one of the hardest things to produce with electricity. It&#39;s a key part of Heineken&#39;s goal to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2040 while also being a win for Portugal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas pollution 55 percent by 2030.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system will be hands-off for Heineken, as EDP will take care of building and running it, and Rondo will supply the battery technology. &quot;This project not only helps us reduce our reliance on conventional energy, it shows how practical innovation and strong partnerships can deliver meaningful improvements across our supply chain,&quot; said Heineken VP Magne Setnes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/your-next-heineken-beer-may-be-brewed-with-steam-from-a-100mwh-heat-battery-130045925.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IKEA has officially announced its range of Matter-compatible smart home products. The Swedish furniture store is releasing 21 new items under the tentpoles of lighting, sensors and control. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-goes-all-in-on-matter-with-new-smart-home-products-144232740.html">IKEA teased these releases</a> back in July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the roll out will include updates to existing categories in order to work with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html">Matter</a>, an open source smart home standard. &quot;We&#39;re upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges,&quot; Stjepan Begic, product developer at IKEA. &quot;Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the products themselves, 11 come as part of the KAJPLATS smart bulb range. They will have a mix of shapes and sizes, along with dimming functionality. Then there&#39;s the five smart sensors., starting with an indoor and outdoor motion sensor called MYGGSPRAY, which automatically turns on lights. Similarly, there&#39;s MYGGBETT, which sends a notification when a door or window gets opened or closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the more technical safety side are sensors like TIMMERFLOTTE, which monitors temerature and humidity. Then there&#39;s ALPSTUGA, an air quality sensor and KLIPPBOK, a water leakage sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finishing the lineup is a range of remote controls and one smart plug, GRILLPLATS, which works with regular lamps and appliances to turn them on and off, along with tracking energy use. Then there&#39;s the four BILRESA products, starting with a dual button remote control that can turn lights on and off, adjust the brightness, and create a preset scene. Meanwhile, the remote control with a scroll wheel does similar functions, along with dimming. Two kits of three controls each are available for each type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-and-ikea-end-their-partnership-130052348.html">IKEA</a> doesn&#39;t include exact pricing or release dates, noting that it might vary market to market. In its July teaser, the company said these products would be available come January next year.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-announces-new-matter-compatible-smart-home-products-120013040.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Wi-Fi mesh system is one of the best upgrades you can make to improve your home’s internet coverage, especially if you’ve ever struggled with dead zones, buffering or dropped video calls. Unlike a single router that broadcasts from one central point, a mesh system uses multiple access points spread throughout your space to blanket your entire home with a strong, seamless Wi-Fi signal. Whether you&#39;re working on multiple laptops, streaming 4K video in the living room or gaming online in the basement, a mesh setup helps ensure you get reliable Wi-Fi wherever you are.<br><br>These systems are designed to handle the demands of modern households, offering features like dual-band or even tri-band connectivity to balance your bandwidth across devices, and automatic updates to keep your firmware current. Many also support high-speed internet plans and include options for a wired connection if you need extra stability for gaming or work. With easy setup, smart app controls and long-term future-proofing, the best mesh Wi-Fi router systems can eliminate the need for clunky Wi-Fi extenders and give you fast, dependable Wi-Fi connections across your whole home.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-mesh-wi-fi-system"><strong>What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system</strong></h2>
<p>Linksys’ CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an “advancement in Wi-Fi technology” over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn’t ideal. “You can have a small [home], but there’s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,” he said.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Historically, the solution to a home’s Wi-Fi dead zone was to buy a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html">Wi-Fi extender</a> but Bettino said the hardware has both a “terrible user experience” and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh Wi-Fi, by comparison, offers “multiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,” says Bettino, resulting in “ubiquitous Wi-Fi” that feels as if you have a “router in every room.”</p>
<p>Rather than having one main router in your home, having a “router in every room” is the biggest selling point for mesh Wi-Fi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your connected devices. There’s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to.</p>
<p>It’s a good time to buy a mesh Wi-Fi system since the latest standard, Wi-Fi 6E, represents a big leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco&#39;s Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big “inflection point,” using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. “If you’re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],” he said, “you’re going to get significant gains [in speed.]”</p>
<p>MacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely “carry you for a long time” thanks to the fact its “top throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.” In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-do-all-these-wi-fi-numbers-and-letters-mean">What do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean?</h3>
<p><em>I’m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it’s worth it.</em></p>
<p>Wi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on.</p>
<p>Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we’re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-wi-fi-6-and-wi-fi-6e">What’s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E?</h3>
<p>Wi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That’s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn’t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-youre-going-to-talk-about-wireless-frequencies-now-arent-you">You’re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren’t you.</h3>
<p>Each Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren’t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it’s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-so-what-am-i-looking-for">So, what am I looking for?</h3>
<p>Right now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it’s what we think it’s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone’s at-home Wi-Fi needs.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-wi-fi-7">What about Wi-Fi 7?</h3>
<p>We’re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don’t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there’s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it’s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home’s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I’d estimate you won’t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-range-and-speed"><strong>Range and speed</strong></h3>
<p>All Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality — but these figures don’t mean much. After all, manufacturers can’t control your ISP’s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn’t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you’ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won’t need a mesh router that offers that spec.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-backhaul"><strong>Backhaul</strong></h3>
<p>Mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination.</p>
<p>To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity"><strong>Connectivity</strong></h3>
<p>These days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips’ Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter.</p>
<p>It’s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it’s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses — if it’s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router’s specs via the manufacturer’s website to be sure.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-flexibility-and-scalability"><strong>Flexibility and scalability</strong></h3>
<p>Mesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link’s Alan Jones said users should “check how scalable the prospective product is” before you buy. This sense of scale doesn’t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle.</p>
<p>It’s also worth looking at ASUS’ AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard “spider” Wi-Fi routers. If you’ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-placement"><strong>Placement</strong></h3>
<p>Mesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don’t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-amazon-eero-pro-7">Amazon Eero Pro 7</h3>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/eero-pro-7-review-paying-to-be-sold-a-subscription-171502767.html">Eero</a> built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company’s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-amazon-eero-6e">Amazon Eero 6E</h3>
<p>Eero Pro 6E is an “easy” device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There’s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-netgear-orbi-960">Netgear Orbi 960</h3>
<p>The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It&#39;s a fantastic piece of gear, but it&#39;s worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-wi-fi-routers">How we test Wi-Fi routers</h2>
<p>My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors.</p>
<p>For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place.</p>
<p>Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-mesh-wi-fi-system-faqs">Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs</h2>
<p>This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-wi-fi-router-and-a-mesh-router">What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router?</h3>
<p>A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade.</p>
<p>That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-wi-fi-extender-and-a-mesh-system">What&#39;s the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system?</h3>
<p>Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and <em>I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time</em>. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-wireless-backhaul">What is a wireless backhaul?</h3>
<p>As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination.</p>
<p>To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-is-it-better-to-hard-wire-instead-of-using-a-mesh-wi-fi-system">Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system?</h3>
<p>This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer.</p>
<p>It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors.</p>
<p>If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds.</p>
<p>But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill.</p>
<p>When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last time I used a set of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Noble Audio</a> earbuds, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-fokus-rex5-review-incredible-sound-if-youre-willing-to-pay-for-it-130043824.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">managed to pack five drivers</a> into the tiny housings. Now it’s back with a new model, the FoKus Prestige Encore, and despite only having four drivers this time, the company still took plenty of cues from its line of pro-grade in-ear monitors (IEMs). The biggest downside is that this new set is still plenty pricey, hitting your wallet for $699. </p>
<p>Inside, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://nobleaudio.com/collections/wireless-monitors" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">FoKus Prestige Encore</a> has one 8mm dynamic driver, two balanced armature drivers and one 6mm planar magnetic driver. According to Noble, each of these components have different duties. The dynamic drivers handle bass while the midrange goes to the Knowles balanced armature drivers. Lastly, the planar magnetic driver is tasked with the treble to “reveal microdetail.” The company says it also designed new “triple-vented” nozzles to make airflow efficient and the seal consistent. </p>

<p>Rather than using plastic or some other affordable material, Noble opted for solid wood for both the earbud housings and the charging case. Since this is the real thing and not a printed plate, each set of the FoKus Prestige Encore will have its own unique grain pattern — no two sets will look the same. What’s more, Noble reduced the overall size of the buds, which it says offers “a secure, fatigue-free fit.” </p>
<p>The FoKus Prestige Encore is equipped with hybrid active noice cancellation (ANC) and a transparency mode. The earbuds also support aptX Lossless, aptX Adaptive and LDAC for higher quality listening. For calls, dual noise suppression mics won’t overly process your voice for the sake of reducing background distractions, which Noble says will keep you sounding clear and natural in all settings. </p>
<p>Noble promises up to seven hours of use on a charge with ANC enabled or up to 10 hours with noise canceling turned off. When you factor in the case, you’re looking at up to 35 hours of total listening time. A quick-charge features will give you up to two hours of playback. The FoKus Prestige Encore also supports Audiodo for personalized calibration for each user’s hearing, and those profiles are stored on the earbuds for use on any device. </p>
<p>The Fokus Prestige Encore is available starting today for $699 (£649/€799).</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html"> live TV streaming services</a> over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now.

<p>We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0">who Pepe Silvia is</a> when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart</a>, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

<p>The new 32.5MP sensor provides a big boost in resolution compared to the R6 II's 24MP chip. At the same time, the R6 III offers higher shooting speeds of 40 fps in burst mode with the electronic shutter, or 12 fps with the mechanical or first-curtain shutter. It also supports 20 frames (a half second) of pre-shooting so you won't miss key moments for wildlife or sports shooting.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The R6 III uses Canon's fast and dependable Dual Pixel AF system and comes with the company's latest AI tracking algorithms. It can operate in fairly dim conditions down to -6 EV and should be more responsive with Canon's latest Digic X processor, pending our review. It offers subject tracking for people, animals and vehicles, along with an Auto mode that will pick one of those automatically. It also borrowed the "Register People Priority" feature from the R5 II, which lets you keep focus locked on specific subjects that you've previously memorized.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The biggest update for the R6 III, though, is with video. Thanks to the higher resolution sensor, it can now capture up to 7K 60 fps RAW light video, 7K 30 fps "open gate" video and 4K at up to 120 fps, all with Canon's C-Log2 and C-Log3 on tap. There's a dizzying array of other video formats available (12 pages worth in the specs), with HEVC S, AVC-S, RAW, RAW Light and others, at resolutions up to 7K. All the AF subject detection features are available (vehicles, animals and people), and Canon is typically among the best for video AF in terms of speed and accuracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nobody expects any radical design changes in a Canon camera (the company tried that with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-12-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-review.html">EOS R</a> and it <em>really</em> didn't work), so the R6 III kept the last model's tried and true form factor. That includes two adjustment dials on the top and one on the rear, along with a joystick, photo/video selector, mode dial and a good assortment of programmable buttons.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The rear display flips out as you'd expect for vlogging, but it doesn't tilt like Panasonic's S1 II — so it may obstruct the mic or headphone jacks, and isn't as useful for low-angle photo shooting. The viewfinder has 3.69 million dots of resolution as before, the same as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">Sony's A7 IV</a> but less than Panasonic's slightly more expensive <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/panasonic-s1-ii-review-a-near-perfect-creators-camera-if-money-is-no-object-174509182.html">Lumix S1 II</a>. One big change is the addition of a CFexpress card slot that allows RAW video capture and faster burst speeds, along with an SD UHS II slot. The battery is the same as the one for <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-eos-r5-ii-review-canons-most-powerful-camera-yet-puts-sony-on-notice-160013865.html">EOS R5 II</a> and allows up to 390 shots (CIPA rating) with the viewfinder enabled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other features include waveform monitoring that will be much appreciated by pros, plus new focus speed algorithms borrowed from Canon's cinema cameras that offer "natural, professional" behavior, the company wrote. Inputs include 3.5mm mic and headphone jacks, along with high-speed USB-C and a full-sized HDMI port. In-body stabilization has been boosted slight from 8 to 8.5 stops, matching the latest Panasonic models.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Along with the EOS R6 III, Canon introduced some interesting new glass.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap and Perplexity AI have struck a $400 million deal that will bring the AI search engine directly to Snapchat sometime in &quot;early 2026,&quot; the two companies <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2025/Snap-and-Perplexity-Partner-to-Bring-Conversational-AI-Search-to-Snapchat/default.aspx" data-i13n="slk:announced;cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a>. With the partnership, Perplexity&#39;s AI search engine will be a prominent part of Snapchat&#39;s &quot;chat&quot; interface so users can &quot;ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat.&quot;</p><p>The news was announced alongside the company&#39;s third-quarter earnings. The company said that revenue from the deal — Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million for the integration — is &quot;expected to begin contributing&quot; to the company&#39;s bottom line in 2026. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investor.snap.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Investor-Letter.pdf" data-i13n="slk:a letter;cpos:2;pos:1">a letter</a> to shareholders, CEO Evan Spiegel also hinted that Snap could pursue similar partnerships with other AI companies. &quot;This collaboration makes AI-powered discovery native to Snapchat, enhances personalization, and positions Snap as a leading distribution channel for intelligent agents, laying the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of AI partners to reach our global community,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Snap, like its peers, has been leaning into generative AI in recent years. The company has its own LLM-powered chatbot, called MyAI, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-is-redesigning-snapchat-and-adding-new-ai-powers-171552703.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">uses models</a> from OpenAI, Google and, soon, Perplexity AI. Snap has also introduced AI-powered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-launches-generative-ai-video-lenses-130056731.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">lenses</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-now-has-a-standalone-app-for-making-gen-ai-augmented-reality-effects-170036214.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">creation tools</a>, which have helped boost its Snapchat+ subscription service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spiegel also teased other AI-powered updates coming to Snapchat. He said the company is working on a new AI video generation feature called &quot;AI Clips&quot; that &quot;will allow creators to generate short, shareable videos from simple prompts.&quot; He didn’t say when the feature might launch.</p><p>Outside of Snapchat, Snap is also planning on launching a new version of its AR glasses, called Specs, s<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">ometime next year</a>. Spiegel didn’t offer any new details about the device, which he has previously promised will be lighter-weight than the current version. He did, however, suggest the company was considering working with potential hardware partners.  He said Snap would be “putting Specs into their own standalone, 100% owned subsidiary” to give the company more flexibility to pursue such arrangements. </p><p><strong>Update, November 5, 2025,  3:08PM PT:</strong> Added more details from Snap’s earnings call.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-and-perplexity-sign-400-million-deal-to-put-ai-search-directly-in-snapchat-221101734.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hilarious co-op video game <em>Overcooked</em> is making the move to the real world. A24 has acquired the rights to the popular indie hit and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports that the company is working with Netflix to develop the concept into an unscripted competition reality TV series. I adore this idea, and with the right people behind it, I think it could be a masterwork of reality TV. According to the reports, this is the first time independent film and TV studio A24 will make a reality show, but Netflix has already had some success with food and cooking programs, such as with the absolute gem that is <em>Nailed It!</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The often ridiculous antics of <em>Overcooked</em> are a wonderful match for that type of lighthearted competition show. In the game, one to four players work together to cook customers&#39; food orders as quickly as possible while the environment creates silly, unexpected obstacles. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way the Netflix legal team will green light challenges where contestants might fall into actual lava, and recreating the space travel levels would probably blow the budget. But I can see all sorts of <em>Overcooked</em>-style mayhem from sliding on icy floors or suddenly moving countertops. I’m also imagining a lot of dashing between inconveniently placed kitchen appliances and occasionally plunging the contestants into total darkness. There’s no timeline given in <em>Deadline</em>’s report, but I cannot wait for this to exist. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/co-op-game-overcooked-may-become-a-competition-reality-tv-show-on-netflix-222406920.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley has unveiled his latest venture and yes, it&#39;s another location-based social app. But, rather than the check-ins Crowley first popularized more than 15 years ago, &quot;BeeBot&quot; has a very 2025 take on the concept. Instead, the app is an AI-powered &quot;DJ&quot; that can deliver contextual audio updates to your ears as you move through your day.&nbsp;</p><p>Crowley describes BeeBot as an &quot;app for AirPods,&quot; though it will work with any type of headphones, as well as smart glasses with audio capabilities like Meta&#39;s. &quot;Whenever you put your AirPods in, it turns on,&quot; Crowley explains in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://dens.medium.com/say-hello-to-dj-beebot-592cdc1f1704" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a post</a> on Medium. &quot;Whenever you take your AirPods out it turns off. And when it’s &#39;on&#39; it’ll push you snippets of audio about the people, places, and events that are nearby.&#39;</p><p>To do this, you&#39;ll need to give the app access to your location and share a handful of &quot;keywords&quot; about your interests. You can also share your contacts to get updates from friends who are using the app. The BeeBot &quot;DJ,&quot; which of course has an AI voice, will then be able to talk to you as you throughout the dat and alert you to interesting events, landmarks or updates from friends who happen to be nearby.&nbsp;</p><div><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:400px;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/qtKztQ8e" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><p>In some ways, it sounds like Crowley is trying to re-create some of the serendipitous IRL social interactions enabled by the original version of Foursquare. BeeBot doesn&#39;t have &quot;mayorships,&quot; badges or any of the gamification features that helped popularize FourSquare, but it&#39;s meant to have some of the &quot;same playful spirit,&quot; of OG Foursquare, according to Crowley. (Foursquare <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/foursquare-is-killing-its-city-guide-app-to-focus-on-the-check-in-app-swarm-191054153.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shut down</a> its city guide app of the same name earlier this year, though its check-in app, Swarm, lives on.)</p><p>&nbsp;And, because it&#39;s 2025, there&#39;s also a whole bunch of AI thrown in, including &quot;a mix of different LLMs&quot; and &quot;synthetic voices.&quot; The app is &quot;powered by a TikTok-style algorithm,&quot; Crowley says, &quot;but one that’s focused on what’s happening nearby and IRL.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>There also seems to be a bit of DNA <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-24-foursquare-marsbot-text-bot-food.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">from Marsbot</a>, the short-lived (and IMO very underrated) chat-based app Foursquare launched in 2016 that could proactively provide personalized restaurant recommendations. While BeeBot isn&#39;t as heavily focused on neighborhood recommendations as Foursquare, it is meant to proactively let you know about nearby happenings you might be interested in or even a bit of gossip from friends. In addition to friends&#39; status updates, the app will draw on local Substacks and newsletters for relevant info about a given area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crowley says the DJ&#39;s audio cues may &quot;occasionally&quot; interrupt your music or podcast to give an update, though users should expect to hear these only a couple times throughout the day. BeeBot won&#39;t interrupt voice or video calls.&nbsp;</p><p>BeeBot, which is the inaugural project of Crowley&#39;s new company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hopscotchlabs.co/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Hopscotch Labs</a>, is out now in the App Store, though it&#39;s still &quot;very much a work in progress,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@dens/post/DQrtmYhEUu4" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">according to</a> Crowley. &quot;I feel like the version of the product we’re sharing with folks today is kind of where Foursquare was when it launched at SXSW in 2009 – an interesting vision, a good-enough execution, but something that still needs to be shaped by the people using it to fully blossom.&quot; </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-foursquare-founders-new-app-is-an-ai-powered-dj-for-neighborhood-updates-202326296.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The company promises a &quot;sleek&quot; new look, but that&#39;s not the only change. This visual redesign should make it much easier to quickly glance at recent songs you&#39;ve identified via the Home tab. They now appear directly on the home screen.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a revamped toolbar that lets you quickly swap between different tabs, including one that lists nearby concerts. The search icon is now separated into its own button on the bottom of the app.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google and Epic Games have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-proposes-app-store-reforms-settlement-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-2025-11-05/">reached a settlement</a> that would bring their <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-match-google-antitrust-lawsuit-trial-date-223014942.html">years-long court battle</a> to a close. The companies have filed a proposal in the federal court of San Francisco, asking US District Judge James Donato to approve a modified version of the order he originally imposed on Google when it lost the case. &quot;Together with Epic Games we have filed a proposed set of changes to Android and Google Play that focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe,&quot; said Sameer Samat, the President of Android Ecosystem at Google, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343">on X</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613">praised</a> the proposal for &quot;genuinely [doubling] down on Android&#39;s original vision as an open platform to streamline competing store installs globally, reduce service fees for developers on Google Play and enable third-party in-app and web payments.&quot; Epic Games sued Google in 2020, accusing it of an illegal monopoly on app distribution and in-app billing services for Android devices.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The court <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/jury-sides-with-epic-games-in-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-032341810.html">sided with Epic Games</a> in late 2023, and Google <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-lost-its-antitrust-case-with-epic-again-190633325.html">lost its appeal</a> in July this year. Google tried to <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-asks-supreme-court-to-rescue-it-from-its-epic-lawsuit-195555490.html">ask the Supreme Court</a> to block the injunction Donato handed down, which required the company to make major changes to the Play Store, while it appealed the case again. But the Supreme Court <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/supreme-court-denies-googles-request-to-pause-play-store-changes-while-it-appeals-epic-case-121502132.html">denied its request</a>. That means Google will be prohibited from paying manufacturers and app developers to exclusively install and distribute on the Play Store, respectively. It will also be prohibited from forcing developers to only use its payment system, and it will have to allow third-party app stores to be installed on Android devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google will still have to follow most of Donato&#39;s orders under the proposal, but the companies made some modifications. To start with, they&#39;ve worked out how to &quot;allow developers and users to seamlessly use alternative payment mechanisms,&quot; both in-app and via external links, while adhering to Google&#39;s security and safety standards. They&#39;ve also specified the maximum fees Google can charge for both in-app and linked transactions, which are 9 percent or 20 percent, depending on the type of transaction. This fee cap also depends on when the app in question was installed. Specifically, the commission caps on third party in-app payment systems would only apply to new app installs.</p>
<p>The companies have identified &quot;reasonable, neutral criteria&quot; that third-party stores would be required to meet, as well. Users will easily be able to download stores that meet those criteria so they can compete against the Play Store and each other around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samat said that the companies are meeting with Judge Donato on Thursday, and if he approves of the proposal, it &quot;would resolve [the] litigations.&quot;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony AI released a dataset that tests the fairness and bias of AI models. It&#39;s called the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced like &quot;Phoebe&quot;). The company describes it as the &quot;first publicly available, globally diverse, consent-based human image dataset for evaluating bias across a wide variety of computer vision tasks.&quot; In other words, it tests the degree to which today&#39;s AI models treat people fairly. Spoiler: Sony didn&#39;t find a single dataset from any company that fully met its benchmarks.</p>
<p>Sony says FHIBE can address the AI industry&#39;s ethical and bias challenges. The dataset includes images of nearly 2,000 paid participants from over 80 countries. All of their likenesses were shared with consent — something that can&#39;t be said for the common practice of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-investigating-perplexity-ai-after-accusations-it-scrapes-websites-without-consent-133003374.html">scraping large volumes of web data</a>. Participants in FHIBE can remove their images at any time. Their photos include annotations noting demographic and physical characteristics, environmental factors and even camera settings.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tool &quot;affirmed previously documented biases&quot; in today&#39;s AI models. But Sony says FHIBE can also provide granular diagnoses of factors that led to those biases. One example: Some models had lower accuracy for people using &quot;she/her/hers&quot; pronouns, and FHIBE highlighted greater hairstyle variability as a previously overlooked factor.</p>
<p>FHIBE also determined that today&#39;s AI models reinforced stereotypes when prompted with neutral questions about a subject&#39;s occupation. The tested models were particularly skewed &quot;against specific pronoun and ancestry groups,&quot; describing subjects as sex workers, drug dealers or thieves. And when prompted about what crimes an individual committed, models sometimes produced &quot;toxic responses at higher rates for individuals of African or Asian ancestry, those with darker skin tones and those identifying as &#39;he/him/his.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Sony AI says FHIBE proves that ethical, diverse and fair data collection is possible. The tool is now <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fairnessbenchmark.ai.sony/">available to the public</a>, and it will be updated over time. A paper outlining the research was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09716-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em> on Wednesday.</p>
