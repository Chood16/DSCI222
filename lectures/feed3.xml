                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your neighborhood <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-gamestop-store-renovations.html">GameStop</a> might be on the chopping block, along with more than 400 other retail locations across the US. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/"><em>Polygon</em></a>, the retailer is pursuing a severe cost-saving measure by closing up several hundred physical locations. According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">blog</a> that keeps track of GameStop closures, there are 410 locations that are confirmed to be closing or are already closed, along with another 11 that are reportedly also on their way, as of January 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <em>Polygon</em> indicated, these closings aren&#39;t much of a surprise considering GameStop&#39;s SEC filing for December 2025 indicated that it would &quot;anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025,&quot; which ends on January 31, 2026. The same filing detailed that the company&#39;s board would pay out the GameStop CEO, Ryan Cohen, up to $35 billion in stock options, given that he increases the retailer&#39;s market cap to $100 billion.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the blog covers only closures in the US, the SEC filing also noted that GameStop is planning to reduce its presence in several other European countries and Canada. Even though GameStop saw a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-reddit-ceo-testify-house-gamestop-hearing-152845471.html">historic spike</a> in market value in 2021, it has struggled with the brand&#39;s direction, as seen with failed attempts at offering a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestops-nft-wallet-will-shut-down-in-november-164252057.html">crypto locker</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-axes-its-short-lived-nft-marketplace-as-it-retreats-from-crypto-215911813.html">an NFT marketplace</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gamestop-reportedly-shuts-down-more-than-400-us-stores-210632743.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you received a bunch of password reset requests from Instagram recently, you&#39;re not alone. As reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malwarebytes.com/post/3mbywfybiil26">Malwarebytes</a>, an antivirus software company, there was a data breach revealing the &quot;sensitive information&quot; of 17.5 million Instagram users. Malwarebytes added that the leak included Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and more.</p>
<p>The company added that the &quot;data is available for sale on the dark web and can be abused by cybercriminals.&quot; Malwarebytes noted in an email to its customers that it discovered the breach during its routine dark web scan and that it&#39;s tied to a potential incident related to an Instagram API exposure from 2024.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reported breach has resulted in users receiving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q93j15/instagram_data_leak_exposes_sensitive_info_of/">several</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q8pcq1/is_someone_trying_to_hack_me/">emails</a> from Instagram about password reset requests. According to Malwarebytes, the leaked information could lead to more serious attacks, like phishing attempts or account takeovers. Meta hasn&#39;t released an official statement about the latest incident, but it&#39;s not the first time Instagram&#39;s parent company has been in hot water for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-gdpr-data-breach-eu-fine-173528015.html">data breaches</a>. If you haven&#39;t already, it&#39;s always a good idea to turn on two-factor authentication and change your password. Even better, you can review what devices are logged into your Instagram account in Meta&#39;s Accounts Center.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/an-instagram-data-breach-reportedly-exposed-the-personal-info-of-175-million-users-192105616.html?src=rss]]></description>

In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA</a>, Larian Studio&#39;s CEO, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6">Swen Vicke</a>, said that the team would have loved to bring the title to Switch 2, but &quot;it wasn&#39;t our decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>As cryptic as that may sound, Vicke&#39;s response hints that either Wizards of the Coast, which owns the Dungeons and Dragons IP that <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em> is set in, or Nintendo is behind the lack of a port. When it comes to Wizards of the Coast, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501?s=20">rumors</a> have circulated that the game studio and Wizards of the Coast may have a strained relationship.

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s still a chance that Wizards of the Coast decides to hire another studio to pursue a port in the future, but there&#39;s been no indication yet. As for why <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-confirms-it-wont-make-the-sequel-091930642.html">Larian Studios</a> won&#39;t be behind a potential Switch 2 port, the developer said in a statement last year that it would no longer develop any major content updates or expansions for <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em>, nor work on a sequel.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/dont-count-on-baldurs-gate-3-coming-to-switch-2-as-least-for-now-180538969.html?src=rss]]></description>

It has also allowed SpaceX to upgrade its Gen2 satellites with “advanced form factors and cutting-edge technology,” to operate across more frequencies and to add more orbital shells to optimize coverage and performance.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At every CES I’ve ever been to, there’s been one or two gadgets promising to boost your mental health. In recent years, the number of companies making forays into this space has grown, and will likely continue to do so in the future. Could it be, much like the number of people wearing heart-monitoring wearables today, everyone will be strapping an EEG to their skulls a decade or so down the line? It’s more likely than you think, so it’s worth asking what these devices are good for, what benefit they could bring, and where does the science end and the hype begin.</p><p>An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a clinical tool to monitor the electrical activity of our brains. Put very simply, our minds are constantly moving ions around, and when they reach the scalp, it’s possible to measure those ions. By placing electrodes on the scalp, you can record the changes in voltages pushed out by our brains more or less in real time. These voltages are commonly grouped into categories, which are often described as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://nin.nl/about-the-brain/brain-waves/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">brain waves</a>. Each one <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/brain-waves" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">represents</a> a different state of mind: Gamma (hard thinking), Beta (anxious or active), Alpha (relaxed), Theta (creative, or dreaming) and Delta (asleep).&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2747-karl-friston" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Professor Karl Friston</a> at University College London is one of the world’s most influential neuroscientists and an expert in brain imaging. He explained that these technologies can be used to diagnose issues both in the structure and function of the brain. And while there are many technologies which can look at how our brains work, “we’re a long way away from understanding the brain like we understand the heart.” Broadly speaking, EEGs are a fairly simple tool for looking at how our minds work, but they have one benefit over more complex methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), since they work in real time.</p><p>Consumer-use EEGs are nothing new — in 2011 I tested the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-09-28-zeo-mobile-turns-phones-into-a-sleep-clinic-aids-in-advanced-po.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Zeo Mobile</a>, a small device which you stuck to your forehead and wore overnight. It monitored how well you slept and sounded an alarm when you were at the top of a sleep cycle, so you woke up pretty easily. It worked well but with one downside: It’s hard to sleep with a hard plastic puck stuck to your forehead.</p><p>EEGs are more recently used as part of brain computer interfaces, or for neurofeedback tools to help you calibrate the quality of your meditation. InteraXon, for instance, makes the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/muses-new-wearable-eeg-knows-how-hard-youre-thinking-120041154.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Muse</a> headbands which will monitor your brain waves, telling you when you shift states. Last year, EEG startup Neurable partnered with Master &amp; Dynamic to launch the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/neurables-brainwave-tracking-master--dynamic-headphones-tell-you-when-to-take-a-break-120004736.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">MW75S Neuro</a>, a pair of high-end headphones designed to track your focus levels. When your attention starts to wane, the system will alert you, advising you to take a rest with the hope of alleviating burnout.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1800px;" alt="Neurable" data-uuid="30ad23d1-6c56-4a60-aec7-95ae6e6ac554"/><figcaption>Neurable</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>At CES this year, Neurable announced a partnership with HP’s gaming arm HyperX to produce EEG headsets with specific benefits for gamers. As gamers are looking for any way to improve their performance, the company has developed algorithms and training programs to help. You might already know that being in a place of high stress isn’t great for your concentration and focus. Consequently, Neurable research scientist Dr. Alicia Howell-Munson walked me through a system that encourages you to reach a state of calm focus with demonstrable improvements in reaction time and accuracy. It’s a system that was initially designed in partnership with Singapore’s Air Force to help ensure pilots remain in a state of calm focus.&nbsp;</p><p>I sat through this demo myself, initially testing my skills in Aimlabs (a tool people use to test their reflexes) where my accuracy and reaction times were measured. Then, while wearing Neurable’s headset, I had to practice focusing my attention on a galaxy of dots, the greater my focus, the slower and closer together the dots got. That wasn’t an easy process, and it took me nearly five minutes to reach the point where I could push all of the dots to coalesce into a single point on the screen. But, when I had, I retook the shooting gallery, and saw dramatic spikes in my performance. My accuracy increased from 91.3 to 99.1 percent, while my reaction time fell from 623ms to 532ms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1800px;" alt="Neurable HyperX headset" data-uuid="faf3e60d-a791-4a8b-8e58-e2c86e36f5dc"/><figcaption>Neurable HyperX headset</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>Neurable believes that its systems, which are designed to integrate with any manufacturer’s gear, has the potential to dramatically increase a person’s brain health and productivity. For instance, by taking a break when a person’s focus started to wane, they were able to bounce back and function for far longer than if they’d simply pushed harder. Similarly, the company can advise on your cognitive speed and brain age and guide you toward making healthy choices. The company says that this isn’t just about wellness, either, as being able to identify loss of focus is vital, for instance, to help reduce auto accidents when truck drivers feel fatigued.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founder Adam Molnar explained that the benefits of this technology compound over time, so the more practice a user has in finding that mental state of calm focus, the easier it will be to maintain it for longer. CEO Ramses Alcaide added the company’s aim is to enable people to visualize the often invisible symptoms of cognitive stress to ensure they’re looking after themselves. He added that one thing that separates Neurable from other companies is that it’s looking at far finer-grain detail from its EEG data.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="MyWaves" data-uuid="6a5c70c7-2b45-4ad2-ab44-94cadc3beb6f"/><figcaption>MyWaves</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There are plenty of companies at CES that are using EEGs for more specific goals, such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://mywaves.tech/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">MyWaves</a>. It uses an EEG as part of its broader offering to use sound patterns to make it easier to go to sleep. It sells you a pricey forehead-worn EEG which you wear for a few nights over the course of a year. From there, the system produces a half hour audio file that will mirror the pattern of your delta brainwaves. It claims that, if you listen to the track before you go to bed, the experience of hearing your delta waves will help you fall asleep faster and experience more REM sleep.</p><p>And there are plenty of companies which are building EEGs for you to wear to keep an eye on your mental health. Brain-Life, for instance, showed off an early prototype of Focus+, a headband EEG with a companion app that can offer feedback on your cognitive load. It can also tell you how long you can sustain your attention and how well your mind relaxes and recovers. The company didn’t have details on when the hardware would be available or how much it cost, as it’s still early days.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="BrainEULink." data-uuid="e4c2dc73-4c20-444b-a63b-57fe79c0cfac"/><figcaption>BrainEULink.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There is broad potential to use an EEG as a brain computer interface, such as the one worked on by Braineulink. That company has combined an EEG with an AR headset to enable people to interact with the world just with their brains. For instance, in a demonstration in the show floor at CES, I was able to turn a light on and off by “focusing” on it, although it’s hard to know how useful that would be in, for instance, creating an assistive device for folks with limited mobility. Like Brain-Life, it’s early days, and so there’s no product that we can point to, but it’s clear we’re going to see more startups looking to enter this world.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="Brain-Life" data-uuid="8e00a0f7-f339-4ff2-b4f3-d7715ddd928b"/><figcaption>Brain-Life</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>As EEGs become more commonplace, it’s likely they’ll be packaged in smaller devices which fit more seamlessly into our lives. One such example is NAOX, a French startup which has built a wearable, clinical-grade EEG into a pair of earbuds for the sort of longitudinal testing required to diagnose conditions like epilepsy. But the company is also planning on incorporating the technology into a pair of true wireless earbuds.These headphones won’t be arriving until the end of 2026, but Naox says the tech is small enough that it can be integrated with other companies earbuds. Consequently, it’s certainly plausible we could see plenty of earbuds that will keep an eye on our brain health as a side hustle.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="Naox" data-uuid="09b9102c-62ab-4c72-8f85-cd0bfd2d0408"/><figcaption>Naox</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>NAOX was co-founded by Dr. Michel Le Van Quyen who, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKhpC2qijQA" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">at a talk in London in December 2025</a>, talked about the rationale for creating an in-ear ECG. Essentially, he was looking to build a brain equivalent to the Apple Watch’s continuous heart rate monitoring (and ECG). I was curious about the science behind an ear-mounted EEG given they commonly use the scalp. Professor Friston said that an ear-mounted EEG is potentially more useful as “you can get slightly closer to the sources of activity.” And that it makes a lot of sense for a consumer-grade EEG to be added to wireless earbuds given their utility in practices like meditation.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors." data-uuid="57ea4c48-a263-4b21-a655-64e6ccbeafcd"/><figcaption>Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>One downside of the proliferation of wearable EEGs is that it could lead users to jump to the wrong conclusions about their mental health. For instance, if someone is to be diagnosed with a condition such as epilepsy, they need to undergo a 24-hour perambulatory EEG. As Professor Friston explained, the recording of that 24 hour EEG would be “carefully scrutinized by experts who are able to run a differential diagnosis ... to specify what further investigations are required.” He, like a lot of clinicians, is concerned about ill-informed consumers using these devices to make medical interventions without consulting a professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Friston added that people shouldn’t expect wearable EEGs to be magic bullets for their brain health or cognition. He said the best way for a consumer to approach them is by treating them with the same level of reverence as a household thermometer. “Are thermometers useful in managing the wellness of my children?, Yes,” he explained, “can your thermometer tell you what particular virus you have? Absolutely not.” “In the context of well-being and to augment or validate practices such as mindfulness and meditation, they can be fun and useful quantitative devices.” But, fundamentally, that is all he feels they can be, especially right now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ces-companies-hoping-your-brain-is-the-next-big-thing-in-computing-175048601.html?src=rss]]></description>

But this year in particular seemed to be a landmark year for robotics. The advancement in AI technology has not only given robots better “brains,” it’s enabled new levels of autonomy and given rise to an ambitious, if sometimes questionable, vision for our robot-filled future.</p><p>From sassy humanoids to AI-powered pets and chore-handling assistants, we sought out as many cute, strange and capable robots as we could find in Las Vegas.

The company was showing off two models: the larger A2 and the smaller X2 (pictured above).

For parents of small children who are constantly leaving their toys around, it would be pretty convenient to have a tiny robot picking up after them. Also for me, who doesn&#39;t have children but a very sweet and hardworking cat who loves to steal socks and then deliver them as if they&#39;re her kills, leaving socks scattered all over the house.

Like a lot of AI companion devices we saw at CES, it’s  equipped with a small camera and microphone that enables it to constantly interact with you. The camera also enables its “memory” so the pet can recognize and deliver personalized updates to its person. Poketomo launched recently in Japan, but sadly Sharp says it has no current plans to sell it in other markets. — <em>KB</em></p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnM1eoi4vXo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><h2 id="jump-link-bibo">Bibo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1014.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1014.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A Labubu-like AI toy with brown fur and big eyes and wearing a gray sweater " data-uuid="e114caf3-9a5c-423a-aae2-03331a233275"><figcaption>Moony bibo (I-Type).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p>It seemed like everyone was trying to cash in on Labubu hype at CES 2026.

But Onero also seemed much more realistic in terms of the type of robot helpers that people might actually see outside of CES, and the company told us it does plan to sell Onero (albeit in limited quantities) by the end of the year.&nbsp; — <em>KB</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-cocomo">Cocomo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cocomo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cocomo.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="An orange, egg-shaped robot with a black face hearts in its eyes sitting on a wheeled base." data-uuid="0e386e9e-f5d4-49c2-8f57-2727707dba07"><figcaption>Ludens AI Cocomo robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p>Another robot pet that won us over immediately <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/japanese-startup-ludens-ai-brought-two-very-adorable-robots-to-ces-2026-021914130.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">was Cocomo</a>. Created by Japanese startup Ludens AI, Cocomo is an autonomous robot friend that yes, uses AI to respond to voice and touch and is meant to bond with its owners over time. The egg-shaped creature can scoot around on a wheeled base, or you can carry it around with you.&nbsp;</p><p>But what we loved about Cocomo is that it&#39;s not trying to be yet another AI assistant, give out life advice or perform tasks. Its goal is to provide companionship and well, be your friend. And while it can respond to voice input it doesn&#39;t exactly have a voice of its own: it communicates via cute humming sounds, which is a lot less creepy than some of the talking robots we saw. — <em>KB</em>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-yonbo">Yonbo&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_0911.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_0911.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="Yonbo AI companion, a children&#39;s dog-like robot, pictured at CES Unveiled" data-uuid="fe3228d7-5891-4c66-81b3-dc65cecec22d"><figcaption>Yonbo at CES.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://yonbo.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">Yonbo</a> is a kids&#39; AI companion robot that totally charmed us. It kind of looks like a dog, and when we visited its booth at Unveiled, there were four of them playfully bopping their heads to a pop song and cycling through different cute facial expressions and emoji eyes (including bowls of ramen). It&#39;s designed to be an intelligent playmate that can tag along for activities, talk with a child and read them stories, and even help them work through emotions, like getting frustrated during a game.&nbsp;</p><p>Yonbo&#39;s movement is controlled by a wristband, so it doesn&#39;t require a phone to play with. It can also be used as an extra pair of eyes for parents around the house. In Parental Monitor mode, which the team says is the only time its camera will be able to stream and store video, parents are able to see what Yonbo sees. The robot costs $800 and is available now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>— CM</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-mofo">MÖFO</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1031.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_1031.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="will.i.am&#39;s latest tech product, MOFO pictured at CES.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2024, NASA announced that the Artemis 2 mission was going to be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-artemis-ii-moon-mission-to-april-2026-224108612.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">pushed back</a> to April 2026. Now, the agency says it could launch as early as February, with the first flight opportunity being on February 6. NASA is currently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/artemis-2/final-steps-underway-for-nasas-first-crewed-artemis-moon-mission/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">making the final preparations</a> for the mission and will soon roll out the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft to their launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The spacecraft system’s four-mile journey from the assembly building to Launch Pad 39B will take up to 12 hours. NASA is targeting a date no earlier than January 17, with the exact day depending on the weather and on the possible need for additional time to address technical issues. </p><p>Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January. The agency will load cryogenic propellants into the rocket and will do a full launch countdown during the rehearsal to prepare for the real event. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-makes-final-preparations-for-its-first-crewed-moon-mission-in-over-50-years-150000825.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chances are that you&#39;re here because you&#39;ve heard a virtual private network (VPN) can change your virtual location, and want to know what that means. If you know already, head over to my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPN</a> list to learn which services I recommend for changing your location. But if you&#39;re clueless, read on.</p><p>Whenever any device connects to the internet — whether it&#39;s a laptop, a phone or a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">smart Lego brick</a> — it&#39;s assigned a unique IP address that other devices can use to identify it. Think of the name you give the barista at a coffee shop, except instead of a hot beverage, you’re being served websites and digital audio and video.</p><p>That&#39;s the upside. The downside is that a device&#39;s IP address can be used to find its location in the real world. That means service providers can show you local weather reports — as well as targeted local ads. More ominously, however, it means service providers can restrict what you see online based on where you are physically. That impacts everything from the fun (what Netflix has available to stream) to the serious (what information gets censored on the government&#39;s behalf).</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">A VPN gets around that downside</a> by running all your online activity through a middleman server before sending it to its destination. Instead of your real IP address, everyone sees the address of the VPN server, along with its geolocation. That means you can subvert any local restrictions getting in your way: You’re actually in Houston, but so far as the website you’re viewing is concerned, you seem to be coming from Amsterdam. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-change-your-virtual-location-with-a-vpn"><strong>How to change your virtual location with a VPN</strong></h2><p>With so many excellent commercial VPNs on the market, changing your virtual location is a lot easier than it sounds. You don&#39;t need to be a hacker — just find a good VPN app and connect to a server in your desired location. On almost any VPN, this is a simple matter of opening the app or desktop client and choosing the server location from a list.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png" style="height:1872px;width:3407px;" alt="On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left." data-uuid="c0ecfb77-d3b2-4d75-b95e-1db966e6c94e"/><figcaption>On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>However, as with any technology, there are some potential pitfalls. For reference, I&#39;ve laid out the steps below for both desktop and mobile devices.</p><h3 id="jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-windows-or-mac"><strong>How to change location on Windows or Mac</strong></h3><p>Use these steps to change the virtual location of any desktop or laptop device running macOS or Windows. There may be slight variations, but in general, this process works for any top VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Select a VPN provider. You can rely on Engadget&#39;s best VPN list or, if you&#39;re unable to pay for a new subscription right now, our list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">best free VPNs</a>. My personal choice is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>, but there are other good options. Look for a service with fast speeds, modern encryption and a long, non-controversial record in the industry.</p></li><li><p>Create an account with the VPN and save your username and password. Unless it&#39;s a forever-free service, this is when you&#39;ll be asked to pay for a subscription. If you&#39;re sure about your provider, you can save a lot by going with a long-term deal. See our list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">best VPN deals</a> for ideas.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN app. It&#39;s best to go through the VPN&#39;s website, even if you&#39;re on Mac — in rare cases, the App Store versions can be outdated or short on features. Look for a download center on the site, and make sure you enter it while logged in.</p></li><li><p>Install the VPN app. Most VPNs have an installation flow built in, so all you have to do is follow the steps. If the VPN asks you to change your settings or grant it permissions, do it; this installs the tools it needs to do its job.</p></li><li><p>Open the VPN app and find your way around the user interface. At a minimum, make sure you know how to connect, disconnect and open the location selection menu.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in the location where you want your internet connection to appear to originate. If you&#39;re trying to get around local restrictions, you can just pick any nearby country without that censorship — for example, if you&#39;re in China, then Japan, South Korea or Singapore will work. If you&#39;re after content from a specific country, choose a server in that country.</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or connected app as you normally would. To make sure your location has actually changed, use a site like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">WhatIsMyIPAddress</a> to check where you&#39;re coming from.</p></li><li><p>When you want to use your real location again, disconnect from the VPN or choose a server in the county you&#39;re in.</p></li></ol><p>It&#39;s not necessary, but I also recommend activating your VPN&#39;s kill switch if there is one. VPN servers aren&#39;t perfect, and they do drop connections from time to time. If this happens, an active kill switch also cuts off your internet connection so your real location isn&#39;t visible for a millisecond.</p><h3 id="jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-iphone-or-android"><strong>How to change location on iPhone or Android</strong></h3><p>The process for using a VPN to change your virtual location on mobile is pretty similar to how it&#39;s done on desktop. Again, while individual installation flows have their own quirks, the following steps are broadly applicable to any iOS or Android VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Pick a VPN provider you like. The best VPNs also tend to be the best for mobile, including Proton VPN, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Surfshark</a>. On mobile, you can use app store reviews and comments to research. Make sure you&#39;re getting the real version of your chosen VPN and not a similarly named one trying to piggyback.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. At this point, if you haven&#39;t paid yet, you may be able to take advantage of a free trial by opening the app and proceeding through the setup flow. This is a good time to test if the VPN is changing your location in ways that can&#39;t be seen through.</p></li><li><p>Follow the VPN&#39;s instructions to create an account, including paying for a subscription if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Take some time to learn to use the VPN app. Mobile interfaces have to pack more features into a smaller space, usually relying on tabs. Try and find the tabs for picking server locations and toggling VPN settings.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in your desired location. Make sure the VPN is actually active before you proceed (most of them make it pretty clear, but it&#39;s still easy to forget).</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or another internet-capable app.</p></li><li><p>When you&#39;re finished, disconnect from the VPN to return to using your real location.</p></li></ol><p>One more note: on both mobile and desktop, I recommend using either a paid VPN or a free VPN supported by a paid subscription. Entirely free VPNs <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">come with risks</a>, and some popular apps <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">secretly share problematic connections</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-why-change-your-virtual-location"><strong>Why change your virtual location?</strong></h2><p>Changing your virtual location isn&#39;t hard, but it&#39;s still an extra step between you and the internet. However, the benefits of location masking far outweigh the small amount of extra work. Hiding your IP address — and your location along with it — is one of the most impactful <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">steps you can take to stay safe online</a>.</p><p>Concealing your IP address has massive benefits on its own, even if you use one close to your real location (which gets you shorter loading times). Lots of web services track you without your consent, frequently for advertising purposes. Some of this is done through third-party cookies, but a lot of it starts with building profiles about your IP address.</p><p>Illicit actors can also take advantage of your IP address and its geolocation. A hacker can track you down to within your ZIP code — though an IP address can&#39;t pinpoint your location to the square foot, it makes it much easier to narrow down where you live. Even with just your IP address, hackers can launch DDoS attacks against you, use the IP to make fake social media accounts in your name or even call in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/miffed-rainbow-six-seige-player-sentenced-for-swatting-ubisoft-montreals-offices-201200746.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">SWAT teams to your location</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ExpressVPN_Netflix_UK.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ExpressVPN_Netflix_UK.png" style="height:1537px;width:3038px;" alt="By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren&#39;t listed in the US." data-uuid="6448824f-e64b-4d18-8249-23db20dc5ddd"/><figcaption>By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren&#39;t listed in the US.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Although masking your virtual location can be vital to staying safe online, there are other practical and even fun reasons to do it. For one thing, when traveling abroad, you might want to use a site only available in your home country. Simply connect to a server located near home and you can use your bank account and local streaming libraries as normal.</p><p>If you&#39;re home, there are lots of benefits to being virtually in another region. You can see a foreign country&#39;s streaming libraries and shop for deals that may only be available in its currency. You can also get around any nationwide online censorship and potentially download banned apps. Just be sure to be aware of your local laws to know if doing so is merely frowned upon, or if it’s truly against the law.</p><h2 id="jump-link-can-a-vpn-change-your-gps-location"><strong>Can a VPN change your GPS location?</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s one more critical point to remember when changing location with a VPN. The VPN server only changes your IP address and the physical location associated with it. It does not change the GPS location your device might be broadcasting.</p><p>GPS data can leak out in a few ways. Tablets and phones have location services turned on by default, and as anyone who&#39;s heard a true crime podcast knows, they can also give away your location by contacting cell towers. Web browsers often have similar features. Websites can also use HTML5 geolocation to access your GPS — provided you give permission, but that&#39;s easy to do without thinking.</p><p>Some VPNs, including Surfshark and Windscribe, do have features designed to fool GPS, but they&#39;re not standard. When you&#39;re changing your location with a VPN, make sure to turn off location services and avoid granting any permissions that might reveal where you really are. You can also run a separate GPS spoofing app alongside your VPN.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-troubleshoot-a-vpn-thats-not-changing-your-location"><strong>How to troubleshoot a VPN that&#39;s not changing your location</strong></h2><p>If you&#39;ve found that browsers are still seeing your old IP address while you have a VPN active, or that websites show you the same content when you&#39;re supposed to be virtually abroad, there&#39;s a chance your VPN isn&#39;t actually changing your location. To test if your real position is leaking, start by checking your IP address (with a search engine or WhatIsMyIPAddress). If it matches your home location, something has gone wrong.</p><p>Note that it&#39;s not necessarily a problem if it doesn&#39;t match your home location or the stated location of your VPN server. VPNs use virtual server locations to reach a lot of locations where brick-and-mortar servers aren&#39;t practical — Windscribe, for example, does not have a physical data center in Antarctica.</p><p>If you find that your VPN is leaking your real IP address, try these troubleshooting steps in order. I&#39;ve arranged them roughly from least to most time-intensive.</p><ol><li><p>Disconnect from your VPN and reconnect to the same location. This should hook you up with a different server in that same place. Test your IP again — there&#39;s a good chance the problem was isolated to the first server you tried.</p></li><li><p>Try a new location (skip this step if you need a server in a particular country).</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN protocol. If you&#39;re using WireGuard, switch to OpenVPN or IKEv2.</p></li><li><p>Make sure location services are turned off.</p></li><li><p>Clear your browser cache and cookies to get rid of any saved information.</p></li><li><p>Test for DNS leaks. Your VPN might accidentally be sending your IP address to a public server to resolve DNS requests. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://IPleak.org" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">IPleak.org</a></a> is a good tool for catching this.</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN. Use a free service like Proton or Windscribe and test for leaks. If the problem reoccurs, it might be coming from inside your network.</p></li><li><p>Contact the helpdesk for your original VPN and inform them about the problem. Get screenshots of the VPN connected to the leaky location next to IP address data confirming the leak.</p></li></ol><p>I&#39;ve already mentioned several VPNs that do a good job of changing your location, but in case you&#39;re here for product advice, here are all my recommendations in one place. My favorite VPN is <strong>Proton VPN,</strong> which is so far the only service to receive full marks on my location-change test. I used 15 of its servers in five different countries to access Netflix. Each time, I saw the destination country&#39;s full content library like I was really there.</p><p><strong>Surfshark </strong>is a close runner-up in this category. It passed 14 out of 15 tests, only slipping up once in Japan — and a quick disconnect and reconnect was enough to fix that. I got equally great results from <strong>ExpressVPN</strong>, only having to retry one server in the UK. <strong>NordVPN </strong>performed perfectly in every location except Nigeria, and that still didn&#39;t leak my real IP address. The problem only seemed to exist on Netflix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-bring-space-station-astronauts-home-early-medical-issue-rcna253077" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">decided</a> to bring the Crew-11 astronauts home a month earlier than originally planned due to a “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/in-a-first-nasa-orders-astronauts-home-after-unspecified-medical-issue/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">medical concern</a>” with one of them. This is the first time in its history that the space agency is cutting a mission short due to a medical issue, but it didn’t identify the crew member or divulge the exact situation and its severity. The agency is targeting a return date no earlier than January 14, with the exact schedule depending on the weather. If NASA’s original plan pushes through, the crew will splash down off the coast of California at approximately 3:40 AM on January 15.</p><p>The agency previously <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-spacewalk-due-to-a-medical-concern-with-a-crew-member-171900024.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">postponed</a> an International Space Station (ISS) spacewalk scheduled for January 8, citing a medical concern with a crew member that appeared the day before. NASA’s chief health and medical officer, James “JD” Polk, said the affected astronaut is “absolutely stable” and that this isn’t a case of an emergency evacuation. The ISS has a “robust suite of medical hardware” onboard, he said, but not enough for a complete workup to determine a diagnosis. Without a proper diagnosis, NASA doesn’t know if the astronaut’s health could be negatively affected by the environment aboard the ISS. That is why the agency is erring on the side of caution. </p><p>Crew-11 left for the space station on August 1 and was supposed to come back to Earth on or around February 20. After they leave the station, only three people will remain: Two cosmonauts and one astronauts who’ll be in charge of all the experiments currently being conducted on the orbiting lab. The team’s replacement, Crew-12, was supposed to head to the ISS mid-February, but NASA is considering sending the astronauts to the station earlier than that. </p><p><strong>Update, January 10, 2025, 5:15AM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to include Crew-11’s tentative return date.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="slk:was out in full force;cpos:1;pos:1">was out in full force</a> covering the show.  The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.</p><p>More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It&#39;s appropriate, I guess, that as we&#39;re beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI&#39;s supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.</p><p>We&#39;re by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it&#39;s fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA&#39;s marathon keynote and Lenovo&#39;s somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it&#39;s been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weird new gadgets</a>, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.</p><p>Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites.

The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It&#39;s portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.</p><p>This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful.

They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego&#39;s Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter, and you&#39;ll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing.

But of all the concepts we saw this year at CES, the Legion Pro Rollable is the one we hope survives to become a proper retail product someday. — <em>Sam Rutherford, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-emerging-technology-ixi-autofocus-lenses">Best emerging technology: IXI autofocus lenses</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_ixi.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_ixi.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="IXI Autofocus lenses" data-uuid="4845f752-034a-4130-a369-9b9b8c549c49" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>IXI Autofocus lenses</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IXI</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">IXI’s autofocusing glasses</a> were a late addition to our discussions, but we were impressed by what could be a significant advancement in spectacle technology — something that’s been largely static since the 1950s. IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user&#39;s eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds.&nbsp;Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription.&nbsp;Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.</p><p>IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe. The company has a busy year ahead as it turns its technology into a consumer product. — <em>Mat Smith, UK bureau chief</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-in-show-lego-smart-play">Best in show: Lego Smart Play</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lego.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lego.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Lego Smart Play" data-uuid="73740191-0c4a-47aa-b5fe-51e126aebd51" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>Lego Smart Play</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lego</div></figure><p>There&#39;s perhaps no place better than CES to highlight how quickly industry trends die. Over the years the show has been a driver of cornerstone technologies like the VCR, DVD, flatscreen TVs, PDAs and more. Some trends stick, some don&#39;t.</p><p>Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product: The company&#39;s core concept of creative play has remained in place throughout its long history, boosted by a gradual and ongoing evolution of block types and brand tie-ins.</p><p>Announced at its first-ever CES press conference, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1">Smart Play</a> represents a thoughtful integration of technology to the classic toy. A tiny chip the size of a single Lego stud allows the company&#39;s Smart Bricks to sense what&#39;s around them, opening up new ways to play. The system will debut with a trio of Star Wars sets, but we’re sure Lego has plans for a wide range of licensed and unlicensed options.</p><p>Our team instantly fell in love with Smart Play, and Deputy editor Nathan Ingraham had the opportunity to both build some sets and talk with some of the people behind the technology. Amid parental anxieties about screentime, it&#39;s refreshing that Smart Play doesn&#39;t require an app or a screen to get started. Kids can just get building. — <em>Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new year is the perfect time to get your spending in order, and if you&#39;re not trying to build your own spreadsheet, budgeting apps are one of the best ways to do it. To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/"><ins>Monarch Money</ins></a>, one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html"><ins>Engadget&#39;s favorite budgeting apps</ins></a>, for just $50 if you use code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout and you&#39;re a new subscriber. That&#39;s a 50 percent discount on the service&#39;s normal $100 price.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re wrapping up coverage of the biggest tech show in the world. CES 2026 is almost over, and while we have more stories and wrap-ups to come, here are the most interesting products we’ve spotted, written about and critiqued/praised. That includes our picks for the best of CES. We gave out 15 awards as well as our best of show, and you might be surprised by some of our picks — I know I was.</p>
<p>Read on for some of the best things to come out of Las Vegas this week, but first up, our Best of the Best winner, which was Lego Smart Play. As Engadget’s editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris put it, “Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product.”</p>
<p>Regardless of trends, Lego has always persisted. And in 2026, it’s getting much smarter.</p>

<p>The system consists of a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html">Smart Brick, Tags and Minifigure</a>s. They’re packed with modern technology, so they can respond to how you play with them or the sets you build. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip, which Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html"><ins>right here</ins></a>), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing.</p>

<p>On Monday, which feels like an age ago, Jensen Huang shared the latest from NVIDIA. While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says can drive more like a human.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>

If you wanted to find a robotic lawn mower, throw a rock. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Humanoid robots</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lockins-everlasting-vein-recognizing-smart-lock-doorbell-cam-combo-is-peak-ces-013431113.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">smart locks</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">super thin TVs</a> were everywhere. But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. </p><p>Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths. This year, there were 38, but that’s in part due to the combination of the energy and sustainability categories. So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. </p><p>Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-withdraws-from-dozens-of-international-bodies-including-climate-focused-organizations-195259578.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">multitude of problems</a> the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. </p><p>But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">best of CES</a> status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. </p><p>Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas. And gosh darn it, at least these guys are trying.   </p><h2 id="jump-link-shine-turbine-20">Shine Turbine 2.0</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/shine_turbine_7698.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/shine_turbine_7698.gif" style="height:730px;width:1374px;" alt="Spinning the Shine Turbine 2.0" data-uuid="a9e3d7a2-9b3f-4624-bba6-1700093ac050"><figcaption>Spinning the Shine 2.0 wind turbine</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>This little guy could be a precursor to some serious personal wind power generation.

And I thought, like paper-wrapped batteries? Nope. The chemicals inside the batteries are made from cellulose. They have a solvent-free, lithium-free, PFAS-free  chemistry and break down by 70 percent in four weeks in a composting environment. They use the same basic architecture as a lithium-ion cell, with an anode, cathode and separator with ion transfers between the two. As of now, Flint is focused on partnering with manufacturers, and consumer products are on the horizon. </p><p>Learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flintlabs.com/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Flint</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-clear-drop-soft-plastics-compactor">Clear Drop soft plastics compactor</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/clear_drop_cpc.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/clear_drop_cpc.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="The Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces." data-uuid="cba4b76b-6a1d-4b19-9057-6c891d31cefb"><figcaption>The Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Clear Drop is a soft plastics compactor that creates eight by twelve by four-inch bricks out of hundreds of grocery bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks and plastic packaging. One brick is equivalent to a 30-pound trash bag-worth of bags. Once the brick is created, it can be shipped to one of Clear Drop’s partner facilities in a pre-paid USPS shipping envelope.

This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems. HydroVigor is currently in use in many buildings in Singapore and Hong Kong and they’re working to expand to more buildings globally. </p><p>Learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.green-vigor.com/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">GreenVigor</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-jackery-solar-gazebo">Jackery Solar Gazebo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jackery_gazebo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jackery_gazebo.jpg" style="height:1463px;width:2600px;" alt="Jackery&#39;s Solar Gazebo.

It’s a modular design that lets you choose louvered walls, sunshades, lights and fans when you order it and the solar panels are so strong that a full-sized human Jackery rep was able to stand on a sample panel in front of me and nothing cracked (though the company officially rates it at 20 pounds of snow per square foot). You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. </p><p>Learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8da55429-10fd-4eee-82eb-d6c6521942a5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5d60aade-77de-4a76-affd-d89b1ce8308b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=jackery&amp;linkText=Jackery&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWNrZXJ5LmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVkNjBhYWRlLTc3ZGUtNGE3Ni1hZmZkLWQ4OWIxY2U4MzA4YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamFja2VyeS5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATTeES63DooitJp1bcNsKSjdj5qb_cSlWYTlEEyRdBvG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jackery.com%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:jackery;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.jackery.com/">Jackery</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-bluetti-rv-solar-system">Bluetti RV Solar System</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bluetti_power.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bluetti_power.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Bluetti&#39;s DIY RV Solar power system" data-uuid="dcf4a9c3-8640-47d7-b562-40d2b912e8e4"><figcaption>Bluetti&#39;s DIY RV Solar power system</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Bluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dell&#39;s XPS 14 now costs over $2,000. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.</p><p>Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months</a>, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung&#39;s marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-warns-of-price-hikes-as-rising-memory-costs-affect-all" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">told Bloomberg</a> at CES: &quot;There&#39;s going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it&#39;s going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.&quot;</p><p>Dell&#39;s new XPS 14 and XPS 16 are among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year&#39;s models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. But Dell later announced a shocking price jump: The XPS 14 now starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. </p><p>While it didn&#39;t take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000, it&#39;s genuinely wild to me that the entry-level models are already starting there. And meanwhile, Apple still hasn&#39;t budged its $1,599  MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.</p><p>On the desktop front, AMD&#39;s David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company&#39;s AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.</p><p>&quot;I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,&quot; he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. &quot;Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there&#39;s a pretty big boost there.&quot;</p><p>McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD&#39;s business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no product that has memory in it that&#39;s immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it&#39;s doing to the market,&quot; he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. &quot;I think the, the truth is the volatility that we&#39;ve seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.&quot; </p><p>Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn&#39;t discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD&#39;s X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don&#39;t see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.</p><p>That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. </p><p>And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/#:~:text=Table_title:%20From%20NVIDIA%20Grace%20to%20Vera%E2%80%94scaling%20the,CPU:%20900GB/s%20%7C%20Vera%20CPU:%201.8TB/s%20%7C" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Vera Rubin AI supercomputer</a>, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2026/from-ces-2026-to-yottaflops-why-the-amd-keynote.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">new Helios AI rack</a>, which supports up to  31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.</p><p>Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.  </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clicks is an apologetically gadgety company, making gear that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/clicks-hands-on-a-charming-keyboard-for-2024-thats-relying-on-more-than-just-nostalgia-131537619.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">feels charmingly out-of-place</a> in a world where almost every smartphone out there is an all-screen slab. That was obviously two years ago when the company first revealed its keyboard case that brought tactile typing to the iPhone and eventually other Android devices. Rather than that being a one-off curiosity, the company had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">two new announcements</a> at CES 2026: a magnetic keyboard accessory that also doubles as a battery bank and small, squat mobile phone with a keyboard. And while there isn’t a working prototype of the Clicks Communicator available for the press to see, I got to check out the new Power Keyboard talk with Clicks co-founder and former BlackBerry marketing director Jeff Gadway about where he thinks his products fit into the smartphone world.</p><p>At first glance, the $79 Power Keyboard feels like a big improvement over the original Clicks Keyboard case. It magnetically attaches to any phone with Qi2 and connects over Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is similar to the original Clicks keyboard, but there’s a dedicated number row which is a nice improvement. But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard." data-uuid="0ce88f11-8353-414f-af2a-31e90ceac187"><figcaption>The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached." data-uuid="d7e2775d-42b4-4516-ab1c-fc8d809e1e93"><figcaption>The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.</p><p>The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. </p><p>“You&#39;ve got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you&#39;ve got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there&#39;s a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You&#39;ve got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you&#39;ve got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications." data-uuid="383d6067-92af-4f84-ac04-08018df735a3"><figcaption>The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn&#39;t your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”</p><p>That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b747fd19-ae32-4fad-ae62-84f9d8942106&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+Niagara+Android+launcher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Yml0cGl0LmxhdW5jaGVyJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNzQ3ZmQxOS1hZTMyLTRmYWQtYWU2Mi04NGY5ZDg5NDIxMDYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1iaXRwaXQubGF1bmNoZXImaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVzMyKyse3TDKidO_Oy2Ej2eR8LRmly8IFYzm1Y2whhd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dbitpit.launcher%26hl%3Den_US" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;hl=en_US">the Niagara Android launcher</a>, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we&#39;ve optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it&#39;s not the thing you&#39;re going to reach for to do that. But we&#39;re not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”</p><p>The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-clicks-co-founder-explains-who-its-tiny-communicator-phone-is-for-170000501.html?src=rss]]></description>

The social media giant is partnering with power companies Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo to deliver an expected 6.6 gigawatts of generation to its projects by 2035.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s agreement with TerraPower will fund the development of two new reactors capable of delivering up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032. The deal also gives Meta rights to energy from six other reactors that could deliver an additional 2.1 gigawatts by 2035. All this power would come from TerraPower&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.terrapower.com/natrium/"><ins>&quot;Natrium&quot; reactors</ins></a>, which use sodium instead of water as a coolant.</p>

Meta says the agreement opens the door to the construction of multiple Oklo reactors, which it claims will create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs in Ohio.

<p>Meta’s agreement with Vistra focuses on keeping existing nuclear plants running longer and boosting their output. Through new 20-year deals, Meta will buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of electricity from some of Vistra’s existing plants in Ohio, while also backing added capacity at those sites, plus another in Pennsylvania. Vistra expects the added capacity, totaling 433 megawatts, to come online in the early 2030s.</p>

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in.

The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing set will set you back $160.

The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. </p><p>While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors.

But Engadget senior editor Daniel Cooper found that Eyebot’s findings perfectly matched the prescription he received from a professional last year.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WheelMove.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WheelMove.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground" data-uuid="6de563c8-09a1-48d9-b84b-34979a029fd9"><figcaption>A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p>Accessibility tech is a welcome presence at CES, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html" data-i13n="cpos:141;pos:1">WheelMove</a> looks like it could be useful for many wheelchair users.

It&#39;s said to be capable of understanding the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of people you&#39;re chatting with, which could be beneficial for folks who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent. The Alaye wristband starts at $359. You can pay $637 for a version that includes a one-year subscription. Otherwise, Hapware&#39;s required plan costs $29 per month.</p><p>Smart glasses were present at CES as well. Xreal gave its entry-level One cinema glasses a spec bump <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/xreal-updates-its-entry-level-personal-cinema-glasses-at-ces-140000544.html" data-i13n="cpos:152;pos:1">and a new name</a>. The 1S has brighter, 1200p (up from 1080p) displays, a slightly wider field of view and a lower price — $449 instead of $499. There’s a new power bank/DisplayPort hub that you can use to recharge Xreal glasses and easily hook them up to a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2. The Xreal Neo is $99.

Much of that tech perhaps doesn&#39;t quite fit neatly into the above categories. So let&#39;s jam through some of those announcements in bullet point format:</p><ul><li><p>HP revived an old trend by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/hps-new-eliteboard-made-me-believe-in-keyboard-computers-again-033000022.html" data-i13n="cpos:157;pos:1">stuffing a computer</a> inside a keyboard.</p></li><li><p>We&#39;ve long liked Satechi&#39;s Thunderbolt 4 docking stations around these parts, so you can bet the brand&#39;s first Thunderbolt 5 version will make us sit up and pay attention. With the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/satechi-is-embracing-thunderbolt-5-at-ces-with-a-new-dock-and-cable-170000137.html" data-i13n="slk:Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure;cpos:158;pos:1">Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure</a> and new Pro Cable, Satechi is promising support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. The dock has several other ports and slots, including a headphone jack. You can stuff an 8TB SSD into the $400 CubeDock too.</p></li><li><p>Yukai Engineering&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/yukai-engineerings-latest-gadget-at-ces-is-a-fan-for-babies-000000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:159;pos:1">Baby FuFu</a> is a larger version of the company’s drink-cooling Nekojita FuFu gizmo. It’s a portable fan for babies that hooks onto strollers.</p></li><li><p>Anker&#39;s Eufy showed off a baby bottle washer with built-in water softener to help remove stubborn minerals, sterilization up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and the ability to dry bottles in 40 minutes. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/eufy-just-revealed-a-tech-heavy-baby-bottle-washer-at-ces-160021666.html" data-i13n="cpos:160;pos:1">Bottle Washer S1</a> also offers app control, the capability to clean up to eight bottle sets at once and the option to keep them in a sterile state for up to 72 hours.</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/clear-drop-is-trying-to-do-something-about-all-those-plastic-bags-under-your-sink-140000254.html" data-i13n="slk:Clear Drop;cpos:161;pos:1">Clear Drop</a> can compress soft plastics (such as grocery bags that recycling centers typically don&#39;t accept) into cubes that can be sent off for recycling. It&#39;s a compelling idea, even if the company&#39;s device costs $1,400.</p></li><li><p>It&#39;s always fun to learn about developments in the smart bird feeder space. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/birdbuddys-new-smart-bird-feeder-can-id-birds-by-their-songs-122000692.html" data-i13n="cpos:162;pos:1">Birdbuddy</a> showed off two new models in different sizes, each with HD cameras and mics that can identify birds by their songs. The larger Birdbuddy 2 also has built-in solar panels.</p></li></ul><p>That about does it for all the key news coming out of CES 2026.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/lg-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-companys-world-premiere-event-190159076.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">LG opened CES 2026</a> by outlining its vision to reduce the physical effort and mental burden of life. Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">robot</a> will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.</p><p>There’s obvious reasons for this: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">AI swallowed</a> the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Panther Lake</a> is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">from EVs</a> and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">production lines</a>, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTRC3lOEg8j/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch</a>. At least, I <em>hope</em> they were pretending.</p><p>I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I&#39;ve got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">toilet computers</a>, massage chairs and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu28o7TF8IE" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">scootcases</a> we all need in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-put-a-waifu-in-a-bottle-at-ces-2026-205315908.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Holographic AI waifus</a> that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-the-latest-gadgets-at-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146311.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">AI Labubus</a> operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">tablet on a moveable base</a> that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company&#39;s humanoid may have been the busiest bot at show, autonomously playing ping-pong, dealing blackjack games and taking selfies with passersby. On display wasn&#39;t just the robot and its smarts, but also SharpaWave, a highly dexterous 1:1 scale human hand.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/yMpCKnQY" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>The hand has 22 active degrees of freedom, according to the company, allowing for precise and intricate finger movements. It mirrored my gestures as I wiggled my hand in front of its camera, getting everything mostly right, which was honestly pretty cool. Each fingertip contains a minicamera and over 1,000 tactile pixels so it can pick up objects with the appropriate amount of delicateness for the task at hand, like plucking a playing card from a deck and placing it gently on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharpa&#39;s robot was a pretty good ping-pong player, too. We&#39;ve seen <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-16-omron-forpheus-fifth-generation-table-tennis-robot-ces.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ping-pong robots</a> plenty of times before, but these typically come in the form of a disembodied robotic arm, not one that&#39;s humanoid from the waist up. The company&#39;s products are meant to be general-purpose, with the ability to handle a wide range of jobs, and its humanoid wore a lot of hats at CES to drive the point home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/sharpas-ping-pong-playing-blackjack-dealing-humanoid-is-working-overtime-at-ces-2026-150000488.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker rolled out a bunch of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-unveils-a-new-lineup-of-chargers-and-docks-at-ces-2026-160021195.html">new chargers</a> and other gear at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html">CES 2026</a>, including a cute one that's already on sale. The new Nano charger with smart display, which is an upgrade to the existing Nano charger in Anker's lineup, is on sale for $30 right now while you can pre-order it. That's $10 off the regular MSRP, and shipments will start going out on January 20.</p> 
<p>The 45W charger includes a smart display that shows real-time data like power flow, temperature and charging status. It also features "fun animations to keep things cheerful." Anker says it can recognize what's being charged and automatically adjust certain metrics to ensure a longer battery lifespan.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="1f0c9e1aa28c4e6cb8e2f5b6045a4e14" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.anker.com/products/a121d-45w-usb-c-fast-charger-foldable-plug-compact?variant=46070529228950"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> 
<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout. If that doesn't work, it's <strong>WS24D5XT3DV9</strong>. We haven't gotten a chance to try this one yet, but it looks promising.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-new-anker-45w-nano-charger-with-smart-display-from-ces-is-10-off-already-160707620.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ollobot">OlloBot</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Two OlloBots &#x002014; one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other &#x002014; are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks." data-uuid="7271ae67-acb9-4987-ae67-517ef063f68e"><figcaption>Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>CES loves a companion robot, but <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html" data-i13n="slk:OlloBot;cpos:4;pos:1">OlloBot</a> might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.</p><h2 id="jump-link-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo">ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&amp;#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits." data-uuid="3b80f798-cec6-305a-954f-3f36c7222243"><figcaption>On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&amp;#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect.

It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.</p><h2 id="jump-link-throne-toilet-computer">Throne toilet computer</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet." data-uuid="1b6635a2-cf8b-41f8-9247-68a48520eee5"><figcaption>The Throne device perched on the side of a toilet.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Throne</a> is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.thronescience.com/products/throne-one" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">toilet-mounted computer</a> that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.</p><h2 id="jump-link-vivoo-hygienic-flowpad-smart-menstrual-pad">Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" style="height:698px;width:1280px;" alt="Image of Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad" data-uuid="a782ed2d-1d1b-4b9b-8be4-934943b97f7f"><figcaption>Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivoo</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/vivoos-toilet-computer-keeps-an-eye-on-your-hydration-030000209.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Vivoo</a> looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized.

Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo-thinkbook-xd-rollable">Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid." data-uuid="5ca5fe56-6894-4cd9-8f38-2fd1b5e0de40"><figcaption>With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">ThinkBook XD Rollable</a> is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ohdoki-handy-2-pro">OhDoki Handy 2 Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" style="height:1012px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro" data-uuid="9f025e81-246a-4ff1-810a-6824e6d7216a"><figcaption>Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-handy-2-pro-is-an-overclockable-sex-toy-044456140.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro</a> arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ipolish">iPolish</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">iPolish</a> finally made <em>Total Recall</em> nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger.

It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ge-profile-smart-fridge">GE Profile Smart Fridge</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/GE_Profile_Smart_Fridge_dislplay.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/GE_Profile_Smart_Fridge_dislplay.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Finally!

A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required. The AI bits are mostly there to answer practical questions like “Where’s my water filter?” which is the most convincing argument we’ve heard for putting a voice assistant on a fridge.</p><h2 id="jump-link-loreal-led-eye-mask">L’Oréal LED eye mask</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-6.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-6.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them." data-uuid="fbe72121-50b8-4048-a072-7d3c18032bd2"><figcaption>A pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">L&#39;Oréal </div></figure><p>L’Oréal’s beauty tech lineup includes an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/loreals-ces-2026-beauty-devices-include-a-skin-like-flexible-led-mask-070000576.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">LED eye mask</a> that looks delightfully ridiculous in the best way: ultra-thin, semi-transparent silicone with visible microcircuitry that makes it feel like sci-fi skincare.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dolby may have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-announces-dolby-vision-2-expanding-picture-quality-beyond-hdr-123019504.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced Dolby Vision 2</a> a few months ago, but the company gave the new platform its first big reveal at CES 2026. I got the chance to see the improvements in person for the first time, thanks to a variety of demos and Q&amp;A sessions. Dolby Vision 2 will be available this year, but initially, it will be limited. As such, I’ve compiled the info on where the image engine will be available first, and what’s likely to come next in terms of where and how you can use it. But first, let’s quickly summarize what Dolby Vision 2 will even do for your TV.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-is-dolby-vision-2">What is Dolby Vision 2?</h2><p>Dolby Vision 2 is Dolby’s next-generation image engine that the company announced in September. The new standard will do several things to improve picture quality on your TV, including content recognition that optimizes your TV based on what and where you’re watching. This first element will improve scenes that many viewers complain are too dark, compensate for ambient lighting and apply motion adjustments for live sports and gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Dolby Vision 2 will also deliver new tone mapping for improved color reproduction. I witnessed this first hand in various demos at CES, and this is the biggest difference between the current Dolby Vision and DV2 for me.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also a new Authentic Motion feature that will provide the optimal amount of smoothing so that content appears more “authentically cinematic,” according to Dolby. This means getting rid of unwanted judder, but stopping short of the so-called soap opera effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, Dolby is taking advantage of all of the capabilities of today’s TVs, harnessing the improvements to display quality and processing power that companies have developed in the decade since Dolby Vision first arrived.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-tvs-will-support-dolby-vision-2">What TVs will support Dolby Vision 2?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/X11L-Lifestyle-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/X11L-Lifestyle-1.jpg" style="height:3072px;width:5504px;" alt="Lifestyle photo of the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED Series" data-uuid="550f5cf0-95f7-45bb-bdaa-44c34e0d869d"/><figcaption>Lifestyle photo of the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED Series</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>The biggest Dolby Vision 2 news at CES was the first three TV makers that have pledged support for the new standard. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/hisense-introduces-its-first-ever-consumer-microled-tv-194057452.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Hisense</a> is bringing it to its 2026 RGB MiniLED TVs — including UX, UR9 and UR8. The company also plans to add it to more MiniLED TVs with an OTA update. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/tcl-unveils-its-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tvs-at-ces-2026-205532386.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">TCL&#39;s 2026 X QD-Mini LED TV Series</a> and C Series will support Dolby Vision 2 via a future update. It will be available on TP Vision’s Philips’ 2026 OLED TVs, including the 2026 Philips OLED811, and OLED911 series as well as the flagship OLED951.</p><p>There are sure to be other companies that announce Dolby Vision 2 support in 2026. Sony doesn’t announce its new TVs at CES anymore, so that’s just one of the bigger names that’s yet to reveal its hand.&nbsp;Any upcoming TVs that seek to leverage the full suite of tools that Dolby Vision 2 offers will need to have an ambient light sensor as that’s one of the key facets of Dolby’s upgrade. </p><h2 id="jump-link-what-content-will-be-available-in-dolby-vision-2">What content will be available in Dolby Vision 2?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dolby-vision-atmos.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dolby-vision-atmos.jpg" style="height:900px;width:1600px;" alt="Peacock is bringing Dolby Vision and Atmos support to more live sports offerings." data-uuid="982e3f94-6264-461d-95e2-d1ebaf705d66"/><figcaption>Peacock is bringing Dolby Vision and Atmos support to more live sports offerings.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Peacock</div></figure><p>The other big piece of Dolby Vision 2 news at CES 2026 was the first streaming service that will support the platform. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/peacock-is-expanding-dolby-vision-and-atmos-availability-for-live-sports-023000794.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Peacock grabbed that honor</a>, and so far it’s the only streamer to pledge support. However, several services support the current version of Dolby Vision, including Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and Paramount+. Like the additional TV support that’s sure to be announced throughout the year, I expect more streaming services will jump on board soon as well. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-vision-2-is-coming-this-year-heres-what-you-need-to-know-140000034.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html">best ereaders</a>, and for good reason. It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="feed13a4ff304bf1a5611d4015f6cd38" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>

The eight-inch display feels refreshingly restrained, while integrations with Instacart and recipe suggestions add utility. It launches in March for $4,899, and for once, we’re genuinely curious what it would be like to live with it.</p><h2 id="jump-link-longbow-motors-speedster-ev">Longbow Motors Speedster EV</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Longbow Motors Speedster" data-uuid="221cff0b-9ddd-4c0c-aa68-e34e9222b104"/><figcaption>Longbow Motors Speedster</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ces-2026-longbow-motors-shows-off-its-speedster-ev-with-donut-labs-in-wheel-motors-192329111.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Longbow Motors</a> brought one of the most emotionally compelling EVs we’ve seen to CES, and it’s unapologetically minimalist. The Speedster uses in-wheel motors from Donut Labs to hit a jaw-dropping curb weight of just 2,200 pounds, lighter than a Miata. Its stripped-back interior, mystery shift lever and exposed motors feel like a direct rejection of touchscreen-heavy modern cars. It’s wildly expensive at just under $100,000, but also one of the few EVs here that got us excited to drive.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ollobot-companion-robot">OlloBot companion robot</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ollobot%20CES%202026.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ollobot%20CES%202026.jpg" style="height:853px;width:1280px;" alt="A robot with eyes on top of a screen showing a smile." data-uuid="1dc05124-9b6f-41b9-91da-b9dcb82fa570"/><figcaption>A robot with eyes on top of a screen showing a smile.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">OlloBot</a> might win the award for most charmingly strange robot on the show floor. Designed as a family “cyber pet,” it responds to voice and touch, develops a personality over time and stores all its memories locally in a removable heart-shaped module. The robot can help find lost items, make calls and eventually control Matter smart home devices. A Kickstarter is planned for summer, with pricing starting around $1,000.</p><h2 id="jump-link-bluetti-charger-2">Bluetti Charger 2</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/BLUETTI_Charger_2_-_RV_Solution.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/BLUETTI_Charger_2_-_RV_Solution.jpg" style="height:1918px;width:4096px;" alt="Image demonstrating the setup for Bluetti&#39;s Charger 2" data-uuid="c61c695f-5552-43ef-b7d4-ac79ee560833"/><figcaption>Here&#39;s how the Bluetti Charger 2 would work with dual charging sources.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bluetti</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/bluettis-charger-2-uses-solar-and-engine-power-to-charge-your-portable-battery-230000270.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Bluetti’s Charger 2</a> fixes a very specific but real problem for off-grid users: charging from your engine and solar panels at the same time. The dual-input system supports up to 600W from solar and 800W from an alternator, dramatically speeding up battery top-ups. It also works with multiple Bluetti power stations and can even jump-start your vehicle in a pinch. Early pricing is $349 through February 7, after which it jumps to $499.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ces-is-ending-but-weve-got-more-stories-to-tell">CES is ending, but we’ve got more stories to tell</h2><p>The CES show floor will soon be closing down, but Engadget still has a lot of stories in our pipeline.

You can pick up the smartwatch for $299, which is 25 percent off its regular price, a discount of $100. Discounts tend to increase as we get closer to September, when the next generation of Apple Watch is typically announced.</p>

<p>The Series 11 is our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">best overall smartwatch</a> pick, and we gave it a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html">hands-on review</a>. We were impressed with the battery life, which lasted longer than the 24 hours it&#39;s rated for in our testing. We also liked how lightweight and thin the watch is. The 9.7mm thick case on the Series 11 ties the Series 10 for the thinnest Apple Watch so far.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Fitness and health tracking are the main appeals of an Apple Watch, and the Series 11 introduces sleep tracking and hypertension notifications. The sleep tracking was comfortable thanks to the watch&#39;s small form factor. The watch also added a new wrist flick gesture that lets you dismiss notifications, end calls and silence alarms or timers.</p> 
<p>The GPS + cellular model of the Series 11 is also $100 off, and it&#39;s the first Apple Watch to support 5G networks. It&#39;s not too often you see an Apple product for 25 percent off its retail price, so if you were in the market for a smart watch, and especially if you are an iPhone user, it&#39;s worth checking out.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kia has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.kianewscenter.com/news/all/kia-unveils-ev2-at-brussels-motor-show/s/fea22a3c-6664-463f-87d2-c17de0e5dfb9">unveiled</a> its new entry level electric vehicle, the EV2. The boxy model strongly resembles the company&#39;s Soul (Kia did make an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-2020-kia-soul-ev-first-drive.html">electric Soul</a> at one point) and has very similar dimensions, though it&#39;s slightly shorter in height and length. It&#39;s not exactly a range monster and will charge a bit slower than the competition. The EV2 launched at the Brussels Motor Show and the company said it has no plans for US availability at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EV2 uses Kia/Hyundai&#39;s E-GMP platform and slots into the bottom of its EV lineup as an &quot;entry point to electric mobility,&quot; according to the automaker. Though nearly the same size, it certainly looks nicer than the dowdy Soul and has more room inside. Competition-wise, it&#39;s going up against <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-ex30-first-drive-charming-and-eco-friendly-with-power-to-spare-080039873.html">Volvo&#39;s EX30</a> and may cost about the same, though Kia has yet to divulge pricing.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/e8be2c00-ed4c-11f0-bd7f-fa5d13cf1960" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/e8be2c00-ed4c-11f0-bd7f-fa5d13cf1960" style="height:720px;width:1280px;" alt="Kia&#39;s budget EV2 arrives with up to 240 miles of range" data-uuid="bd7209c9-816f-3a1d-83c6-ac1e53d71295"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kia</div></figure>
<p>The EV2 will be offered with two battery options: a 42kWh battery with 197 miles of WLTP range (likely around 170 miles by EPA standards) and 61kWh with 278 miles of WLPT range (around 240 EPA miles). That&#39;s not a lot, especially compared to the 261 mile EPA max range of the EX30 — so Kia&#39;s pricing for the EV2 will be key. As for charging speeds, Kia says the EV2 will charge from 10 to 80 percent in about 30 minutes — a bit slower than the 69 kWh EX30. Like other Kia vehicles, the EV2 supports vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-load (V2L/V2G) charging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kia calls the vehicle&#39;s interior a &quot;Picnic Box&quot; as a way to describe the small but useful space. Kia says its &quot;comparable to larger vehicles&quot; in terms of space, with generous rear legroom and rear cargo capacity up to 403 liters. It will come in four- and five-seat versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for tech inside, it offers a generous screen setup, with a 12.3-inch instrument cluster, 12.3-inch infotainment screen and a 5-inch climate display. Ambient lighting in the cabin syncs up with specific vehicle functions. At the same time, it offers a fully array of manual controls climate, volume control and more. It comes with multiple USB-C ports (three up front) that support up to 100W charging.</p>
<p>The company has yet to reveal performance figures other than range. Production is set to start in Q1, so deliveries should commence in Europe and other regions later in the year. It doesn&#39;t look like the EV2 will arrive stateside any time soon, though, as the company said it &quot;has not announced plans for the US market.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/kias-budget-ev2-arrives-with-up-to-240-miles-of-range-130038144.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Probably my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">favorite thing</a> about the Lego Smart Play system <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">unveiled this week</a> at CES is that it was designed for kids, first and foremost. In the past 10 years or so, Lego has increasingly courted an older audience with more expensive and elaborate sets. But when it was time to bring more advanced technology to Lego, the idea right from the beginning was more social and interactive play.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t heard about Smart Play yet, its a way for Lego to make its sets more interactive. A Smart Brick filled with sensors makes it so sets can respond to each other, know when they’re moving, play sounds and know when the corresponding Smart Minifigures are near them. Tiny Smart Tags, meanwhile, help the Smart Brick know the context of how it’s being used — whether it’s in a helicopter, car or duck for example. </p><p>Tom Donaldson, senior VP and Head of Creative Play Lab at the LEGO Group, told Engadget that the company worked on Smart Play for about eight years before introducing it this week, and that social play was the starting point. “We started really looking at consumer needs, and this idea that kids really like social play,” said Donaldson “Kids really like the sort of things that change when they come back to them, and the kids really like agency. They want to be able to change things.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/_2DB6431_5eTSELom.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/_2DB6431_5eTSELom.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="Lego&#39;s Tom Donaldson demoing Smart Play at CES." data-uuid="bf8d975a-2afa-4bf7-8808-cb68210e259e"/><figcaption>Lego&#39;s Tom Donaldson demoing Smart Play at CES.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LEGO</div></figure><p>But a big part of the creation process was making the Smart Brick as flexible and powerful as possible and then seeing what scenarios could take advantage of it. “We wanted to build a really powerful platform,”&nbsp; he said. “What we shouldn&#39;t do is say, ‘this is what we think we&#39;re gonna need.’ We needed to say, ‘let&#39;s create something that has a lot of capabilities that we can then figure out how to use.’”</p><p>One of the conflicts with the tech-packed Smart Play system, though, might be the cost. Obviously, Lego has been successful at most ventures it has undertaken in recent years, but the pricing of Smart Play sets could make adoption a bit challenging. The biggest Smart Play set, Star Wars Throne Room Duel &amp; A-Wing, for example, has almost 1,000 pieces and costs $160. That’s quite a bit more than comparably sized sets. The dual factors of the Star Wars license and Smart Play tech certainly impacted the cost.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/75427_Lifestyle_envr.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/75427_Lifestyle_envr.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="Lego Smart Play Star Wars set" data-uuid="b3e317b2-394e-4b38-90c5-575e2c1082c7"/><figcaption>Lego Smart Play Star Wars set</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LEGO</div></figure><p>The set includes two Smart Bricks, five Smart Tags and three Smart Minifigures, the most “smart” gear included in any of the initial three Star Wars Smart Play sets. Will parents shell out for the more advanced capabilities that Smart Play offers, or will they stick with standard sets? </p><p>For now, Lego is betting the extremely broad appeal of Star Wars will help these new Smart Play sets find an audience. About three years ago, Lego got its team focused on the Star Wars franchise involved, as well as Lucasfilm, to figure out how to roll Smart Play out to the world. “Very early on, we all decided that starting with the original trilogy would be great,” said Derek Stothard, Disney’s Director of Global Licensing “These are such well-known scenes and characters, and they cross generations, so parents can introduce them to&nbsp; their kids. All that works really well together.”&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lego is being coy about where things go beyond the initial three Star Wars sets, but it’s clear that after eight years of development, they’ll want to bring it to as many product lines as possible. “We&#39;re announcing a platform that you can see has tremendous growth [potential], Donaldson said. “We made the analogy with the minifigure as something that you’ll see across the entire [Lego] system, maybe not in every single SKU but it’ll reappear in many different places. But ultimately we&#39;re a company that really focuses on giving kids what they want, what they love, and we&#39;ll have to see how it lives in a market.”</p><p>That last point about how it lives in the market is a good one, particularly given the pricing. We probably won’t know for sure until Lego moves beyond the safe confines of Star Wars and really shows us what Smart Play can do across more varied scenarios. And going to non-licensed sets might be where Smart Play really takes off — it’s easy to imagine a cheaper Smart Play add-on kit that can bring sets to life at a lower cost. But the idea of transforming anything kids create into something more interactive has a ton of potential if Lego can broaden its appeal beyond Star Wars fans.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-is-trying-to-make-tech-invisible-with-smart-play-130000979.html?src=rss]]></description>

The advertisements even promised $50,000 signing bonuses for new recruits. Campaigns were launched to urge users to cancel their subscriptions and to boycott the service, and even music labels called on the company to stop serving ICE advertisements. Spotify said back then that the ads don’t violate its policies and that users can simply mark them with a thumbs up or down to let the platform know their preferences. </p><p>The company reportedly received $74,000 from Homeland Security for the ICE ads, but that’s a tiny amount compared to what other companies received. According to a report by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-ads-all-over-streaming-services-spotify-hbo-pandora-1235447970/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Google and YouTube were paid $3 million for Spanish-language ads that called for self-deportation, while Meta received $2.8 million. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-no-longer-running-ads-for-ice-130000672.html?src=rss]]></description>

This time around, Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em> — one of our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">favorite games of last year</a> — is crossing the great divide. The fantasy action RPG will hit Sony’s console <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-is-coming-to-playstation-5" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">on February 17</a>, one day shy of the game’s first anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>As it happens, an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/avowed-updated-roadmap" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">anniversary update</a> is set to go live on all platforms at the same time. This includes a new game+ mode (allowing those who have beaten the RPG to replay it with all their gear and upgrades from their previous run), a photo mode, a new weapon type and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Avowed</em> is set in the same universe as Obsidian’s Pillars of Eternity games. It tasks you with investigating a fungal plague that has infested the world. “The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant,&quot; Engadget senior reporter Jessica Conditt wrote. &quot;<em>Avowed</em> is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft has brought a string of first-party Xbox games to PS5 over the last couple of years, freeing them from console exclusivity. <em>Forza Horizon 5, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade II</em> and <em>Sea of Thieves </em>are among the games that have crossed over to PlayStation.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Old-school, upright vacuums left a lot to be desired, and cordless models are here to right many of those wrongs. These types of vacuums tend to be thinner, lighter and easy to maneuver around a home, and you don’t really have to sacrifice suction power anymore to get those benefits. Dyson isn’t your only option anymore either — like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from today. Variety is great, but it can also lead to decision fatigue and confusion.<br><br>We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the best cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which is the best cordless vacuum for you.</p>

However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money.

I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the &quot;self&quot; part isn&#39;t really there — instead, there&#39;s a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It&#39;s convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well.</p>

But it&#39;s ultimately <em>just fine</em> in comparison to our top picks; it&#39;s not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it&#39;s just awkward) and it doesn&#39;t have the smoothest handling.</p>

The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-cordless-vacuum">Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design-and-bin-capacity">Design and bin capacity</h3> 
<p>Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices.</p> 
<p>Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners.</p> 
<p>Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session.</p> 
<p>If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-suction-and-power-modes">Suction and power modes</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power.</p> 
<p>Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength.</p> 
<p>Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible.</p> 
<p>If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-floor-type">Floor type</h3> 
<p>The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it&#39;s still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life">Battery life</h3> 
<p>Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-base-style">Base style</h3> 
<p>Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby.</p> 
<p>Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-smart-features">“Smart” features</h3> 
<p>Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area.</p> 
<p>Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">best robot vacuums</a>, or even the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">best budget robot vacuums</a>, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t <em>need</em> Wi-Fi or an app connectivity.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-cordless-vacuums">How we test cordless vacuums</h2> 
<p>Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-cordless-stick-vacuums-faqs">Cordless stick vacuums FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-does-the-battery-last-on-a-cordless-vacuum">How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum?</h3> 
<p>Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cordless-vacuums-be-as-powerful-as-corded-ones">Can cordless vacuums be as powerful as corded ones?</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuums do sacrifice a bit in overall power when compared to corded models, but that doesn’t mean they can’t handle everyday messes just as well. If suction power is your biggest concern, we recommend springing for a high-powered, high-end cordless vacuum since, typically, the more expensive a cordless vacuum is, the stronger the suction. Also, cordless vacuums have the edge over corded models when it comes to weight and convenience: cordless vacuums are much lighter than their corded counterparts, and you’ll never have to worry about placement or picking a fight with a cord while cleaning your living room.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-cordless-vacuums-effective-on-pet-hair">Are cordless vacuums effective on pet hair?</h3> 
<p>Yes, cordless vacuums can handle pet hair well, but we recommend getting a model with strong suction power to get the best results. It’s also wise to get one with a larger bin, since pet hair can quickly fill up smaller bins, which may force you to stop cleaning to empty the vacuum before finishing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-methods-for-maintaining-a-cordless-vacuum-cleaner">What are the best methods for maintaining a cordless vacuum cleaner?</h3> 
<p>Maintaining a cordless vacuum is super easy and helps to keep it running like new. First, make sure to empty the dustbin regularly — don’t let it overfill, as this can impact suction. Many models have washable filters, so rinse them out every few weeks (check your manual for specifics) and let them dry completely before putting them back.</p> 
<p>Next, take a look at the brush roll — hair and debris can get tangled up in there over time. Most vacuums make it simple to remove the brush roll, so you can snip away any tangles with scissors. If your vacuum has a replaceable battery, try not to let it fully drain too often, as this can reduce its lifespan. A quick wipe-down of the vacuum’s exterior and attachments will also keep everything looking fresh.</p> 
<p>Lastly, keep an eye on the sensors and charging contacts, as dust can build up there too. A gentle wipe with a dry cloth every now and then will do the trick.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cordless-vacuums-also-be-used-to-clean-curtains-and-upholstery">Can cordless vacuums also be used to clean curtains and upholstery?</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuums are surprisingly versatile, and many come with attachments specifically designed for surfaces like curtains, upholstery and even mattresses. A handheld vacuum mode, which is common in cordless models, makes it easy to tackle these areas. Look for a soft brush or an upholstery tool in the attachments for the vacuum you’re considering — it’ll help remove dust and pet hair without damaging fabrics. For curtains, it’s a good idea to use a lower suction setting if your vacuum has adjustable modes. This prevents the fabric from getting pulled into the nozzle.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lumus got a major boost in brand recognition when one of its waveguides was selected for use in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>. But that already feels like old tech now because at CES 2026, the company brought some of its latest components to the show and based on what I saw, they seem poised to seriously elevate the optical quality of the next wave of high-end smartglasses.&nbsp;</p><p>When the Meta Ray-Ban Displays glasses came out, they wowed users as they were (and still are) one of a handful of smartglassess to feature a full-color in-lens display with at least a 20-degree field of view. But going by the specs on Lumus’ newest waveguides, we’re set for a major upgrade in terms of future capabilities.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-wave-guide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-wave-guide.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses&#39; lenses." data-uuid="7f2fc40a-ee7f-46f3-a0e9-7f2abc7f4bba"/><figcaption>If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses&#39; lenses.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The first model I tried featured Lumus’ optimized Z-30 waveguides, which not only offer a much wider 30-degree FOV, they are also 30 percent lighter and 40 percent thinner than previous generations. On top of that, Lumus says they are also more power efficient with the waveguides capable of hitting more than 8,000 nits per watt. This is a big deal because smartglasses are currently quite limited by the size of batteries they can use, especially if you want to make them small and light enough to wear all day. When I tried them on, I was dazzled by both the brightness and sharpness I saw from the Z-30s despite them being limited to 720 x 720 resolution. Not only did the increase in FOV feel much larger than 10 degrees, colors were very rich, including white, which is often one of the most difficult shades to properly reproduce.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-70-fov-model.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-70-fov-model.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="I had to take a photo of one of Lumus&#39; non-functioning smartglasses with the company&#39;s 70-degree FOV waveguide, because two out of three of the working ones had already broke and the last one that I used was being held together by tape. " data-uuid="2664d562-eec0-44d3-b911-7ef1dc24d8da"/><figcaption>I had to take a photo of one of Lumus&#39; non-functioning smartglasses with the company&#39;s 70-degree FOV waveguide, because two out of three of the working ones had already broke and the last one that I used was being held together by tape. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>However, even after seeing how good that first model was, I was totally not prepared for Lumus’ 70-degree FOV waveguides. I was able to view some videos and a handful of test images and I was completely blown away with how much area they covered. It was basically the entire center portion of the lens, with only small unused areas around the corners. And while I did notice some pincushion distortion along the sides of the waveguide’s display, a Lumus representative told me that it will be possible to correct for that in final retail units. But make no mistake, these waveguides undoubtedly produced some of the sharpest, brightest and best-looking optics I’ve seen from any smartglasses, from either retail models or prototypes or. It almost made me question how much wider FOV these types of gadgets really need, though to be clear, I don’t think we’ve hit the point of diminishing returns yet.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/super-thin-waveguide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/super-thin-waveguide.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="This is one of Lumus&#39; thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm." data-uuid="9340a55b-ea8c-421b-9e82-4fa5b309dd58"/><figcaption>This is one of Lumus&#39; thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Other advantages of Lumus’ geometric reflective waveguides include better overall efficiency than their refractive counterparts along with the ability to optically bond the displays to smartglasses lenses. That means unlike a lot of rivals, Lumus’ waveguides can be paired with transitions lenses instead of needing to resort to clip-on sunglass attachments when you go outside. Lumus also claims its designs also simplifies the manufacturing process, resulting in thinner waveguides (as small as 0.8mm) and generally higher yields.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, taking high-quality photos of content from smartglasses displays is incredibly challenging, especially when you’re using extremely delicate prototypes, so you’ll just have to take my word for now.  But with Lumus in the process of ramping up production of its new waveguides with help from partners including Quanta and SCHOTT, it feels like there will be a ton of smartglasses makers clamoring for these components as momentum continues to build around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the industry’s pick for the next “big” thing.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/lumus-brought-a-massively-wider-fov-to-smartglasses-at-ces-2026-233245949.html?src=rss]]></description>

It wasn&#39;t perfect — it misread a capital &quot;I&quot; as an &quot;H&quot; — but it was surprsingly intuitive. I was able to quickly trace out a short sentence and even correct a typo (a swipe from left to right will let you add a space, while a swipe from right to left deletes the last character).&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ9IsB72nVk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Alongside handwriting, Meta also announced a new teleprompter feature.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While wave upon wave of smartglasses and face-based wearables crash on the shores of CES, traditional glasses really haven’t changed much over the hundreds of years we’ve been using them. The last innovation, arguably, was progressive multifocals that blended near and farsighted lenses — and that was back in the 1950s. It makes sense that autofocusing glasses maker IXI thinks it’s time to modernize glasses.</p>
<p>After recently announcing a 22-gram (0.7-ounce) prototype frame, the startup is here in Las Vegas to show off working prototypes of its lenses, a key component of its autofocus glasses, which could be a game-changer.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IXI’s glasses are designed for age-related farsightedness, a condition that affects many, if not most people over 45. They combine cameraless eye tracking with liquid crystal lenses that automatically activate when the glasses detect the user’s focus shifting. This means that, instead of having two separate prescriptions, as in multifocal or bifocal lenses, IXI’s lenses automatically switch between each prescription. Crucially — like most modern smartglasses — the frames themselves are lightweight and look like just another pair of normal glasses.</p>

<p>With a row of prototype frames and lenses laid out in front of him, CEO and co-founder Niko Eiden explained the technology, which can be separated into two parts. First, the IXI glasses track the movement of your eyes using a system of LEDs and photodiodes, dotted around the edges of where the lenses sit. The LEDs bounce invisible infrared light off the eyes and then measure the reflection, detecting the subtle movements of your eye and how both eyes converge when focusing on something close.</p>
<p>Using infrared with just a &quot;handful of analog channels&quot; takes far less power than the millions of pixels and 60-times-per-second processing required by camera-based systems. IXI’s system not only tracks eye movements, but also blinking and gaze direction, while consuming only 4 milliwatts of power.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12d1bba0-ec27-11f0-bbbc-16c5fed13b32" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12d1bba0-ec27-11f0-bbbc-16c5fed13b32" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="IXI autofocus lenses" data-uuid="c25a9be8-a13b-31aa-84fc-453d028d5a89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Most of the technology, including memory, sensors, driving electronics and eye tracker, is in the front frame of the glasses and part of the arms closest to the hinge. The IXI prototype apparently uses batteries similar in size to those found in AirPods, which gives some sense of the size and weight of the tech being used. The charging port is integrated into the glasses’ left arm hinge. Naturally, this does mean they can’t be worn while charging. IXI says that a single charge should cover a whole day’s usage.</p>
<p>The prototype frames I saw this week appeared to be roughly the same weight as my traditional chunky specs. And while these are early iterations, IXI’s first frames wouldn’t look out of place in a lineup of spectacle options.</p>
<p>The team has also refined the nose pieces and glasses arms to accommodate different face shapes. Apparently, when testing expanded from Finland to the UK, British faces were “...different.” A little harsh when talking to me, a Brit.</p>
<p>Eiden pulled out some prototype lenses, made up of layers of liquid crystal and a transparent ITO (indium tin oxide) conductive layer. This combination is still incredibly thin, and it was amazing to watch the layers switch almost instantly into a prescription lens. It seemed almost magical. As they’re so thin, they can be easily integrated into lenses with existing prescriptions. It can also provide cylindrical correction for astigmatism too.</p>
<p>Autofocus lenses could eliminate the need for multiple pairs of glasses, such as bifocals and progressives. Even if the glasses were to run out of power, they’d still function as a pair of traditional specs with your standard prescription, just lacking the near-sighted boost. IXI’s sensor sensitivity can also offer insight into other health conditions, detect dry eyes, estimate attentiveness and, by tracking where you’re looking, even posture and neck movement. According to Eiden, blink rate changes with focus, daydreaming and anxiety, and all that generates data that can be shown in the companion app.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12da9540-ec27-11f0-87ed-a30e3c5b4845" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12da9540-ec27-11f0-87ed-a30e3c5b4845" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="IXI autofocus lenses" data-uuid="afc56c09-ccc5-3fb2-a787-2915237b51d6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Hypothetically, the product could even potentially adapt prescriptions dynamically, going beyond the simple vision correction of Gen 1. For example, it could offer stronger corrections as your eyes get fatigued through the day.</p>
<p>IXI appears to be putting the pieces in place to make these glasses a reality. It still needs to obtain the necessary medical certifications in order to sell its glasses and get all the production pieces in place. It’s already partnered with Swiss lens-maker Optiswiss for manufacturing. Eiden says the final product will be positioned as a high-end luxury glasses option, selling through existing opticians. The company hopes to finally launch its first pair sometime next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html?src=rss]]></description>

Atlas can work autonomously, via a teleoperator or with &quot;a tablet steering interface,&quot; and the robot is both strong and durable. Boston Dynamics says Atlas has a reach of up to 7.5 feet, the ability to lift 110 pounds and can operate at temperatures ranging from minus 4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. &quot;This is the best robot we have ever built,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said in the Atlas announcement. &quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Boston Dynamics has been publicly demoing its work on humanoid robots since at least 2011, when <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-12-darpa-atlas.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">it first debuted Atlas</a> as a DARPA project.

In 2030, the car maker hopes to have the robot&#39;s responsibilities &quot;extend to component assembly, and over time, Atlas will also take on tasks involving repetitive motions, heavy loads, and other complex operations,&quot; Hyundai says. Google DeepMind, meanwhile, is receiving Atlas robots so it can work on integrating its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepminds-latest-ai-model-can-help-robots-fold-origami-and-close-ziploc-bags-151455249.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Gemini Robotics</a> AI foundation models into Boston Dynamics&#39; system. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html?src=rss]]></description>

You’ll still need to connect it to your computer via USB-C to provide Ava with the power and data it needs. However, all of your companion’s other components are built into its abode, including dual far-field mics so you can talk to it, a down-firing full-range speaker so it can talk and an HD camera with an ambient light sensor so the AI can see and react to its surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTPWLR4Cdkb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style="background:#FFF;border:0;margin:1px;max-width:658px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;"><div style="padding:16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTPWLR4Cdkb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="background:#FFFFFF;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display:flex;"> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:40px;margin-right:14px;width:40px;"></div> <div style="display:flex;"> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;margin-bottom:6px;width:100px;"></div> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;width:60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding:19% 0;"></div> <div style="display:block;height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px;"></div><div style="padding-top:8px;"> <div style="color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding:12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display:flex;margin-bottom:14px;"><div> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;"></div> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;margin-right:14px;margin-left:2px;"></div> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left:8px;"> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:20px;width:20px;"></div> <div style="width:0;height:0;border-top:2px solid transparent;border-left:6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom:2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left:auto;"> <div style="width:0px;border-top:8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right:8px solid transparent;"></div> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12px;width:16px;"></div> <div style="width:0;height:0;border-top:8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left:8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div> <div style="display:flex;margin-bottom:24px;"> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;margin-bottom:6px;width:224px;"></div> <div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;width:144px;"></div></div></a></div></blockquote>
</div><p>But perhaps the biggest upgrade to the project is that instead of just Ava, who Razer describes as “a calm, reliable source of energy to help you keep things clear, efficient, and always on point,” there are three or four new personas (depending on how we’re counting) joining the roster. Kira looks like a TikTok e-girl decked out in a frilly outfit complete with Razer neon green accents, while Zane is her edgy masculine alternative who kind of reminds me of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.meming.world/wiki/Giga_Chad" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Giga Chad meme</a>, but with extra snake tattoos. Then there’s Sao, who appears to be directly inspired by iconic <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/japanese-salarywoman-saori-araki" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Japanese salary woman Saori Araki</a>. Finally, there’s an avatar made in the likeness of Faker (Lee Sang-hyeok), the most successful and well-known League of Legends player of all time and one of Razer&#39;s sponsored esports athletes.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-connected.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-connected.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion." data-uuid="b033651e-b4c3-4f15-970d-0ef496c4dd1e"><figcaption>The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The idea now is that instead of being trapped inside your computer, Ava or one of Razer’s other personas can sit on your desk and be your companion for everything. They can remind you of upcoming events, respond to questions or even comment on your outfit using Razer’s built-in camera. That said, if you need some privacy, the device’s mics can be muted and the company says its planning on putting a physical camera shutter on final retail models. Of course, Ava or any of the other avatars can still hang out while you game and give you advice. During my demo, Kira helped pick out a loadout in <em>Battlefield 6</em>  based on user criteria and even provided pros and cons for some of the game’s other equipment options.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/avatars.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/avatars.png" style="height:633px;width:1507px;" alt="Project Ava&#39;s expanded roster of AI companions" data-uuid="b918f479-ae59-431a-8ce7-833d6d12618b"><figcaption>Project Ava&#39;s expanded roster of AI companions</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, while I did get to see Kira and Zane talk, dance and sway in their little bottles, Sao and Faker weren’t quite ready to make their holographic debuts. But according to Razer, that’s sort of by design as Project Ava is very much a work in progress. Currently, the avatars’ responses are generated by X AI’s Grok (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">yikes!</a>), but the platform was created as a sort of open-source project that will support other models like Gemini or ChatGPT. </p><p>Down the line, Razer is hoping to add the ability for users to create their own unique avatars and companions based on their input or inspiration from real-world objects. Meanwhile, for avatars like Faker&#39;s because he’s also an actual person, Razer wants additional time to make the AI companion helpful with topics like real-time League of Legends coaching.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-zane.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-zane.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="Say hello to Giga Chad, I mean Zane.

Possibly the most exciting change is that Shorts are now listed as a content type, so the three-minute-or-less videos can be excluded as results in your searches. </p><p>This is a welcome update for any of us who have been on the hunt for a long-form explainer only to wade through dozens of ten-second clips before finding anything close to our goal.

The &quot;Sort By&quot; menu will now be called &quot;Prioritize.&quot; Likewise, the &quot;View Count&quot; option has been renamed to &quot;Popularity;&quot; this will allow YouTube&#39;s algorithms to account for other metrics such as watch time to gauge how much other users are engaging with a particular video. A pair of former filter options have also been removed; there will no longer be choices to search for &quot;Upload Date - Last Hour&quot; and &quot;Sort by Rating.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-will-let-you-exclude-shorts-from-search-results-204500097.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fender Audio may have announced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">new headphones and speakers</a> right before CES, but Las Vegas afforded us the first opportunity to see the brand’s new lineup in person. Fender Audio is a Fender-owned brand from Riffsound that’s designing and making new devices after licensing the name. It’s been a while since the guitar and amplifier company made any general-use speakers of its own, and this new arrangement is similar to what <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-20-marshall-updates-major-headphone-with-in-line-mic-for-more-talki.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Zound was doing with Marshall for a spell</a>. </p><p>Logistics out of the way, let’s get down to what the Mix and Ellie are like in the flesh. First, the Mix headphones offer a modular construction that allows you to replace nearly every piece as needed. The ear cups detach from the headband and the ear pads are replaceable. You can also swap out the battery, thanks to an easy-to-access slot behind one ear pad. And on the other side, a USB-C dongle for wireless lossless audio is stowed for safe keeping (wired lossless audio over USB-C is also available). </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Fender Audio Mix headphones" data-uuid="c9175cfb-32f0-4a57-9a22-cf0603105ae3"/><figcaption>Fender Audio Mix headphones</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fender Audio kept the controls simple on the Mix, opting for a single joystick for volume and playback changes. The joystick also serves as the power and pairing control as the only other button cycles through active noise cancellation (ANC) modes. In terms of sound, the Mix will satisfy listeners who crave deep bass, and vocals cut through clearly. In my brief demo, I would’ve liked more mid-range, but I’ll wait until I get a review unit for a full assessment there. I should mention the other standout feature is battery life: the Mix will offer up to 52 hours of use with ANC enabled (up to 100 hours with it off). </p><p>Then there are the Elie speakers. Both offer a similar set of features, which includes two wireless inputs for microphones (the company is working on its own model) and a combination XLR and 1/4-inch input for instruments. The Elie 06 is the smaller unit, housing a tweeter, full-range driver and subwoofer with 60 watts of output. The larger Elie 12 doubles all of that, serving as a more robust but still very portable option. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Fender Audio Ellie speakers" data-uuid="eabd1d5e-963f-4c92-abdb-8aab8fba9017"/><figcaption>Fender Audio Ellie speakers</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Both Elie units can be used in a single configuration or as a stereo pair. You can also connect up to 100 of the speakers via a Multi mode. Fender Audio has done a nice job here of checking all of the usual Bluetooth speaker boxes while offering something unique in terms all of those inputs. It’s like the company combined “regular” portable speakers with larger party boxes, offering something for customers who don’t want a massive device or any of the flashing lights. </p><p>Of course, none of these specs matter if the company didn’t ace the sound quality. While I’ll wait until I can spend several hours with some review units before I make any final judgement on these, I can tell you that both Elie speakers made a great first impression. There’s ample bass in the tuning for both, but obviously the larger Elie 12 offers more thump. Both units also provide excellent vocal clarity and nice details in the highs, as I made sure to select test tracks with lots of subtle sounds — like Bela Fleck’s banjo tunes. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-3.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speaker" data-uuid="55976e56-2bd8-4637-84bf-d2be1028642d"/><figcaption>The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speaker</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fender Audio says the arrival of the entire new lineup is imminent.

Companies including Samsung, LG and others came to the event ready to show off updates to existing display tech and some genuinely new technologies. OLED and Mini LED remain central to most lineups, while<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"> Micro RGB</a> has emerged as one of the most talked-about developments at the show so far, especially at the higher end of the TV market.</p><p>Below are the TV announcements that stood out most from the pre-show events and early press conferences, with more expected as CES continues. Also, be sure to check out our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best of CES 2026</a> list.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-micro-rgb-tvs">Samsung Micro RGB TVs</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d.jpeg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d.jpeg" style="height:1732px;width:2400px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="3d2cc73b-d866-4d15-86d0-f4c3f2bbd879"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p><p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;cpos:4;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p><p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward.  </p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2><p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p><p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p><p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-evo-w6-wallpaper-tv">LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" style="height:1327px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV" data-uuid="c57ab13f-a9b0-4a6e-b9be-88d620777eda"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="slk:LG&#x002019;s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV;cpos:6;pos:1">LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</a> makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p><p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2><p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;cpos:7;pos:1">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p><p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p><p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2><p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p><p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p><h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2><p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p><p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p><p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p><p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-new-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-from-samsung-lg-and-tcl-190929614.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps you like the idea of controlling your home appliances with your voice, but aren’t super keen on a data center processing recordings of you. Fair enough. The trade-off for most smart home conveniences is relinquishing at least some of your privacy. Today at CES, I saw a line of voice-controlled home appliances from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://emersonsmart.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Emerson Smart</a> that adjust power and setting via voice commands. But commands are recognized on the devices themselves, not carried through Wi-Fi and processed elsewhere. </p>
<p>The huge array of smart plugs, fans, heaters and even air fryers require no app for setup and don’t need access to Wi-Fi. Instead, I said, “hey Emerson, lights on” or “hey fan, turn on low” and the devices in the demo space acted accordingly. A few of the devices combine the mic with a speaker and can respond when a command is received. </p>
<p>A bit of built-in programing on the air fryers allow them to understand commands for 100 cooking presets, so saying things like, “reheat this pizza” or “cook these frozen french fries” will set the correct mode, time and temp. Of course you can also just say, “cook at 350 degrees for 10 minutes” and it’ll comply. Most of the commands for the other items are pretty simple but allow you to do things like set a timer, turn on oscillation and set intensity speeds. </p>

<p>Some of the devices allow for a small amount of programmability. Pressing and holding the button on the smart plug, for example, changes the wake word to “plug two,” doing it again swaps it to “plug three,” and so on. That way, if you have more than one plug in a room, you can operate them individually. </p>
<p>The small demo space in which I talked to the devices (that did its best to shut out the thrumming noise of the CES show floor) had at least six models active and listening for my words. When I said “Hey Emerson,” both an air fryer and one of the heaters responded. That was one of the limitations that I could see with the devices: If you outfit your entire home in Emerson Smart gear, it might take some time to name and position everything so it works in a coherent way. The lack of an app means that programmability is limited, too. That’s the trade-off the privacy-conscious or app-averse user will have to make if they want to turn their lamp on and fan up when they walk into a room just by talking. </p>
<p>As the only offline, non-DIY voice-controlled lineup of appliances out there, you’re stuck with whatever design Emerson Smart thinks look good. Thankfully, the overall design is clean and modern, if a little basic. The upcoming models of air purifiers and fans were decidedly more attractive. </p>

Trump made his disregard for climate change clear when he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/president-trump-withdraws-the-us-from-the-paris-climate-agreement-again-002803951.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement</a> for a second time in early 2025, but these new withdrawals further confirm the second Trump administration is against global collaboration in general.</p><p>Among the organizations targeted, the US will no longer participate in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and organizations focused on trade, conservation, reproductive rights and immigration, like International Trade Centre, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the UN Population Fund and the Global Forum on Migration and Development. In the case of the United Nations-affiliated organizations, the US ending its participation also means withdrawing funding.</p><p>According to the White House, the organizations the US is leaving &quot;promote radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength.&quot; Withdrawing is supposed to save taxpayers money, though the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-withdraws-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">White House&#39;s fact sheet on the executive order</a> neglects to say how much will be saved or how that saved money will be spent now that it&#39;s not supporting the United Nations.</p><p>&quot;By withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science and sowing distrust around the world,&quot; Former Vice President Al Gore said in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://algore.com/news/former-vice-president-al-gore-statement-on-u-s-withdrawal-from-international-climate-organizations" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a statement</a> responding to the executive order. </p><p>While losing financial backing likely doesn&#39;t help anyone, the actual impact of the US&#39;sdec withdrawals is a bit of an unknown, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-withdraws-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>The Washington Post </em>reports</a>. For example, the US remains involved with the International Energy Agency, which works on global clean energy solutions. Also, many of the organizations the White House decided to exit were deliberative bodies, or ones that the US was only marginally involved in, according to a UN official <em>The Post</em> spoke to.</p><p>Directly pushing back against global organizations and regulation has been a consistent theme of the second Trump administration, particularly in regards to tech regulation.

<p>It&#39;s been almost two months since Fubo has stopped carrying NBCUniversal-owned channels, and there&#39;s still no sign of them coming back to the streaming service. Customers have had to find alternate methods of watching <em>Sunday Night Football</em>, all the latest episodes of the<em> Real Housewives </em>franchise, and so much more because of Fubo and NBCUniversal&#39;s contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21.&nbsp;</p>

That&#39;s a dollar per month. This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21.</p> 
<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>
