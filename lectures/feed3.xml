                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-bring-space-station-astronauts-home-early-medical-issue-rcna253077" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">decided</a> to bring the Crew-11 astronauts home a month earlier than originally planned due to a “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/in-a-first-nasa-orders-astronauts-home-after-unspecified-medical-issue/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">medical concern</a>” with one of them. This is the first time in its history that the space agency is cutting a mission short due to a medical issue, but it didn’t identify the crew member or divulge the exact situation and its severity. The agency is targeting a return date no earlier than January 14, with the exact schedule depending on the weather. If NASA’s original plan pushes through, the crew will splash down off the coast of California at approximately 3:40 AM on January 15.</p><p>The agency previously <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-spacewalk-due-to-a-medical-concern-with-a-crew-member-171900024.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">postponed</a> an International Space Station (ISS) spacewalk scheduled for January 8, citing a medical concern with a crew member that appeared the day before. NASA’s chief health and medical officer, James “JD” Polk, said the affected astronaut is “absolutely stable” and that this isn’t a case of an emergency evacuation. The ISS has a “robust suite of medical hardware” onboard, he said, but not enough for a complete workup to determine a diagnosis. Without a proper diagnosis, NASA doesn’t know if the astronaut’s health could be negatively affected by the environment aboard the ISS. That is why the agency is erring on the side of caution. </p><p>Crew-11 left for the space station on August 1 and was supposed to come back to Earth on or around February 20. After they leave the station, only three people will remain: Two cosmonauts and one astronauts who’ll be in charge of all the experiments currently being conducted on the orbiting lab. The team’s replacement, Crew-12, was supposed to head to the ISS mid-February, but NASA is considering sending the astronauts to the station earlier than that. </p><p><strong>Update, January 10, 2025, 5:15AM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to include Crew-11’s tentative return date.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="slk:was out in full force;cpos:1;pos:1">was out in full force</a> covering the show.  The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.</p><p>More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It&#39;s appropriate, I guess, that as we&#39;re beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI&#39;s supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.</p><p>We&#39;re by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it&#39;s fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA&#39;s marathon keynote and Lenovo&#39;s somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it&#39;s been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weird new gadgets</a>, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.</p><p>Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.</p><p>If you&#39;ve been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there&#39;s still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — <em>Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief</em></p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5qnTT55ea8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><h2 id="jump-link-best-robot-switchbot-onero-h1">Best robot: Switchbot Onero H1</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_onero.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_onero.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Onero H1 robot" data-uuid="e8e2c923-e89e-4d67-a666-e9f22f20f070" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>Onero H1 robot</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Onero</div></figure><p>We saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026. While a lot of robots impressed us, there were fewer companies willing to commit to actually making them available. But Switchbot&#39;s Onero H1, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">we watched pick up clothes</a> and load a washing machine, is a helper robot the company intends to sell this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The demo we saw was limited, but Switchbot claims it can help with an array of household chores (even if it might do them more slowly than a human). It&#39;s also kind of cute. The company hasn&#39;t said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we&#39;ll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — <em>Karissa Bell, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-accessibility-tech-wheelmove">Best accessibility tech: WheelMove</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_wheelmove.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_wheelmove.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="WheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairs" data-uuid="ac1a306c-5ea6-49e7-a5dc-04f717de9f33" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>WheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairs</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">WheelMove</a> offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It&#39;s portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.</p><p>This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn&#39;t overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. <em>— Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editor</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-tv-lg-wallpaper-tv-oled-evo-w6">Best TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lg.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lg.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="LG OLED Evo W6 &quot;Wallpaper TV&quot;" data-uuid="04742b2b-d615-48aa-bb8d-ced3cef59625" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>LG OLED Evo W6 &quot;Wallpaper TV&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>I’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">LG’s OLED Evo W6</a>. It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.</p><p>And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. <em>— Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-ai-hardware-subtle-voicebuds">Best AI hardware: Subtle Voicebuds</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_voicebuds.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_voicebuds.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Subtle Voicebuds" data-uuid="3295301d-77a6-4b3a-a360-c7bc5e779c5e" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>Subtle Voicebuds</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Subtle</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-subtle-voicebuds-use-ai-to-transcribe-your-words-below-a-whisper-or-in-very-loud-spaces-like-the-ces-show-floor-000000019.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Subtle’s Voicebuds</a> are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it&#39;s below a whisper in quiet spaces. We’ve seen these things in action on the bustling CES show floor, where they managed to transcribe several sentences amid the chaos. The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, <em>and</em> you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.</p><p>While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products.

Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function.

Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter, and you&#39;ll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing.

And Apple has decided the theoretical safety of ICE officers is more valuable than the very real threat they pose to the communities they harass.</p><p>ICEBlock's availability on the App Store may not have changed the outcome of Wednesday's events. But it could resume its job as a community informer. It could make it easier to notify the public of where these masked thugs are congregating, perhaps even helping others avoid Good's fate.</p><p>Engadget has reached out to Apple for comment on reinstating ICEBlock; we’ll update if we receive a response.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/its-time-for-apple-to-reinstate-iceblock-220802356.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re wrapping up coverage of the biggest tech show in the world. CES 2026 is almost over, and while we have more stories and wrap-ups to come, here are the most interesting products we’ve spotted, written about and critiqued/praised. That includes our picks for the best of CES. We gave out 15 awards as well as our best of show, and you might be surprised by some of our picks — I know I was.</p>
<p>Read on for some of the best things to come out of Las Vegas this week, but first up, our Best of the Best winner, which was Lego Smart Play. As Engadget’s editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris put it, “Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product.”</p>
<p>Regardless of trends, Lego has always persisted. And in 2026, it’s getting much smarter.</p>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/1ba18890-ed90-11f0-bedf-a52201b3b314" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/1ba18890-ed90-11f0-bedf-a52201b3b314" style="height:360px;width:640px;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="c8d0caa4-1535-35c1-861f-d2f7ba55b3e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lego</div></figure></a>
<p>The system consists of a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html">Smart Brick, Tags and Minifigure</a>s. They’re packed with modern technology, so they can respond to how you play with them or the sets you build. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip, which Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html"><ins>right here</ins></a>), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>On Monday, which feels like an age ago, Jensen Huang shared the latest from NVIDIA. While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says can drive more like a human.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>

If you wanted to find a robotic lawn mower, throw a rock. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Humanoid robots</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lockins-everlasting-vein-recognizing-smart-lock-doorbell-cam-combo-is-peak-ces-013431113.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">smart locks</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">super thin TVs</a> were everywhere. But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. </p><p>Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths. This year, there were 38, but that’s in part due to the combination of the energy and sustainability categories. So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. </p><p>Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-withdraws-from-dozens-of-international-bodies-including-climate-focused-organizations-195259578.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">multitude of problems</a> the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. </p><p>But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">best of CES</a> status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. </p><p>Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas. And gosh darn it, at least these guys are trying.   </p><h2 id="jump-link-shine-turbine-20">Shine Turbine 2.0</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/shine_turbine_7698.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/shine_turbine_7698.gif" style="height:730px;width:1374px;" alt="Spinning the Shine Turbine 2.0" data-uuid="a9e3d7a2-9b3f-4624-bba6-1700093ac050"><figcaption>Spinning the Shine 2.0 wind turbine</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>This little guy could be a precursor to some serious personal wind power generation.

And I thought, like paper-wrapped batteries? Nope. The chemicals inside the batteries are made from cellulose. They have a solvent-free, lithium-free, PFAS-free  chemistry and break down by 70 percent in four weeks in a composting environment. They use the same basic architecture as a lithium-ion cell, with an anode, cathode and separator with ion transfers between the two. As of now, Flint is focused on partnering with manufacturers, and consumer products are on the horizon. </p><p>Learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flintlabs.com/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Flint</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-clear-drop-soft-plastics-compactor">Clear Drop soft plastics compactor</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/clear_drop_cpc.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/clear_drop_cpc.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="The Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces." data-uuid="cba4b76b-6a1d-4b19-9057-6c891d31cefb"><figcaption>The Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Clear Drop is a soft plastics compactor that creates eight by twelve by four-inch bricks out of hundreds of grocery bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks and plastic packaging.

Alpha Power by CPTI creates lightweight, flexible perovskite solar panels that can conform to multiple surfaces.

This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems. HydroVigor is currently in use in many buildings in Singapore and Hong Kong and they’re working to expand to more buildings globally. </p><p>Learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.green-vigor.com/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">GreenVigor</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-jackery-solar-gazebo">Jackery Solar Gazebo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jackery_gazebo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jackery_gazebo.jpg" style="height:1463px;width:2600px;" alt="Jackery&#39;s Solar Gazebo.

It’s a modular design that lets you choose louvered walls, sunshades, lights and fans when you order it and the solar panels are so strong that a full-sized human Jackery rep was able to stand on a sample panel in front of me and nothing cracked (though the company officially rates it at 20 pounds of snow per square foot). You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. </p><p>Learn more at <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8da55429-10fd-4eee-82eb-d6c6521942a5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5d60aade-77de-4a76-affd-d89b1ce8308b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=jackery&amp;linkText=Jackery&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWNrZXJ5LmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVkNjBhYWRlLTc3ZGUtNGE3Ni1hZmZkLWQ4OWIxY2U4MzA4YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamFja2VyeS5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATTeES63DooitJp1bcNsKSjdj5qb_cSlWYTlEEyRdBvG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jackery.com%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:jackery;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.jackery.com/">Jackery</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-bluetti-rv-solar-system">Bluetti RV Solar System</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bluetti_power.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bluetti_power.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Bluetti&#39;s DIY RV Solar power system" data-uuid="dcf4a9c3-8640-47d7-b562-40d2b912e8e4"><figcaption>Bluetti&#39;s DIY RV Solar power system</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Bluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dell&#39;s XPS 14 now costs over $2,000. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.</p><p>Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months</a>, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung&#39;s marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-warns-of-price-hikes-as-rising-memory-costs-affect-all" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">told Bloomberg</a> at CES: &quot;There&#39;s going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it&#39;s going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.&quot;</p><p>Dell&#39;s new XPS 14 and XPS 16 are among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year&#39;s models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. But Dell later announced a shocking price jump: The XPS 14 now starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. </p><p>While it didn&#39;t take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000, it&#39;s genuinely wild to me that the entry-level models are already starting there. And meanwhile, Apple still hasn&#39;t budged its $1,599  MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.</p><p>On the desktop front, AMD&#39;s David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company&#39;s AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.</p><p>&quot;I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,&quot; he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. &quot;Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there&#39;s a pretty big boost there.&quot;</p><p>McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD&#39;s business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no product that has memory in it that&#39;s immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it&#39;s doing to the market,&quot; he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. &quot;I think the, the truth is the volatility that we&#39;ve seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.&quot; </p><p>Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn&#39;t discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD&#39;s X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don&#39;t see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.</p><p>That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. </p><p>And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/#:~:text=Table_title:%20From%20NVIDIA%20Grace%20to%20Vera%E2%80%94scaling%20the,CPU:%20900GB/s%20%7C%20Vera%20CPU:%201.8TB/s%20%7C" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Vera Rubin AI supercomputer</a>, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2026/from-ces-2026-to-yottaflops-why-the-amd-keynote.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">new Helios AI rack</a>, which supports up to  31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.</p><p>Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.  </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clicks is an apologetically gadgety company, making gear that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/clicks-hands-on-a-charming-keyboard-for-2024-thats-relying-on-more-than-just-nostalgia-131537619.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">feels charmingly out-of-place</a> in a world where almost every smartphone out there is an all-screen slab. That was obviously two years ago when the company first revealed its keyboard case that brought tactile typing to the iPhone and eventually other Android devices. Rather than that being a one-off curiosity, the company had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">two new announcements</a> at CES 2026: a magnetic keyboard accessory that also doubles as a battery bank and small, squat mobile phone with a keyboard. And while there isn’t a working prototype of the Clicks Communicator available for the press to see, I got to check out the new Power Keyboard talk with Clicks co-founder and former BlackBerry marketing director Jeff Gadway about where he thinks his products fit into the smartphone world.</p><p>At first glance, the $79 Power Keyboard feels like a big improvement over the original Clicks Keyboard case. It magnetically attaches to any phone with Qi2 and connects over Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is similar to the original Clicks keyboard, but there’s a dedicated number row which is a nice improvement. But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard." data-uuid="0ce88f11-8353-414f-af2a-31e90ceac187"><figcaption>The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached." data-uuid="d7e2775d-42b4-4516-ab1c-fc8d809e1e93"><figcaption>The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.</p><p>The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. </p><p>“You&#39;ve got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you&#39;ve got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there&#39;s a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You&#39;ve got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you&#39;ve got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications." data-uuid="383d6067-92af-4f84-ac04-08018df735a3"><figcaption>The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn&#39;t your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”</p><p>That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b747fd19-ae32-4fad-ae62-84f9d8942106&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+Niagara+Android+launcher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Yml0cGl0LmxhdW5jaGVyJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNzQ3ZmQxOS1hZTMyLTRmYWQtYWU2Mi04NGY5ZDg5NDIxMDYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1iaXRwaXQubGF1bmNoZXImaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVzMyKyse3TDKidO_Oy2Ej2eR8LRmly8IFYzm1Y2whhd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dbitpit.launcher%26hl%3Den_US" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;hl=en_US">the Niagara Android launcher</a>, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we&#39;ve optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it&#39;s not the thing you&#39;re going to reach for to do that. But we&#39;re not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”</p><p>The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-clicks-co-founder-explains-who-its-tiny-communicator-phone-is-for-170000501.html?src=rss]]></description>

The social media giant is partnering with power companies Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo to deliver an expected 6.6 gigawatts of generation to its projects by 2035.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s agreement with TerraPower will fund the development of two new reactors capable of delivering up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032. The deal also gives Meta rights to energy from six other reactors that could deliver an additional 2.1 gigawatts by 2035. All this power would come from TerraPower&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.terrapower.com/natrium/"><ins>&quot;Natrium&quot; reactors</ins></a>, which use sodium instead of water as a coolant.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A partnership with Oklo will bring 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear power online as early as 2030. Meta says the agreement opens the door to the construction of multiple Oklo reactors, which it claims will create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs in Ohio.

<p>Meta’s agreement with Vistra focuses on keeping existing nuclear plants running longer and boosting their output. Through new 20-year deals, Meta will buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of electricity from some of Vistra’s existing plants in Ohio, while also backing added capacity at those sites, plus another in Pennsylvania. Vistra expects the added capacity, totaling 433 megawatts, to come online in the early 2030s.</p>

Of course, we kept tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, LG showed off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There was some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weird tech</a>.</p><p>You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either.

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. </p><p>The first “<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;slk:Smart Play;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will unleash three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and the imperial march.</p><p>Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000436.html" data-i13n="slk:check out Lego&#x002019;s Smart Play system in person;cpos:9;pos:1">check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person</a> and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.</p><p>All of this seems extremely cool.

These are the first chips built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says these chips offer improvements to performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life  for laptops. </p><p>The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased an Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.</p><p>Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some <em>Battlefield 6</em> on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html" data-i13n="slk:came away impressed;cpos:23;pos:1">came away impressed</a>. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU.

The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the previous iteration.</p><h2 id="jump-link-laptops">Laptops </h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9e798a0-ea85-11f0-bbd1-8dfc40a2d49e" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9e798a0-ea85-11f0-bbd1-8dfc40a2d49e" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on" data-uuid="019d82a5-f976-3c30-a7a3-adb8b27653b1"><figcaption>Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure><p>What would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips?

OlloBot is designed to “grow” alongside your family — it can capture special moments and develop its own personality. Data is stored locally on a removable heart-shaped module for both privacy and the ability to move it to a new OlloBot should your first one break. </p><p>The device’s “face” is a tablet that can display videos, photo and expressions. The robot can handle calls, find missing items and help you control Matter-compatible smart home devices. It responds to your voice and touch too. </p><p>The team behind the robot plans to fire up a Kickstarter campaign this summer. The regular model will cost about $1,000, while the one with an extending neck will run you about twice that. Best of all, there will be several outfits available for the robots, including a giraffe suit.

Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. </p><p>It’s interesting stuff.

It&#39;s one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. </p><p>While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXSqguJ3J0c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html" data-i13n="cpos:120;pos:1">Narwhal</a> built a new vacuum for your mattress.

Like the Xreal 1S, it’s available now.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG-Xreal-R1-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG-Xreal-R1-2.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses are a collaboration between ASUS and XREAL made just for gamers." data-uuid="56176b67-f224-4b83-83e1-a405cdb13659"><figcaption>The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses are a collaboration between ASUS and XREAL made just for gamers.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>ASUS and Xreal teamed up to make the gaming-focused <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html" data-i13n="cpos:153;pos:1">ROG Xreal R1 smart glasses</a>.

Much of that tech perhaps doesn&#39;t quite fit neatly into the above categories. So let&#39;s jam through some of those announcements in bullet point format:</p><ul><li><p>HP revived an old trend by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/hps-new-eliteboard-made-me-believe-in-keyboard-computers-again-033000022.html" data-i13n="cpos:157;pos:1">stuffing a computer</a> inside a keyboard.</p></li><li><p>We&#39;ve long liked Satechi&#39;s Thunderbolt 4 docking stations around these parts, so you can bet the brand&#39;s first Thunderbolt 5 version will make us sit up and pay attention. With the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/satechi-is-embracing-thunderbolt-5-at-ces-with-a-new-dock-and-cable-170000137.html" data-i13n="slk:Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure;cpos:158;pos:1">Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure</a> and new Pro Cable, Satechi is promising support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. The dock has several other ports and slots, including a headphone jack. You can stuff an 8TB SSD into the $400 CubeDock too.</p></li><li><p>Yukai Engineering&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/yukai-engineerings-latest-gadget-at-ces-is-a-fan-for-babies-000000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:159;pos:1">Baby FuFu</a> is a larger version of the company’s drink-cooling Nekojita FuFu gizmo. It’s a portable fan for babies that hooks onto strollers.</p></li><li><p>Anker&#39;s Eufy showed off a baby bottle washer with built-in water softener to help remove stubborn minerals, sterilization up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and the ability to dry bottles in 40 minutes. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/eufy-just-revealed-a-tech-heavy-baby-bottle-washer-at-ces-160021666.html" data-i13n="cpos:160;pos:1">Bottle Washer S1</a> also offers app control, the capability to clean up to eight bottle sets at once and the option to keep them in a sterile state for up to 72 hours.</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/clear-drop-is-trying-to-do-something-about-all-those-plastic-bags-under-your-sink-140000254.html" data-i13n="slk:Clear Drop;cpos:161;pos:1">Clear Drop</a> can compress soft plastics (such as grocery bags that recycling centers typically don&#39;t accept) into cubes that can be sent off for recycling. It&#39;s a compelling idea, even if the company&#39;s device costs $1,400.</p></li><li><p>It&#39;s always fun to learn about developments in the smart bird feeder space. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/birdbuddys-new-smart-bird-feeder-can-id-birds-by-their-songs-122000692.html" data-i13n="cpos:162;pos:1">Birdbuddy</a> showed off two new models in different sizes, each with HD cameras and mics that can identify birds by their songs. The larger Birdbuddy 2 also has built-in solar panels.</p></li></ul><p>That about does it for all the key news coming out of CES 2026.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/lg-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-companys-world-premiere-event-190159076.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">LG opened CES 2026</a> by outlining its vision to reduce the physical effort and mental burden of life. Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">robot</a> will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.</p><p>There’s obvious reasons for this: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">AI swallowed</a> the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Panther Lake</a> is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">from EVs</a> and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">production lines</a>, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTRC3lOEg8j/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch</a>. At least, I <em>hope</em> they were pretending.</p><p>I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I&#39;ve got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">toilet computers</a>, massage chairs and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu28o7TF8IE" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">scootcases</a> we all need in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-put-a-waifu-in-a-bottle-at-ces-2026-205315908.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Holographic AI waifus</a> that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-the-latest-gadgets-at-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146311.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">AI Labubus</a> operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">tablet on a moveable base</a> that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company&#39;s humanoid may have been the busiest bot at show, autonomously playing ping-pong, dealing blackjack games and taking selfies with passersby. On display wasn&#39;t just the robot and its smarts, but also SharpaWave, a highly dexterous 1:1 scale human hand.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/yMpCKnQY" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>The hand has 22 active degrees of freedom, according to the company, allowing for precise and intricate finger movements. It mirrored my gestures as I wiggled my hand in front of its camera, getting everything mostly right, which was honestly pretty cool. Each fingertip contains a minicamera and over 1,000 tactile pixels so it can pick up objects with the appropriate amount of delicateness for the task at hand, like plucking a playing card from a deck and placing it gently on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharpa&#39;s robot was a pretty good ping-pong player, too.

The company&#39;s products are meant to be general-purpose, with the ability to handle a wide range of jobs, and its humanoid wore a lot of hats at CES to drive the point home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/sharpas-ping-pong-playing-blackjack-dealing-humanoid-is-working-overtime-at-ces-2026-150000488.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker rolled out a bunch of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-unveils-a-new-lineup-of-chargers-and-docks-at-ces-2026-160021195.html">new chargers</a> and other gear at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html">CES 2026</a>, including a cute one that's already on sale. The new Nano charger with smart display, which is an upgrade to the existing Nano charger in Anker's lineup, is on sale for $30 right now while you can pre-order it. That's $10 off the regular MSRP, and shipments will start going out on January 20.</p> 
<p>The 45W charger includes a smart display that shows real-time data like power flow, temperature and charging status. It also features "fun animations to keep things cheerful." Anker says it can recognize what's being charged and automatically adjust certain metrics to ensure a longer battery lifespan.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="1f0c9e1aa28c4e6cb8e2f5b6045a4e14" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.anker.com/products/a121d-45w-usb-c-fast-charger-foldable-plug-compact?variant=46070529228950"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> 
<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout. If that doesn't work, it's <strong>WS24D5XT3DV9</strong>. We haven't gotten a chance to try this one yet, but it looks promising.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-new-anker-45w-nano-charger-with-smart-display-from-ces-is-10-off-already-160707620.html?src=rss]]></description>

Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D54JZTHY&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=24b60c33-f851-4bee-9d8b-9c00c8cc034a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=AirTags&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRiNjBjMzMtZjg1MS00YmVlLTlkOGItOWMwMGM4Y2MwMzRhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR-tHxD_n-S9V6FZTggBPzQxNCDZMIugRbDnHNS6azZ_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?">AirTags</a> for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we&#39;ve seen for these Bluetooth trackers.</p>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ollobot">OlloBot</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Two OlloBots &#x002014; one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other &#x002014; are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks." data-uuid="7271ae67-acb9-4987-ae67-517ef063f68e"><figcaption>Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>CES loves a companion robot, but <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html" data-i13n="slk:OlloBot;cpos:4;pos:1">OlloBot</a> might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.</p><h2 id="jump-link-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo">ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&amp;#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits." data-uuid="3b80f798-cec6-305a-954f-3f36c7222243"><figcaption>On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&amp;#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect.

It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.</p><h2 id="jump-link-throne-toilet-computer">Throne toilet computer</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet." data-uuid="1b6635a2-cf8b-41f8-9247-68a48520eee5"><figcaption>The Throne device perched on the side of a toilet.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Throne</a> is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.thronescience.com/products/throne-one" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">toilet-mounted computer</a> that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.</p><h2 id="jump-link-vivoo-hygienic-flowpad-smart-menstrual-pad">Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" style="height:698px;width:1280px;" alt="Image of Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad" data-uuid="a782ed2d-1d1b-4b9b-8be4-934943b97f7f"><figcaption>Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivoo</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/vivoos-toilet-computer-keeps-an-eye-on-your-hydration-030000209.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Vivoo</a> looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized.

Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo-thinkbook-xd-rollable">Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid." data-uuid="5ca5fe56-6894-4cd9-8f38-2fd1b5e0de40"><figcaption>With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">ThinkBook XD Rollable</a> is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ohdoki-handy-2-pro">OhDoki Handy 2 Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" style="height:1012px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro" data-uuid="9f025e81-246a-4ff1-810a-6824e6d7216a"><figcaption>Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-handy-2-pro-is-an-overclockable-sex-toy-044456140.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro</a> arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ipolish">iPolish</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">iPolish</a> finally made <em>Total Recall</em> nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger.

It’s a 32-inch 4K smart display on wheels that you manually drag from room to room, delivering strong TV-and-VCR-on-a-cart energy, just with Wi-Fi 6, a built-in camera, far-field mics and a 10-hour battery. It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ge-profile-smart-fridge">GE Profile Smart Fridge</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/GE_Profile_Smart_Fridge_dislplay.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/GE_Profile_Smart_Fridge_dislplay.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Finally!

A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dolby may have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-announces-dolby-vision-2-expanding-picture-quality-beyond-hdr-123019504.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced Dolby Vision 2</a> a few months ago, but the company gave the new platform its first big reveal at CES 2026. I got the chance to see the improvements in person for the first time, thanks to a variety of demos and Q&amp;A sessions. Dolby Vision 2 will be available this year, but initially, it will be limited. As such, I’ve compiled the info on where the image engine will be available first, and what’s likely to come next in terms of where and how you can use it. But first, let’s quickly summarize what Dolby Vision 2 will even do for your TV.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-is-dolby-vision-2">What is Dolby Vision 2?</h2><p>Dolby Vision 2 is Dolby’s next-generation image engine that the company announced in September. The new standard will do several things to improve picture quality on your TV, including content recognition that optimizes your TV based on what and where you’re watching. This first element will improve scenes that many viewers complain are too dark, compensate for ambient lighting and apply motion adjustments for live sports and gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Dolby Vision 2 will also deliver new tone mapping for improved color reproduction. I witnessed this first hand in various demos at CES, and this is the biggest difference between the current Dolby Vision and DV2 for me.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also a new Authentic Motion feature that will provide the optimal amount of smoothing so that content appears more “authentically cinematic,” according to Dolby. This means getting rid of unwanted judder, but stopping short of the so-called soap opera effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, Dolby is taking advantage of all of the capabilities of today’s TVs, harnessing the improvements to display quality and processing power that companies have developed in the decade since Dolby Vision first arrived.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-tvs-will-support-dolby-vision-2">What TVs will support Dolby Vision 2?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/X11L-Lifestyle-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/X11L-Lifestyle-1.jpg" style="height:3072px;width:5504px;" alt="Lifestyle photo of the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED Series" data-uuid="550f5cf0-95f7-45bb-bdaa-44c34e0d869d"/><figcaption>Lifestyle photo of the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED Series</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>The biggest Dolby Vision 2 news at CES was the first three TV makers that have pledged support for the new standard. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/hisense-introduces-its-first-ever-consumer-microled-tv-194057452.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Hisense</a> is bringing it to its 2026 RGB MiniLED TVs — including UX, UR9 and UR8. The company also plans to add it to more MiniLED TVs with an OTA update. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/tcl-unveils-its-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tvs-at-ces-2026-205532386.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">TCL&#39;s 2026 X QD-Mini LED TV Series</a> and C Series will support Dolby Vision 2 via a future update. It will be available on TP Vision’s Philips’ 2026 OLED TVs, including the 2026 Philips OLED811, and OLED911 series as well as the flagship OLED951.</p><p>There are sure to be other companies that announce Dolby Vision 2 support in 2026. Sony doesn’t announce its new TVs at CES anymore, so that’s just one of the bigger names that’s yet to reveal its hand.&nbsp;Any upcoming TVs that seek to leverage the full suite of tools that Dolby Vision 2 offers will need to have an ambient light sensor as that’s one of the key facets of Dolby’s upgrade. </p><h2 id="jump-link-what-content-will-be-available-in-dolby-vision-2">What content will be available in Dolby Vision 2?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dolby-vision-atmos.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dolby-vision-atmos.jpg" style="height:900px;width:1600px;" alt="Peacock is bringing Dolby Vision and Atmos support to more live sports offerings." data-uuid="982e3f94-6264-461d-95e2-d1ebaf705d66"/><figcaption>Peacock is bringing Dolby Vision and Atmos support to more live sports offerings.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Peacock</div></figure><p>The other big piece of Dolby Vision 2 news at CES 2026 was the first streaming service that will support the platform. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/peacock-is-expanding-dolby-vision-and-atmos-availability-for-live-sports-023000794.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Peacock grabbed that honor</a>, and so far it’s the only streamer to pledge support. However, several services support the current version of Dolby Vision, including Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and Paramount+. Like the additional TV support that’s sure to be announced throughout the year, I expect more streaming services will jump on board soon as well. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-vision-2-is-coming-this-year-heres-what-you-need-to-know-140000034.html?src=rss]]></description>

It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>

Whisper Aero’s aerospace-derived motor redesign delivers 880 CFM of airflow at around 52 decibels, which we could confirm even amid the noise of the show floor. It also runs up to 50 minutes in Eco mode, supports a forthcoming battery backpack and even includes an LED for nighttime cleanup. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://toneoutdoors.com/products/t1" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Pre-orders are open now for $599</a>, with shipping expected in September.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ge-profile-smart-fridge">GE Profile Smart Fridge</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/GE_Profile_Smart_Fridge_dislplay.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/GE_Profile_Smart_Fridge_dislplay.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Finally!

GE’s AI assistant can answer practical questions like where your water filter is, scan groceries via a built-in barcode reader and keep tabs on produce with a crisper drawer camera. The eight-inch display feels refreshingly restrained, while integrations with Instacart and recipe suggestions add utility. It launches in March for $4,899, and for once, we’re genuinely curious what it would be like to live with it.</p><h2 id="jump-link-longbow-motors-speedster-ev">Longbow Motors Speedster EV</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Longbow Motors Speedster" data-uuid="221cff0b-9ddd-4c0c-aa68-e34e9222b104"/><figcaption>Longbow Motors Speedster</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ces-2026-longbow-motors-shows-off-its-speedster-ev-with-donut-labs-in-wheel-motors-192329111.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Longbow Motors</a> brought one of the most emotionally compelling EVs we’ve seen to CES, and it’s unapologetically minimalist. The Speedster uses in-wheel motors from Donut Labs to hit a jaw-dropping curb weight of just 2,200 pounds, lighter than a Miata. Its stripped-back interior, mystery shift lever and exposed motors feel like a direct rejection of touchscreen-heavy modern cars. It’s wildly expensive at just under $100,000, but also one of the few EVs here that got us excited to drive.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ollobot-companion-robot">OlloBot companion robot</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ollobot%20CES%202026.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ollobot%20CES%202026.jpg" style="height:853px;width:1280px;" alt="A robot with eyes on top of a screen showing a smile." data-uuid="1dc05124-9b6f-41b9-91da-b9dcb82fa570"/><figcaption>A robot with eyes on top of a screen showing a smile.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">OlloBot</a> might win the award for most charmingly strange robot on the show floor. Designed as a family “cyber pet,” it responds to voice and touch, develops a personality over time and stores all its memories locally in a removable heart-shaped module. The robot can help find lost items, make calls and eventually control Matter smart home devices. A Kickstarter is planned for summer, with pricing starting around $1,000.</p><h2 id="jump-link-bluetti-charger-2">Bluetti Charger 2</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/BLUETTI_Charger_2_-_RV_Solution.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/BLUETTI_Charger_2_-_RV_Solution.jpg" style="height:1918px;width:4096px;" alt="Image demonstrating the setup for Bluetti&#39;s Charger 2" data-uuid="c61c695f-5552-43ef-b7d4-ac79ee560833"/><figcaption>Here&#39;s how the Bluetti Charger 2 would work with dual charging sources.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bluetti</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/bluettis-charger-2-uses-solar-and-engine-power-to-charge-your-portable-battery-230000270.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Bluetti’s Charger 2</a> fixes a very specific but real problem for off-grid users: charging from your engine and solar panels at the same time. The dual-input system supports up to 600W from solar and 800W from an alternator, dramatically speeding up battery top-ups. It also works with multiple Bluetti power stations and can even jump-start your vehicle in a pinch. Early pricing is $349 through February 7, after which it jumps to $499.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ces-is-ending-but-weve-got-more-stories-to-tell">CES is ending, but we’ve got more stories to tell</h2><p>The CES show floor will soon be closing down, but Engadget still has a lot of stories in our pipeline.

You can pick up the smartwatch for $299, which is 25 percent off its regular price, a discount of $100. Discounts tend to increase as we get closer to September, when the next generation of Apple Watch is typically announced.</p>

<p>The Series 11 is our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">best overall smartwatch</a> pick, and we gave it a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html">hands-on review</a>. We were impressed with the battery life, which lasted longer than the 24 hours it&#39;s rated for in our testing. We also liked how lightweight and thin the watch is. The 9.7mm thick case on the Series 11 ties the Series 10 for the thinnest Apple Watch so far.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Fitness and health tracking are the main appeals of an Apple Watch, and the Series 11 introduces sleep tracking and hypertension notifications. The sleep tracking was comfortable thanks to the watch&#39;s small form factor. The watch also added a new wrist flick gesture that lets you dismiss notifications, end calls and silence alarms or timers.</p> 
<p>The GPS + cellular model of the Series 11 is also $100 off, and it&#39;s the first Apple Watch to support 5G networks. It&#39;s not too often you see an Apple product for 25 percent off its retail price, so if you were in the market for a smart watch, and especially if you are an iPhone user, it&#39;s worth checking out.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kia has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.kianewscenter.com/news/all/kia-unveils-ev2-at-brussels-motor-show/s/fea22a3c-6664-463f-87d2-c17de0e5dfb9">unveiled</a> its new entry level electric vehicle, the EV2. The boxy model strongly resembles the company&#39;s Soul (Kia did make an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-2020-kia-soul-ev-first-drive.html">electric Soul</a> at one point) and has very similar dimensions, though it&#39;s slightly shorter in height and length. It&#39;s not exactly a range monster and will charge a bit slower than the competition. The EV2 launched at the Brussels Motor Show and the company said it has no plans for US availability at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EV2 uses Kia/Hyundai&#39;s E-GMP platform and slots into the bottom of its EV lineup as an &quot;entry point to electric mobility,&quot; according to the automaker. Though nearly the same size, it certainly looks nicer than the dowdy Soul and has more room inside. Competition-wise, it&#39;s going up against <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-ex30-first-drive-charming-and-eco-friendly-with-power-to-spare-080039873.html">Volvo&#39;s EX30</a> and may cost about the same, though Kia has yet to divulge pricing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EV2 will be offered with two battery options: a 42kWh battery with 197 miles of WLTP range (likely around 170 miles by EPA standards) and 61kWh with 278 miles of WLPT range (around 240 EPA miles). That&#39;s not a lot, especially compared to the 261 mile EPA max range of the EX30 — so Kia&#39;s pricing for the EV2 will be key. As for charging speeds, Kia says the EV2 will charge from 10 to 80 percent in about 30 minutes — a bit slower than the 69 kWh EX30. Like other Kia vehicles, the EV2 supports vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-load (V2L/V2G) charging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kia calls the vehicle&#39;s interior a &quot;Picnic Box&quot; as a way to describe the small but useful space. Kia says its &quot;comparable to larger vehicles&quot; in terms of space, with generous rear legroom and rear cargo capacity up to 403 liters. It will come in four- and five-seat versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for tech inside, it offers a generous screen setup, with a 12.3-inch instrument cluster, 12.3-inch infotainment screen and a 5-inch climate display. Ambient lighting in the cabin syncs up with specific vehicle functions. At the same time, it offers a fully array of manual controls climate, volume control and more. It comes with multiple USB-C ports (three up front) that support up to 100W charging.</p>
<p>The company has yet to reveal performance figures other than range. Production is set to start in Q1, so deliveries should commence in Europe and other regions later in the year. It doesn&#39;t look like the EV2 will arrive stateside any time soon, though, as the company said it &quot;has not announced plans for the US market.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/kias-budget-ev2-arrives-with-up-to-240-miles-of-range-130038144.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Probably my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">favorite thing</a> about the Lego Smart Play system <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">unveiled this week</a> at CES is that it was designed for kids, first and foremost. In the past 10 years or so, Lego has increasingly courted an older audience with more expensive and elaborate sets. But when it was time to bring more advanced technology to Lego, the idea right from the beginning was more social and interactive play.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t heard about Smart Play yet, its a way for Lego to make its sets more interactive. A Smart Brick filled with sensors makes it so sets can respond to each other, know when they’re moving, play sounds and know when the corresponding Smart Minifigures are near them. Tiny Smart Tags, meanwhile, help the Smart Brick know the context of how it’s being used — whether it’s in a helicopter, car or duck for example. </p><p>Tom Donaldson, senior VP and Head of Creative Play Lab at the LEGO Group, told Engadget that the company worked on Smart Play for about eight years before introducing it this week, and that social play was the starting point. “We started really looking at consumer needs, and this idea that kids really like social play,” said Donaldson “Kids really like the sort of things that change when they come back to them, and the kids really like agency. They want to be able to change things.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/_2DB6431_5eTSELom.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/_2DB6431_5eTSELom.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="Lego&#39;s Tom Donaldson demoing Smart Play at CES." data-uuid="bf8d975a-2afa-4bf7-8808-cb68210e259e"/><figcaption>Lego&#39;s Tom Donaldson demoing Smart Play at CES.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LEGO</div></figure><p>But a big part of the creation process was making the Smart Brick as flexible and powerful as possible and then seeing what scenarios could take advantage of it. “We wanted to build a really powerful platform,”&nbsp; he said. “What we shouldn&#39;t do is say, ‘this is what we think we&#39;re gonna need.’ We needed to say, ‘let&#39;s create something that has a lot of capabilities that we can then figure out how to use.’”</p><p>One of the conflicts with the tech-packed Smart Play system, though, might be the cost. Obviously, Lego has been successful at most ventures it has undertaken in recent years, but the pricing of Smart Play sets could make adoption a bit challenging. The biggest Smart Play set, Star Wars Throne Room Duel &amp; A-Wing, for example, has almost 1,000 pieces and costs $160. That’s quite a bit more than comparably sized sets. The dual factors of the Star Wars license and Smart Play tech certainly impacted the cost.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/75427_Lifestyle_envr.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/75427_Lifestyle_envr.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="Lego Smart Play Star Wars set" data-uuid="b3e317b2-394e-4b38-90c5-575e2c1082c7"/><figcaption>Lego Smart Play Star Wars set</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LEGO</div></figure><p>The set includes two Smart Bricks, five Smart Tags and three Smart Minifigures, the most “smart” gear included in any of the initial three Star Wars Smart Play sets. Will parents shell out for the more advanced capabilities that Smart Play offers, or will they stick with standard sets? </p><p>For now, Lego is betting the extremely broad appeal of Star Wars will help these new Smart Play sets find an audience. About three years ago, Lego got its team focused on the Star Wars franchise involved, as well as Lucasfilm, to figure out how to roll Smart Play out to the world. “Very early on, we all decided that starting with the original trilogy would be great,” said Derek Stothard, Disney’s Director of Global Licensing “These are such well-known scenes and characters, and they cross generations, so parents can introduce them to&nbsp; their kids. All that works really well together.”&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lego is being coy about where things go beyond the initial three Star Wars sets, but it’s clear that after eight years of development, they’ll want to bring it to as many product lines as possible. “We&#39;re announcing a platform that you can see has tremendous growth [potential], Donaldson said. “We made the analogy with the minifigure as something that you’ll see across the entire [Lego] system, maybe not in every single SKU but it’ll reappear in many different places. But ultimately we&#39;re a company that really focuses on giving kids what they want, what they love, and we&#39;ll have to see how it lives in a market.”</p><p>That last point about how it lives in the market is a good one, particularly given the pricing. We probably won’t know for sure until Lego moves beyond the safe confines of Star Wars and really shows us what Smart Play can do across more varied scenarios. And going to non-licensed sets might be where Smart Play really takes off — it’s easy to imagine a cheaper Smart Play add-on kit that can bring sets to life at a lower cost. But the idea of transforming anything kids create into something more interactive has a ton of potential if Lego can broaden its appeal beyond Star Wars fans.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-is-trying-to-make-tech-invisible-with-smart-play-130000979.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are no recruitment ads for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) running on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-cancel-your-spotify-subscription-133022215.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Spotify</a> at the moment, the streaming service has told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://variety.com/2026/digital/news/spotify-confirms-ice-recruitment-ads-are-no-longer-running-1236626243/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Variety</em></a>. A spokesperson has confirmed the news after an ICE agent fatally shot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-shooting-minneapolis-minnesota-9aa822670b705c89906f2c699f1d16c5" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Renee Good</a> in Minneapolis, but they also clarified that the ads stopped running in late 2025. “The advertisements mentioned were part of a US government recruitment campaign that ran across all major media and platforms,” they explained. </p><p>Spotify <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-cancel-your-spotify-subscription-133022215.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">caught flak</a> back in October for playing ICE ads, asking people to “join the mission to protect America,” in between songs for users on the ad-supported plan. The advertisements even promised $50,000 signing bonuses for new recruits. Campaigns were launched to urge users to cancel their subscriptions and to boycott the service, and even music labels called on the company to stop serving ICE advertisements. Spotify said back then that the ads don’t violate its policies and that users can simply mark them with a thumbs up or down to let the platform know their preferences. </p><p>The company reportedly received $74,000 from Homeland Security for the ICE ads, but that’s a tiny amount compared to what other companies received. According to a report by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-ads-all-over-streaming-services-spotify-hbo-pandora-1235447970/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Google and YouTube were paid $3 million for Spanish-language ads that called for self-deportation, while Meta received $2.8 million. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-no-longer-running-ads-for-ice-130000672.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another first-party Xbox game is making the leap to PlayStation 5. This time around, Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em> — one of our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">favorite games of last year</a> — is crossing the great divide. The fantasy action RPG will hit Sony’s console <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-is-coming-to-playstation-5" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">on February 17</a>, one day shy of the game’s first anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>As it happens, an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/avowed-updated-roadmap" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">anniversary update</a> is set to go live on all platforms at the same time. This includes a new game+ mode (allowing those who have beaten the RPG to replay it with all their gear and upgrades from their previous run), a photo mode, a new weapon type and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Avowed</em> is set in the same universe as Obsidian’s Pillars of Eternity games. It tasks you with investigating a fungal plague that has infested the world. “The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant,&quot; Engadget senior reporter Jessica Conditt wrote. &quot;<em>Avowed</em> is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft has brought a string of first-party Xbox games to PS5 over the last couple of years, freeing them from console exclusivity. <em>Forza Horizon 5, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade II</em> and <em>Sea of Thieves </em>are among the games that have crossed over to PlayStation.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Old-school, upright vacuums left a lot to be desired, and cordless models are here to right many of those wrongs. These types of vacuums tend to be thinner, lighter and easy to maneuver around a home, and you don’t really have to sacrifice suction power anymore to get those benefits. Dyson isn’t your only option anymore either — like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from today. Variety is great, but it can also lead to decision fatigue and confusion.<br><br>We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the best cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which is the best cordless vacuum for you.</p>

However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the &quot;self&quot; part isn&#39;t really there — instead, there&#39;s a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It&#39;s convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well.</p>

But it&#39;s ultimately <em>just fine</em> in comparison to our top picks; it&#39;s not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it&#39;s just awkward) and it doesn&#39;t have the smoothest handling.</p>

The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-cordless-vacuum">Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design-and-bin-capacity">Design and bin capacity</h3> 
<p>Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices.</p> 
<p>Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners.</p> 
<p>Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session.</p> 
<p>If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-suction-and-power-modes">Suction and power modes</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power.</p> 
<p>Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength.</p> 
<p>Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible.</p> 
<p>If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-floor-type">Floor type</h3> 
<p>The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it&#39;s still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life">Battery life</h3> 
<p>Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-base-style">Base style</h3> 
<p>Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby.</p> 
<p>Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-smart-features">“Smart” features</h3> 
<p>Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area.</p> 
<p>Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">best robot vacuums</a>, or even the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">best budget robot vacuums</a>, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t <em>need</em> Wi-Fi or an app connectivity.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-cordless-vacuums">How we test cordless vacuums</h2> 
<p>Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-cordless-stick-vacuums-faqs">Cordless stick vacuums FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-does-the-battery-last-on-a-cordless-vacuum">How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum?</h3> 
<p>Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cordless-vacuums-be-as-powerful-as-corded-ones">Can cordless vacuums be as powerful as corded ones?</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuums do sacrifice a bit in overall power when compared to corded models, but that doesn’t mean they can’t handle everyday messes just as well. If suction power is your biggest concern, we recommend springing for a high-powered, high-end cordless vacuum since, typically, the more expensive a cordless vacuum is, the stronger the suction. Also, cordless vacuums have the edge over corded models when it comes to weight and convenience: cordless vacuums are much lighter than their corded counterparts, and you’ll never have to worry about placement or picking a fight with a cord while cleaning your living room.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-cordless-vacuums-effective-on-pet-hair">Are cordless vacuums effective on pet hair?</h3> 
<p>Yes, cordless vacuums can handle pet hair well, but we recommend getting a model with strong suction power to get the best results. It’s also wise to get one with a larger bin, since pet hair can quickly fill up smaller bins, which may force you to stop cleaning to empty the vacuum before finishing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-methods-for-maintaining-a-cordless-vacuum-cleaner">What are the best methods for maintaining a cordless vacuum cleaner?</h3> 
<p>Maintaining a cordless vacuum is super easy and helps to keep it running like new. First, make sure to empty the dustbin regularly — don’t let it overfill, as this can impact suction. Many models have washable filters, so rinse them out every few weeks (check your manual for specifics) and let them dry completely before putting them back.</p> 
<p>Next, take a look at the brush roll — hair and debris can get tangled up in there over time. Most vacuums make it simple to remove the brush roll, so you can snip away any tangles with scissors. If your vacuum has a replaceable battery, try not to let it fully drain too often, as this can reduce its lifespan. A quick wipe-down of the vacuum’s exterior and attachments will also keep everything looking fresh.</p> 
<p>Lastly, keep an eye on the sensors and charging contacts, as dust can build up there too. A gentle wipe with a dry cloth every now and then will do the trick.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cordless-vacuums-also-be-used-to-clean-curtains-and-upholstery">Can cordless vacuums also be used to clean curtains and upholstery?</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuums are surprisingly versatile, and many come with attachments specifically designed for surfaces like curtains, upholstery and even mattresses. A handheld vacuum mode, which is common in cordless models, makes it easy to tackle these areas. Look for a soft brush or an upholstery tool in the attachments for the vacuum you’re considering — it’ll help remove dust and pet hair without damaging fabrics. For curtains, it’s a good idea to use a lower suction setting if your vacuum has adjustable modes. This prevents the fabric from getting pulled into the nozzle.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lumus got a major boost in brand recognition when one of its waveguides was selected for use in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>. But that already feels like old tech now because at CES 2026, the company brought some of its latest components to the show and based on what I saw, they seem poised to seriously elevate the optical quality of the next wave of high-end smartglasses.&nbsp;</p><p>When the Meta Ray-Ban Displays glasses came out, they wowed users as they were (and still are) one of a handful of smartglassess to feature a full-color in-lens display with at least a 20-degree field of view. But going by the specs on Lumus’ newest waveguides, we’re set for a major upgrade in terms of future capabilities.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-wave-guide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-wave-guide.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses&#39; lenses." data-uuid="7f2fc40a-ee7f-46f3-a0e9-7f2abc7f4bba"/><figcaption>If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses&#39; lenses.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The first model I tried featured Lumus’ optimized Z-30 waveguides, which not only offer a much wider 30-degree FOV, they are also 30 percent lighter and 40 percent thinner than previous generations. On top of that, Lumus says they are also more power efficient with the waveguides capable of hitting more than 8,000 nits per watt. This is a big deal because smartglasses are currently quite limited by the size of batteries they can use, especially if you want to make them small and light enough to wear all day. When I tried them on, I was dazzled by both the brightness and sharpness I saw from the Z-30s despite them being limited to 720 x 720 resolution. Not only did the increase in FOV feel much larger than 10 degrees, colors were very rich, including white, which is often one of the most difficult shades to properly reproduce.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-70-fov-model.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-70-fov-model.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="I had to take a photo of one of Lumus&#39; non-functioning smartglasses with the company&#39;s 70-degree FOV waveguide, because two out of three of the working ones had already broke and the last one that I used was being held together by tape.

I was able to view some videos and a handful of test images and I was completely blown away with how much area they covered. It was basically the entire center portion of the lens, with only small unused areas around the corners. And while I did notice some pincushion distortion along the sides of the waveguide’s display, a Lumus representative told me that it will be possible to correct for that in final retail units. But make no mistake, these waveguides undoubtedly produced some of the sharpest, brightest and best-looking optics I’ve seen from any smartglasses, from either retail models or prototypes or. It almost made me question how much wider FOV these types of gadgets really need, though to be clear, I don’t think we’ve hit the point of diminishing returns yet.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/super-thin-waveguide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/super-thin-waveguide.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="This is one of Lumus&#39; thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm." data-uuid="9340a55b-ea8c-421b-9e82-4fa5b309dd58"/><figcaption>This is one of Lumus&#39; thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Other advantages of Lumus’ geometric reflective waveguides include better overall efficiency than their refractive counterparts along with the ability to optically bond the displays to smartglasses lenses. That means unlike a lot of rivals, Lumus’ waveguides can be paired with transitions lenses instead of needing to resort to clip-on sunglass attachments when you go outside. Lumus also claims its designs also simplifies the manufacturing process, resulting in thinner waveguides (as small as 0.8mm) and generally higher yields.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, taking high-quality photos of content from smartglasses displays is incredibly challenging, especially when you’re using extremely delicate prototypes, so you’ll just have to take my word for now.  But with Lumus in the process of ramping up production of its new waveguides with help from partners including Quanta and SCHOTT, it feels like there will be a ton of smartglasses makers clamoring for these components as momentum continues to build around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the industry’s pick for the next “big” thing.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/lumus-brought-a-massively-wider-fov-to-smartglasses-at-ces-2026-233245949.html?src=rss]]></description>

I&#39;ve always felt a bit self conscious at speaking to my glasses in public.&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, replying to messages on the display glasses has still generally required voice dictation or generic preset replies. But handwriting means that you can finally send custom messages and replies somewhat discreetly.&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting at a table wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and neural band, I was able to quickly write a message just by drawing the letters on the table in front of me. It wasn&#39;t perfect — it misread a capital &quot;I&quot; as an &quot;H&quot; — but it was surprsingly intuitive. I was able to quickly trace out a short sentence and even correct a typo (a swipe from left to right will let you add a space, while a swipe from right to left deletes the last character).&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ9IsB72nVk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Alongside handwriting, Meta also announced a new teleprompter feature. Copy and paste a bunch of text — it supports up to 16,000 characters (roughly a half-hour&#39;s worth of speech) — and you can beam your text into the glasses&#39; display.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever used a teleprompter, Meta&#39;s version works a bit differently in that the text doesn&#39;t automatically scroll while you speak. Instead, the text is displayed on individual cards you manually swipe through. The company told me it originally tested a scrolling version, but that in early tests, people said they preferred to be in control of when the words appeared in front of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Teleprompter is starting to roll out now, though Meta says it could take some time before everyone is able to access.&nbsp;</p><p>The updates are the among the first major additions Meta has made to its display glasses since launching them late last year and a sign that, like its other smart glasses, the company plans to keep them fresh with new features.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While wave upon wave of smartglasses and face-based wearables crash on the shores of CES, traditional glasses really haven’t changed much over the hundreds of years we’ve been using them. The last innovation, arguably, was progressive multifocals that blended near and farsighted lenses — and that was back in the 1950s. It makes sense that autofocusing glasses maker IXI thinks it’s time to modernize glasses.</p>
<p>After recently announcing a 22-gram (0.7-ounce) prototype frame, the startup is here in Las Vegas to show off working prototypes of its lenses, a key component of its autofocus glasses, which could be a game-changer.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IXI’s glasses are designed for age-related farsightedness, a condition that affects many, if not most people over 45. They combine cameraless eye tracking with liquid crystal lenses that automatically activate when the glasses detect the user’s focus shifting. This means that, instead of having two separate prescriptions, as in multifocal or bifocal lenses, IXI’s lenses automatically switch between each prescription. Crucially — like most modern smartglasses — the frames themselves are lightweight and look like just another pair of normal glasses.</p>

<p>With a row of prototype frames and lenses laid out in front of him, CEO and co-founder Niko Eiden explained the technology, which can be separated into two parts. First, the IXI glasses track the movement of your eyes using a system of LEDs and photodiodes, dotted around the edges of where the lenses sit. The LEDs bounce invisible infrared light off the eyes and then measure the reflection, detecting the subtle movements of your eye and how both eyes converge when focusing on something close.</p>
<p>Using infrared with just a &quot;handful of analog channels&quot; takes far less power than the millions of pixels and 60-times-per-second processing required by camera-based systems. IXI’s system not only tracks eye movements, but also blinking and gaze direction, while consuming only 4 milliwatts of power.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12d1bba0-ec27-11f0-bbbc-16c5fed13b32" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12d1bba0-ec27-11f0-bbbc-16c5fed13b32" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="IXI autofocus lenses" data-uuid="c25a9be8-a13b-31aa-84fc-453d028d5a89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Most of the technology, including memory, sensors, driving electronics and eye tracker, is in the front frame of the glasses and part of the arms closest to the hinge. The IXI prototype apparently uses batteries similar in size to those found in AirPods, which gives some sense of the size and weight of the tech being used. The charging port is integrated into the glasses’ left arm hinge. Naturally, this does mean they can’t be worn while charging. IXI says that a single charge should cover a whole day’s usage.</p>
<p>The prototype frames I saw this week appeared to be roughly the same weight as my traditional chunky specs. And while these are early iterations, IXI’s first frames wouldn’t look out of place in a lineup of spectacle options.</p>
<p>The team has also refined the nose pieces and glasses arms to accommodate different face shapes. Apparently, when testing expanded from Finland to the UK, British faces were “...different.” A little harsh when talking to me, a Brit.</p>
<p>Eiden pulled out some prototype lenses, made up of layers of liquid crystal and a transparent ITO (indium tin oxide) conductive layer. This combination is still incredibly thin, and it was amazing to watch the layers switch almost instantly into a prescription lens. It seemed almost magical. As they’re so thin, they can be easily integrated into lenses with existing prescriptions. It can also provide cylindrical correction for astigmatism too.</p>
<p>Autofocus lenses could eliminate the need for multiple pairs of glasses, such as bifocals and progressives. Even if the glasses were to run out of power, they’d still function as a pair of traditional specs with your standard prescription, just lacking the near-sighted boost. IXI’s sensor sensitivity can also offer insight into other health conditions, detect dry eyes, estimate attentiveness and, by tracking where you’re looking, even posture and neck movement. According to Eiden, blink rate changes with focus, daydreaming and anxiety, and all that generates data that can be shown in the companion app.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12da9540-ec27-11f0-87ed-a30e3c5b4845" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12da9540-ec27-11f0-87ed-a30e3c5b4845" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="IXI autofocus lenses" data-uuid="afc56c09-ccc5-3fb2-a787-2915237b51d6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Hypothetically, the product could even potentially adapt prescriptions dynamically, going beyond the simple vision correction of Gen 1. For example, it could offer stronger corrections as your eyes get fatigued through the day.</p>
<p>IXI appears to be putting the pieces in place to make these glasses a reality. It still needs to obtain the necessary medical certifications in order to sell its glasses and get all the production pieces in place. It’s already partnered with Swiss lens-maker Optiswiss for manufacturing. Eiden says the final product will be positioned as a high-end luxury glasses option, selling through existing opticians. The company hopes to finally launch its first pair sometime next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html?src=rss]]></description>

</div><p>But perhaps the biggest upgrade to the project is that instead of just Ava, who Razer describes as “a calm, reliable source of energy to help you keep things clear, efficient, and always on point,” there are three or four new personas (depending on how we’re counting) joining the roster. Kira looks like a TikTok e-girl decked out in a frilly outfit complete with Razer neon green accents, while Zane is her edgy masculine alternative who kind of reminds me of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.meming.world/wiki/Giga_Chad" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Giga Chad meme</a>, but with extra snake tattoos. Then there’s Sao, who appears to be directly inspired by iconic <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/japanese-salarywoman-saori-araki" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Japanese salary woman Saori Araki</a>. Finally, there’s an avatar made in the likeness of Faker (Lee Sang-hyeok), the most successful and well-known League of Legends player of all time and one of Razer&#39;s sponsored esports athletes.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-connected.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-connected.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion." data-uuid="b033651e-b4c3-4f15-970d-0ef496c4dd1e"><figcaption>The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The idea now is that instead of being trapped inside your computer, Ava or one of Razer’s other personas can sit on your desk and be your companion for everything. They can remind you of upcoming events, respond to questions or even comment on your outfit using Razer’s built-in camera. That said, if you need some privacy, the device’s mics can be muted and the company says its planning on putting a physical camera shutter on final retail models. Of course, Ava or any of the other avatars can still hang out while you game and give you advice. During my demo, Kira helped pick out a loadout in <em>Battlefield 6</em>  based on user criteria and even provided pros and cons for some of the game’s other equipment options.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/avatars.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/avatars.png" style="height:633px;width:1507px;" alt="Project Ava&#39;s expanded roster of AI companions" data-uuid="b918f479-ae59-431a-8ce7-833d6d12618b"><figcaption>Project Ava&#39;s expanded roster of AI companions</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, while I did get to see Kira and Zane talk, dance and sway in their little bottles, Sao and Faker weren’t quite ready to make their holographic debuts. But according to Razer, that’s sort of by design as Project Ava is very much a work in progress. Currently, the avatars’ responses are generated by X AI’s Grok (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">yikes!</a>), but the platform was created as a sort of open-source project that will support other models like Gemini or ChatGPT. </p><p>Down the line, Razer is hoping to add the ability for users to create their own unique avatars and companions based on their input or inspiration from real-world objects. Meanwhile, for avatars like Faker&#39;s because he’s also an actual person, Razer wants additional time to make the AI companion helpful with topics like real-time League of Legends coaching.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-zane.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-zane.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="Say hello to Giga Chad, I mean Zane.

And if you’re the kind of person who prefers digital companions over flesh-and-blood alternatives (you know, people), I guess it’s kind of nice to have a more tangible representation of your electronic waifus and husbandos.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/faker.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/faker.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="Faker&#39;s avatar was only viewable in this nearly life-size mock up.

Possibly the most exciting change is that Shorts are now listed as a content type, so the three-minute-or-less videos can be excluded as results in your searches. </p><p>This is a welcome update for any of us who have been on the hunt for a long-form explainer only to wade through dozens of ten-second clips before finding anything close to our goal. Especially with the addition of even more <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-is-adding-the-veo-3-video-generator-to-youtube-to-slopify-shorts-155339183.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">AI slop</a> last year thanks to the Google Veo 3 engine, an option to exclude Shorts may look even more appealing.</p><p>The other updates include a pair of renamed features within advanced search. The &quot;Sort By&quot; menu will now be called &quot;Prioritize.&quot; Likewise, the &quot;View Count&quot; option has been renamed to &quot;Popularity;&quot; this will allow YouTube&#39;s algorithms to account for other metrics such as watch time to gauge how much other users are engaging with a particular video. A pair of former filter options have also been removed; there will no longer be choices to search for &quot;Upload Date - Last Hour&quot; and &quot;Sort by Rating.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-will-let-you-exclude-shorts-from-search-results-204500097.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fender Audio may have announced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">new headphones and speakers</a> right before CES, but Las Vegas afforded us the first opportunity to see the brand’s new lineup in person. Fender Audio is a Fender-owned brand from Riffsound that’s designing and making new devices after licensing the name. It’s been a while since the guitar and amplifier company made any general-use speakers of its own, and this new arrangement is similar to what <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-20-marshall-updates-major-headphone-with-in-line-mic-for-more-talki.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Zound was doing with Marshall for a spell</a>. </p><p>Logistics out of the way, let’s get down to what the Mix and Ellie are like in the flesh. First, the Mix headphones offer a modular construction that allows you to replace nearly every piece as needed. The ear cups detach from the headband and the ear pads are replaceable. You can also swap out the battery, thanks to an easy-to-access slot behind one ear pad. And on the other side, a USB-C dongle for wireless lossless audio is stowed for safe keeping (wired lossless audio over USB-C is also available). </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Fender Audio Mix headphones" data-uuid="c9175cfb-32f0-4a57-9a22-cf0603105ae3"/><figcaption>Fender Audio Mix headphones</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fender Audio kept the controls simple on the Mix, opting for a single joystick for volume and playback changes. The joystick also serves as the power and pairing control as the only other button cycles through active noise cancellation (ANC) modes. In terms of sound, the Mix will satisfy listeners who crave deep bass, and vocals cut through clearly. In my brief demo, I would’ve liked more mid-range, but I’ll wait until I get a review unit for a full assessment there. I should mention the other standout feature is battery life: the Mix will offer up to 52 hours of use with ANC enabled (up to 100 hours with it off). </p><p>Then there are the Elie speakers. Both offer a similar set of features, which includes two wireless inputs for microphones (the company is working on its own model) and a combination XLR and 1/4-inch input for instruments. The Elie 06 is the smaller unit, housing a tweeter, full-range driver and subwoofer with 60 watts of output. The larger Elie 12 doubles all of that, serving as a more robust but still very portable option. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Fender Audio Ellie speakers" data-uuid="eabd1d5e-963f-4c92-abdb-8aab8fba9017"/><figcaption>Fender Audio Ellie speakers</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Both Elie units can be used in a single configuration or as a stereo pair. You can also connect up to 100 of the speakers via a Multi mode. Fender Audio has done a nice job here of checking all of the usual Bluetooth speaker boxes while offering something unique in terms all of those inputs. It’s like the company combined “regular” portable speakers with larger party boxes, offering something for customers who don’t want a massive device or any of the flashing lights. </p><p>Of course, none of these specs matter if the company didn’t ace the sound quality. While I’ll wait until I can spend several hours with some review units before I make any final judgement on these, I can tell you that both Elie speakers made a great first impression. There’s ample bass in the tuning for both, but obviously the larger Elie 12 offers more thump. Both units also provide excellent vocal clarity and nice details in the highs, as I made sure to select test tracks with lots of subtle sounds — like Bela Fleck’s banjo tunes. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-3.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speaker" data-uuid="55976e56-2bd8-4637-84bf-d2be1028642d"/><figcaption>The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speaker</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fender Audio says the arrival of the entire new lineup is imminent.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TVs are a staple of CES, and so far, manufacturers have not disappointed with their announcements at<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"> CES 2026</a>. Companies including Samsung, LG and others came to the event ready to show off updates to existing display tech and some genuinely new technologies. OLED and Mini LED remain central to most lineups, while<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"> Micro RGB</a> has emerged as one of the most talked-about developments at the show so far, especially at the higher end of the TV market.</p><p>Below are the TV announcements that stood out most from the pre-show events and early press conferences, with more expected as CES continues. Also, be sure to check out our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best of CES 2026</a> list.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-micro-rgb-tvs">Samsung Micro RGB TVs</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d.jpeg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d.jpeg" style="height:1732px;width:2400px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="3d2cc73b-d866-4d15-86d0-f4c3f2bbd879"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p><p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;cpos:4;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p><p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward.  </p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2><p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p><p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p><p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-evo-w6-wallpaper-tv">LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" style="height:1327px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV" data-uuid="c57ab13f-a9b0-4a6e-b9be-88d620777eda"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="slk:LG&#x002019;s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV;cpos:6;pos:1">LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</a> makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p><p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2><p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;cpos:7;pos:1">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p><p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p><p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2><p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p><p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p><h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2><p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p><p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p><p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p><p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-new-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-from-samsung-lg-and-tcl-190929614.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps you like the idea of controlling your home appliances with your voice, but aren’t super keen on a data center processing recordings of you. Fair enough. The trade-off for most smart home conveniences is relinquishing at least some of your privacy. Today at CES, I saw a line of voice-controlled home appliances from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://emersonsmart.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Emerson Smart</a> that adjust power and setting via voice commands. But commands are recognized on the devices themselves, not carried through Wi-Fi and processed elsewhere. </p>
<p>The huge array of smart plugs, fans, heaters and even air fryers require no app for setup and don’t need access to Wi-Fi. Instead, I said, “hey Emerson, lights on” or “hey fan, turn on low” and the devices in the demo space acted accordingly. A few of the devices combine the mic with a speaker and can respond when a command is received. </p>
<p>A bit of built-in programing on the air fryers allow them to understand commands for 100 cooking presets, so saying things like, “reheat this pizza” or “cook these frozen french fries” will set the correct mode, time and temp. Of course you can also just say, “cook at 350 degrees for 10 minutes” and it’ll comply. Most of the commands for the other items are pretty simple but allow you to do things like set a timer, turn on oscillation and set intensity speeds. </p>

<p>Some of the devices allow for a small amount of programmability. Pressing and holding the button on the smart plug, for example, changes the wake word to “plug two,” doing it again swaps it to “plug three,” and so on. That way, if you have more than one plug in a room, you can operate them individually. </p>
<p>The small demo space in which I talked to the devices (that did its best to shut out the thrumming noise of the CES show floor) had at least six models active and listening for my words. When I said “Hey Emerson,” both an air fryer and one of the heaters responded. That was one of the limitations that I could see with the devices: If you outfit your entire home in Emerson Smart gear, it might take some time to name and position everything so it works in a coherent way. The lack of an app means that programmability is limited, too. That’s the trade-off the privacy-conscious or app-averse user will have to make if they want to turn their lamp on and fan up when they walk into a room just by talking. </p>
<p>As the only offline, non-DIY voice-controlled lineup of appliances out there, you’re stuck with whatever design Emerson Smart thinks look good. Thankfully, the overall design is clean and modern, if a little basic. The upcoming models of air purifiers and fans were decidedly more attractive. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been almost two months since Fubo has stopped carrying NBCUniversal-owned channels, and there&#39;s still no sign of them coming back to the streaming service. Customers have had to find alternate methods of watching <em>Sunday Night Football</em>, all the latest episodes of the<em> Real Housewives </em>franchise, and so much more because of Fubo and NBCUniversal&#39;s contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21.&nbsp;</p>

That&#39;s a dollar per month. This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21.</p> 
<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an unabashed fan of electric vehicles, even I have to admit that most of them are pretty boring. Their smooth, quiet and calm demeanors don&#39;t offer much in the way of intrinsic personality, which has led to many brands slapping on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-ev6-gt-first-drive-video-050142389.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">outré designs</a> and fake engine sounds to try and dial up the excitement.</p><p>To that end, a pair of offerings coming soon from UK-based EV startup Longbow Motors looks to deliver exactly that. The Speedster and Roadster are high-performance electric machines built using advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs. Those motors and a bespoke design enable an astonishing curb weight of just 2,200 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>For comparison&#39;s sake, that&#39;s over 100 pounds less than a Mazda Miata, the current king of lightweight roadsters. Longbow brought just the Speedster to CES 2026, displaying it on the show floor at the Donut Lab booth. Donut is a spinoff of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-verge-ts-ultra-electric-motorcycle-is-entirely-too-fast-213302452.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Verge Motorcycles</a>, which was the debut platform for the company&#39;s hub-less electric motor, creating a unique, Tron-style aesthetic.</p><p>But the technology is about a lot more than creating physics-defying motorcycles. Donut Lab is expanding its motors to all sorts of platforms, from scooters to heavy-duty trucks, creating a platform for easy adoption by electrified startups.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_021.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_021.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Donut Labs&#39; motors in the Longbow Motors Speedster" data-uuid="60c33371-0460-4500-95b7-7476d37b26ca"/><figcaption>Donut Labs&#39; motors in the Longbow Motors Speedster</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>Of all those platforms, though, Longbow&#39;s implementation is the most compelling I&#39;ve seen. The appeal starts with the style. Co-founders Daniel Davey and Mark Tapscott (who, with Jenny Keisu, founded Longbow after stints at Tesla and Lucid) told me they wanted to offer a classic but also modern and compelling look. The roofless Speedster has an edge over its glass-topped Roadster in terms of visual simplicity, but a complete lack of any protection from the elements — even a token windscreen — will make it viable only for the most committed of open-air enthusiasts.</p><p>Exposed or protected, you&#39;ll find yourself situated in an extremely spartan interior. Things like the gauge cluster and primary controls were covered, set to be revealed later, so I can&#39;t say for sure exactly what the Longbow looks like on the inside. But it was designed to be basic and minimal to an extreme, an abject rejection of the rest of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">touchscreen-laden machines</a> on the road today.</p><p>There is one seemingly unnecessary piece of equipment in the interior, though, and that&#39;s a shift knob. EVs, of course, rarely have transmissions, so there&#39;s no outright need to shift. The purpose of that lever is also a mystery for now, as neither Davey nor Tapscott would confirm its function, but it seems safe to expect some sort of simulated gearshift action, <em>a la</em> the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-shows-off-its-high-performance-ioniq-5-n-ev-150053657.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</a>.</p><p>The Longbow machines don&#39;t just lack a transmission, they lack a traditional drivetrain layout at all. The direct-drive Donut Lab motors are situated right inside the wheel, freeing up space inside the vehicle&#39;s chassis and helping it to maintain its pert dimensions.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Longbow Motors Speedster" data-uuid="221cff0b-9ddd-4c0c-aa68-e34e9222b104"/><figcaption>Longbow Motors Speedster</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>They also provide a distinctive look, filling up the wheels as they do. There is a downside to this arrangement, that being the heft of these motors hanging on the outer edges of the vehicle. The suspension, then, has to work a bit harder. But co-founder Mark Tapscott told me that the positives outweigh the negatives, and that the handling benefits of having multiple motors alone are worth it.</p><p>To keep the rest of the Longbow&#39;s weight centralized, the car uses a battery pack that runs largely along the center of the machine, stacked vertically rather than spread throughout the floor. This keeps the mass centralized in the vehicle while also enabling the kind of ultra-low seating you want in a machine like this.</p><p>It looks like it&#39;ll be quite a fun package to drive, and while exact power output from those Donut Lab motors hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet, the Speedster is said to sprint to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. That&#39;s supercar-like performance, but unfortunately, that performance won&#39;t come cheap.&nbsp;</p><p>The Speedster starts at ₤84,995, or just under $100,000 by current conversion rates. The Roadster is a fair bit more attainable at ₤64,995, or about $75,000. However, given the wonderfully chaotic state of international tariffs right now, expect the actual pricing here to be somewhat higher when they go into production later this year. Reservations are open now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://longbowmotors.com/#configure" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">on the company&#39;s site</a>.</p><p>That&#39;s a little too rich for my blood, sadly, but if you&#39;ve got the budget, a left-hand drive version will be available. And yes, it&#39;ll be fully road-legal in the U.S.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ces-2026-longbow-motors-shows-off-its-speedster-ev-with-donut-labs-in-wheel-motors-192329111.html?src=rss]]></description>

On Thursday, FIFA said its media partners will be able to broadcast “parts of matches” on the social platform. The “preferred platform” partnership will run through the end of 2026.</p><p>How long the live clips will be is anyone’s guess because “parts of matches” is as specific as the announcement got. We emailed TikTok for clarification and will update this story if we learn more.</p><p>FIFA said the collaboration is designed to bring fans &quot;closer to the action.” Getting more to the point, TikTok&#39;s global head of content said live sports on the platform are shown to transform “fandom into measurable business results for our sports partners, with fans being 42 percent more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok.”</p><p>TikTok’s World Cup content will include filters, stickers and other “gamification” features. FIFA will also give “a select group of global TikTok creators” access to press conferences and training sessions to create content. &quot;As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted,&quot; FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom wrote in the announcement.</p><p>The World Cup runs from June 11 to July 19. It will take place in 16 cities across Canada, the US and Mexico.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-will-broadcast-some-unknown-portion-of-the-2026-world-cup-live-192035507.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted to save approximately three seconds and two mouse clicks when shopping online? Microsoft has something special just for you. The company just introduced something called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/january-2026/conversations-that-convert-copilot-checkout-and-brand-agents"><ins>Copilot Checkout</ins></a> at the NRF 2026 retail conference. This is exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s a shopping assistant embedded within Copilot.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out now in the US and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2026-01-08-PayPal-Powers-Microsofts-Launch-of-Copilot-Checkout"><ins>integrates with PayPal</ins></a>, Shopify, Stripe and Etsy. It lets people complete purchases directly inside of Copilot without having to withstand the grueling experience of being redirected to a retailer&#39;s website. Participating partners include Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Ashley Furniture.</p>

<p>The retailers remain the actual merchant of record, so they&#39;ll still get customer data and all of that jazz. Microsoft controls the interface.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know what kind of safeguards are in place to prevent the AI from hallucinating its way into buying you a giant bounce house when you wanted to order some Bounce dryer sheets. Engadget has reached out to Microsoft to inquire about these safeguards and how exactly the money is handled.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big moment for AI shopping. OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-now-offers-a-dedicated-shopping-assistant-180000034.html"><ins>introduced a shopping assistant</ins></a> several months ago that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/"><ins>seems to work in a similar way</ins></a>. However, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-now-offers-a-dedicated-shopping-assistant-180000034.html"><ins>said that</ins></a> a related shopping assistant &quot;might make mistakes about product details like price and availability&quot; and it encouraged people to visit the merchant site for the most accurate details.</p>
<div id="e17fbb68a5bd47069f66852887879ec2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: OpenAI’s push to turn ChatGPT into a personal shopping assistant is running into a familiar problem: messy product data.<br><br>Read more from <a href="https://twitter.com/anngehan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnnGehan</a> 👇 <a href="https://t.co/atPdY1ruEa">https://t.co/atPdY1ruEa</a></p>— The Information (@theinformation) <a href="https://twitter.com/theinformation/status/2009272415730159641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft is advertising Copilot Checkout as a way to avoid the merchant site entirely, so maybe all kinks have been worked out. A recent report <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Information;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=347d04fc-65ea-4c2c-a312-96af854517ea&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;linkText=from+The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvb3BlbmFpcy1zaG9wcGluZy1hbWJpdGlvbnMtaGl0LW1lc3N5LWRhdGEtcmVhbGl0eSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzQ3ZDA0ZmMtNjVlYS00YzJjLWEzMTItOTZhZjg1NDUxN2VhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvb3BlbmFpcy1zaG9wcGluZy1hbWJpdGlvbnMtaGl0LW1lc3N5LWRhdGEtcmVhbGl0eSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQMyoGLdrXio7IP31FspkvUNmq1KVtgjVQGdR76SxtvT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fopenais-shopping-ambitions-hit-messy-data-reality" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-shopping-ambitions-hit-messy-data-reality"><ins>from </ins><em><ins>The Information</ins></em></a> suggests OpenAI has had trouble integrating merchant partners for its own initiative, so maybe not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that automatic shopping isn&#39;t exactly a new concept. It&#39;s just the AI wrapper that&#39;s new.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cute, alien-inspired companion <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/the-robots-we-saw-at-ces-2025-the-good-the-bad-and-the-completely-unhinged-174529774.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">robots are a fixture at CES</a>, but have I ever seen one with a furry telescoping neck that&#39;s also warm to the touch? No, I can&#39;t say I have before this year. OlloBot — which had possibly the cutest booth at CES 2026 — is a home robot and &quot;cyber pet&quot; that looks something like if you put ET&#39;s head on a penguin&#39;s body, plus a splash of fur and color.&nbsp;</p><p>Its face is essentially a large tablet that displays its expressions, pictures and videos, and allows it to communicate with people in the home. OlloBot speaks its own language, but will put text on the screen when it has a message that&#39;s meant to actually be understood. There&#39;s also a companion app where family members can message with the robot, see its diary updates and play games. Like other family-oriented robots, OlloBot is designed to capture special moments and &quot;grow&quot; with the people using it. </p><div><div><div id="c2df2a6ac9934af1b0d17dcdce6bc7fd"><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/NuaS1RUL?app=1" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Based on the interactions, it will over time develop a personality based on the Meyers-Briggs personality types. The robot responds to voice and touch, and can do tasks like make calls and help find lost objects. It will be able to control Matter-compatible smart home devices, too.&nbsp;All data is stored locally in a heart-shaped removable module underneath one of its flapping arms. Not only is that intended to be a privacy move, but if the robot ever breaks, the family&#39;s cyber pet (along with its &quot;memories&quot;) can be restored by putting the old heart into a new body.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/heart.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/heart.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A hand is seen lifting OlloBot&#39;s arm to reveal a red heart underneath, which serves as a removable module that contains its data" data-uuid="2d9974d9-8466-4c00-8260-e2d33cd1c7ae"><figcaption>OlloBot&#39;s heart</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p>According to a member of the OlloBot team, a Kickstarter campaign to fund the robot&#39;s production is planned for this summer. There will be two versions of OlloBot to choose from: a small one with a fixed, short neck that will cost around $1,000 and a more advanced model that can extend its neck by two feet or so (just eyeballing it) to see from different vantage points, which will run you about $2,000. At the booth, the team also showed off several outfits for OlloBot, including a plush giraffe suit and a sort of cottagecore apple and gingham outfit.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s a discount of 55 percent from the retail price of $100. It&#39;s a compelling opportunity to stock up if you&#39;re already in Samsung&#39;s ecosystem.</p>

<p>We named the SmartTag 2 the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html"><ins>best Bluetooth tracker</ins></a> for Samsung devices. The companion SmartThings Find app is easy to use, showing locations on a Google Maps-based interface. Much like Apple&#39;s Find My network, the location of a SmartTag is pinpointed using nearby Samsung phones. While nothing can beat the sheer size of Apple&#39;s tracking infrastructure given the number of iPhones in the US, it still worked well in our tests.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The SmartTag 2&#39;s design is more practical than some competitors since the oblong fob has a built-in hole that lets you easily attach your keys without buying an extra accessory. It’s IP67 rated for water and dust resistance, and uses a replaceable battery that Samsung says offers about 16 months of juice. The volume on the tag is pretty loud and users can select from multiple ringtones. Additionally, a double-squeeze of the SmartTag 2 will ping your handset, something you can&#39;t do with an AirTag.</p> 
<p>The tracking is not quite as precise as Apple&#39;s AirTag, but it&#39;s a solid option for Samsung users looking to keep track of their things and can be scooped up at a bargain price.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever bought a bag of spinach only to come home and realize you already had a bag of spinach, you may appreciate this fridge. I had a chance to check out the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ge-appliances-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326073.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">GE Profile Smart Fridge</a> with Kitchen Assistant <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">at CES</a> and was surprised to find I kinda wanted one. To be perfectly honest, most attempts I’ve seen at the show to “stick some AI in it” are at best amusing but usually completely unnecessary. </p>
<p>Here, though, the AI has a purpose. After seeing how the autofill water dispenser worked, I asked the GE Appliance reps how easy it was to change the fridge’s water filter. Jason May, a GE Appliances product management executive, walked up to the fridge’s (appropriately sized) touchscreen and said “Hey HQ, where’s my water filter?” (HQ is short for SmartHQ, GE Profile’s assistant). Then, relying on information it had gathered from this model’s user manual, the AI assistant explained exactly where to find it (in the left hand door below the ice maker). It took another rep about two seconds to pop out the filter and, justlikethat, the task was on its way to done. </p>
<p>As for the spinach conundrum, that’s handled by a crisper drawer camera, called Fridge Focus. Each time you open the drawers, a built-in camera (that you can physically shutter or turn off in the app) takes a video snapshot of what’s left when you’re done. So if you’re at the store and wondering how much kale you already have, you can take a peek and see. </p>

<p>Wendy Treinen, GE Appliances’ senior director of product communications, told me the camera can see what’s in the crisper drawer, but can’t see who accessed it. So if you’re hoping your fridge will rat out whoever at the last of the grapes, you’re out of luck. It can however, help that grape-eater easily add more fruit to the family shopping list. </p>
<p>That’s the most unique feature the fridge offers: a patented, built-in barcode scanner. It lives in the water dispenser and when you walk up, a little green light activates and scans the barcode of whatever you hold up to it. So if you’re drinking the last of the almond milk, you scan the container and it’ll automatically add it to your list. </p>
<p>That list can be accessed through the SmartHQ app which you can either check off at the grocery store or, if you really want to get deluxe about it, use the Instacart integration and have it delivered to your door. I scanned a few products — a box of vitamin C mix and a package of cinnamon raisin bagels — both of which quickly popped up on the screen and joined the running list. </p>

<p>The scanner can recognize four million products, including household items like paper towels and trash bags, but you can add things a other ways too. The easiest is probably just asking your fridge to do so, saying “Hey HQ, add paper towels to my shopping list.” The app allows manual additions and you can add items using the recipe function as well. </p>
<p>For the launch of the fridge, GE Profile has partnered with Taste of Home and will send 50 recipes each month to the fridge for users to try. Once you see the ingredients list, you can add anything you’re missing to your shopping. Those 50 recipes will cycle out at the end of the month to make way for a new 50, so if you cook something and like it, you’ll need to to add it to your personal recipe vault. </p>
<p>The AI assistant can also create recipes for you. The GE rep snapped a picture of an array of produce and asked SmartHQ what he could make with it. A list of recipe suggestions popped up and they all looked quite tasty (to be fair, I hadn’t eaten yet and it was already 2PM). </p>

<p>I mentioned the water dispenser’s hands-free auto-fill feature earlier. That’s been available on GE Profile fridges for a while and lets you select your glass capacity and walk away while it fills. You can also ask for, say, a half cup of water for a recipe. A new “precise fill” feature will dispense larger amounts in sequence. Say you need ten cups of water for soup. Since you can’t fit a huge vat in the water dispenser tray, you can instead use a smaller jug and the auto-filler will fill it the correct amount of times. </p>
<p>Another of my favorite bits is the screen. Fridges with giant, interactive screens make my eyes roll. Yes, it’s novel and eye-catching and perhaps amusing, but what possible problem is it trying to solve? The screen here is eight inches, which is enough to display scanned items, show recipes, and display the weather atop a pretty image when you’re not actively using the interface. </p>

<p>The GE Appliances reps were eager to point out that this is just the beginning of what they want to do with the fridge. My college Sam Rutherford asked whether the fridge would be able to alert you before your lettuce went bad, and we were told something that addresses that problem is on the horizon. It would likely work by recognizing when you purchased a perishable, and how long that perishable typically lasts. The company is also working with a chef on a feature that can reimagine your leftovers to create something new. </p>
<p>During the demo, May told me that the whole idea around the fridge’s design was to do something other than just “put a big screen on it with a bunch of apps that don’t have ay relevance to anything.” Instead the engineers started with problems people actually have — knowing what to buy at the store, knowing what’s already in the fridge, answering the eternal, unrelenting “What’s for dinner?” question — and designed the fridge around that. </p>
<p>I’d have to live with it a while to know whether those problems were solved, but so far, I can say this is the most intrigued I’ve felt about a smart fridge yet. The GE Profile Smart Fridge with Kitchen Assistant will be available in March from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6efa3bd-7e88-4c77-b015-37f6878ef85a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=db978eac-7f71-4bf4-9e8d-cb69745a0108&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GE+Appliances+Parts&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vZ2VhcHBsaWFuY2VzLmNvbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGI5NzhlYWMtN2Y3MS00YmY0LTllOGQtY2I2OTc0NWEwMTA4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vZ2VhcHBsaWFuY2VzLmNvbSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdjJY6bOEIM3Gw6Ubf_kBIdI7nVXdvWOepIIl5rMjB82&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fgeappliances.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:GE Appliances Parts;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="http://geappliances.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">geappliances.com</a> for $4,899. </p>

We <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-killing-the-xps-name-is-an-unforced-error-200006195.html" data-i13n="slk:said so;cpos:2;pos:1">said so</a>, in fact, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html" data-i13n="slk:multiple;cpos:3;pos:1">multiple</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html" data-i13n="slk:times;cpos:4;pos:1">times</a>. But at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company is righting its past wrongs by resurrecting the iconic laptop brand — and this time, this decision feels like the right move both for Dell as a whole and its flagship consumer devices.</p><p>Even more than the words the letters XPS are meant to represent (Extreme Performance Systems), over the last decade, Dell’s signature laptop brand stood for excellent design, quality engineering and top notch performance. And it was precisely those laptops that landed the company at the top of nearly every best Windows laptop guide every year for the last decade. So to replace XPS with a generic tag like premium felt like a big step backwards.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Now if you were living under a rock (at least when it comes to Windows laptops), you can sort of squint your eyes and see the reasoning behind Dell’s misguided rebranding. Premium means good, typically something much better than average. By putting that word in front of its top-tier systems, there’s no way anyone could be confused about what kind of device they were buying, right? Take for example the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Dell Premium 14</a>, which was the new moniker for what was previously called the XPS 14. A laptop like that has to be decent. I mean, it’s right there in the product name. The issue is that XPS already meant good. Actually, way better than that, if we were just going by the sheer number of accolades previous-gen models got, like Dell’s 2020-era machines which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">we called practically perfect</a> (which it was). Going away from that wasn’t just reductive, it was throwing the best part of Dell’s consumer business in the trash for no real reason.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The first two new XPS machines will be the XPS 14 and XPS 16.

COO Jeff Clarke was refreshingly honest about this when announcing the return of XPS at a CES media preview in early December. Not only did Dell lose its signature XPS brand last year, it actually made things more confusing for consumers when it simultaneously created a full range of Dell Pro and Pro Max systems. Unlike Apple’s MacBook Pros and iPhone Pro Maxes, those devices were actually meant for enterprise customers instead of regular Joes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16-2.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Another photo of the new XPS 14 and 16, which have a bunch of welcome changes and then some.

That left a lot of people turning to more <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-16-plus-2-in-1-review-technically-proficient-but-lacking-soul-153003908.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">expensive mid-range “Plus” systems</a> or waiting for a proper redesign of its top tier Premium laptops, which weren’t expected to arrive until 2026 anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>So where is Dell going from here? Well as Clarke put it quite succinctly, “We’re getting back to our roots.” Starting in 2026, the company is planning to create its broadest PC portfolio ever including, a full line of XPS laptops. This includes an all-new version of the XPS 13, which is going to be the thinnest and lightest model to date, along with complete overhauls for the XPS 14 and XPS 16. But Dell isn’t stopping there because on a slide it showed at its press event, there were two additional placeholders for future XPS systems coming at some later date.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-13-teaser-pic.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-13-teaser-pic.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Dell wouldn&#39;t let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here&#39;s a teaser it provided for CES. " data-uuid="c1a63d5a-a52d-4969-9e96-3f94eaab1489"><figcaption>Dell wouldn&#39;t let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here&#39;s a teaser it provided for CES. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Even when it comes to specific features and components on individual models, Dell is finally acknowledging some of the criticism it has received over the past few years by returning to segmented touchpads instead of seamless all-glass slates and ditching capacitive function keys for good ‘ol buttons. Dell isn’t just bringing the XPS line back, it’s kind of on a revenge tour (even if the original wound was self-inflicted).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the consumer device team will be reporting directly to Clarke while the company retools itself internally. Dell is also updating its naming scheme to finally deliver on the promise of making things clear and simple. XPS will once again be the company’s flagship consumer brand with the XPS logo (not Dell’s) front and center on the lid of every laptop, while everything else will fall under the general Dell umbrella. Alienware will continue to do its own thing for gaming and the Dell Pro family will remain aimed strictly at enterprise businesses, professional services (like first responders) and education. No more confusion. And underlying all of that is a very straightforward motto from Clarke that “great products win.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EMBARGOED_UNTIL_JAN._5_%40_3pm_PT_-_Dell_Technologies_Branding_Snapshot.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EMBARGOED_UNTIL_JAN._5_%40_3pm_PT_-_Dell_Technologies_Branding_Snapshot.png" style="height:622px;width:1216px;" alt="After ditching the XPS brand, Dell is now bring it back for 2026 in its rightful spot at the top of the company&#39;s consumer portfolio.

Regardless of whether it&#39;s a corporation or a single person, admitting mistakes is always hard. Oftentimes, what you learn in the process is the real prize and from what I’ve seen Dell and its iconic XPS line is poised for a major comeback.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-in-2026-233248065.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Star Trek is in a weird place right now. Less than three years ago we were living in a golden age with five shows on the air, all with different styles and intended audiences.&nbsp; But the universe rapidly contracted, with <em>Picard</em> ending while four other shows were cut short. <em>Strange New Worlds</em> still has another two seasons left, sure, but even that final season got truncated. As it stands, there’s only one project with a firm future right now, and that’s a brand-new show, <em>Starfleet Academy</em>, premiering January 15 on Paramount+.</p><p>How this show is received could very well determine the future of Star Trek. That’s a lot to put on it, but there’s something very appropriate given the subject matter. <em>Starfleet Academy</em> takes place in the 32nd century, 900 years after the adventures of James T. Kirk and company, and it takes place at the titular academy, meaning its principal cast is a collection of teens representing the next generation of Starfleet officers. That focus on a younger cadre has led to fans online derisively calling the series “CW Trek” without seeing a single episode.&nbsp;</p><p>As <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is technically a <em>Discovery</em> spinoff, it picks up some of that series’ traits. The sleek, shiny sets are back, as well as a few plot threads originally set up in <em>Discovery</em>. The most notable is the collapse of the United Federation of Planets and the rebuilding of both the Federation and Starfleet. In fact, the series picks up on that as early as its second episode, with the Academy hosting a delegation from a once stalwart Federation planet that’s now gone isolationist.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_102_BP_1004_0320_RT_7636.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_102_BP_1004_0320_RT_7636.jpg" style="height:1843px;width:3000px;" alt="Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy" data-uuid="650975dd-226c-4232-9b2d-37029eaa2a5d"/><figcaption>Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Medland/Paramount+</div></figure><p>While many complaints about the series have focused on how what fans wanted was an academy show set during the 24th century (the time of <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, et al.), this particular episode plot works precisely because of the distant future in which it is set. In a fully-functioning galactic democracy like the United Federation of Planets, there’s no logical reason for the average 18-year-old college freshman to be involved in interplanetary diplomacy. But in the 32nd century, the Federation is a lot scrappier and the individuals involved might be asked to wear many hats. It’s a lot like an early-stage tech startup.</p><p>The setting also lets the show be a little more creative with its cast: where TNG featured the first Klingon in Starfleet (Worf), 900 years of progress have created a Starfleet where no one bats an eye when a Klingon cadet like Jay-Den Kraag (played by Karim Diané) shows up to study science. There’s also a holographic cadet, Sam, who is the first of her kind to attend the academy (and she’s super excited to do so). A few new species are present as well: Darem Reymi (George Hawkins) is a Khionian and Genesis Lythe (Bella Shepard) is a Dar-Sha, both aliens making their debut in the Star Trek universe.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_JM_1030_2840_RT.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_JM_1030_2840_RT.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="The cast of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy" data-uuid="dd590b7e-1c99-450d-a706-963a16e6e80c"/><figcaption>The cast of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Medland/Paramount+</div></figure><p>However, the show does still lean on some Trek stalwarts, and it’s these characters that have gotten the most chatter from fans. Mary Weisman as Sylvia Tilly was originally slated for the cast, and there was even a backdoor pilot-esque episode of <em>Discovery</em> to tie her in to the new show, but she’s no longer a regular and is nowhere to be seen in the first two episodes. Instead, we have Jett Reno (played by the wonderful Tig Notaro) as supporting cast, and Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) appearing in a few episodes. And old school fans have been abuzz by the inclusion of The Doctor, who first appeared on <em>Voyager</em> (and later <em>Prodigy</em>). As a hologram, he’s practically immortal so his presence doesn’t need any convoluted explanation, and after 800 years he’s still the same gregarious blowhard (and it’s delightful).</p><p>They’re joined by new characters like Lara Thok, a part Klingon, part Jem’Hadar security officer and a Lanthanite chancellor, Nahla Ake, played by Academy Award Winner Holly Hunter. And Hunter isn’t even the only Oscar winner on the cast, with a major villain, Nus Braka, being portrayed by Paul Giamatti.</p><p>It’s a stellar cast, and the show’s sets certainly rise up to meet the challenge. Like in the shows of old, a good portion of <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is clearly shot on location, though not in the familiar water reclamation plant that was used back during the TNG and DS9 era. This time it’s all being shot in Ontario, with the outdoor scenes in particular being filmed in Waterloo. Regardless of where it’s shot, it looks enough like sunny California to work.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_BP_1029_0373_RT.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_BP_1029_0373_RT.jpg" style="height:1924px;width:3000px;" alt="Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy" data-uuid="d9d7bb22-2bc8-4dbc-a251-945868cb5dc9"/><figcaption>Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Medland/Paramount+</div></figure><p>The indoor scenes, shot at Toronto’s Pinewood Studios, have a pleasant convention center quality to them, with lots of wide hallways and large windows in contrast to <em>Discovery</em>’s cramped ship corridors. The hallways are full of students and teachers going to and fro, including some from species that would normally be off-limits to a show with a limited budget. But here robots and strange aliens roam freely in the background. The CGI can’t have been cheap.</p><p>And that’s ultimately my biggest question about <em>Starfleet Academy</em>. Exactly how much is this costing Paramount? So much of it is being shot on real sets instead of green screens, established actors like Hunter and Giamatti couldn’t have been cheap, and plentiful CG points to a robust special effects budget. Though Paramount doesn’t release official numbers, estimates have put an average episode of <em>Strange New Worlds</em> at $10 million, so it figures that <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is probably more than that, with some online estimates as high as $20 million per episode.&nbsp;</p><p>With 10 episodes scheduled, that’s on par with a major motion picture budget but without the promise of blockbuster box office returns. No wonder Paramount has been doing so much cost-cutting, which includes axing every other Star Trek show.</p><p>That said, <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is carrying a lot on its shoulders. Just as the success or failure of its class of Starfleet cadets will determine the future of Starfleet and the Federation, the success of the show may even affect whether this era of Star Trek continues. As a Star Trek fan, this can be nerve-wracking; no one wants the franchise to go dormant again. But <em>Starfleet Academy</em> has so far shown itself to be up to the challenge.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/star-trek-starfleet-academy-deftly-balances-teen-drama-with-intergalactic-intrigue-170253808.html?src=rss]]></description>
