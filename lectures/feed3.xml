                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a month after the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">debut of Gemini 3 Pro</a> in November, Google has begun rolling out the more efficient Flash version of its latest AI model. According to the company, the new system offers similar &quot;pro-grade&quot; reasoning performance as its flagship model at a fraction of the cost, making it ideal for everyday use.&nbsp;</p><p>In benchmarks, the new system performed significantly better than Google&#39;s previous generation models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro. More notably, in Google’s testing it managed to trade blows with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">GPT-5.2</a>, the model OpenAI rushed out to counter Gemini 3 Pro.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/gemini-3-flash_final_benchmark-table_light_25-12-17_%282%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/gemini-3-flash_final_benchmark-table_light_25-12-17_%282%29.gif" style="height:1408px;width:1210px;" alt="A table comparing Gemini 3 Flash&#39;s performance across a variety of AI benchmarks.

In a handful of other benchmarks, Google&#39;s more efficient system even managed to outperform OpenAI&#39;s latest. For instance, in MMMU-Pro, a benchmark designed to test a model&#39;s multimodal understanding and reasoning, it edged out GPT-5.2 with a result of 81.2 percent compared to 79.5 percent. Of course, benchmarks only tell a partial story; we&#39;ll have to see what people think once both systems are broadly available. Still, the fact Gemini 3 Flash is even close to GPT-5.2, and the &quot;Extra High&quot; reasoning mode at that, is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-house-of-cards-seems-primed-to-collapse-170000900.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">worrying sign for OpenAI</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with Gemini 3 Pro, Google is rolling out the new model to both the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash-gemini-app/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Gemini App</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-ai-mode-update-gemini-3-flash" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI Mode in Search</a> where it will be the default model for both services. &quot;That means all of our Gemini users globally will get access to the Gemini 3 experience at no cost, giving their everyday tasks a major upgrade,&quot; Google explains.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know what you're thinking, didn't OnePlus release a new phone just last month? It did. A little over five weeks after the announcement of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">OP15</a>, the company is back with the OnePlus 15R, a more affordable version of its new flagship that starts at $700 (or $200 less than its sibling). Off the top, this will be a shorter review because most of what I said about the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OnePlus 15</a> also applies to the OP15R. It's a great phone that asks you to make one pretty significant compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the OnePlus 15, the 15R looks like the OnePlus 13s and 13T, a pair of smaller, 6.32-inch phones the company released in India and China this past spring. I said the design of the OP15 was boring and derivative of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The 15R has done nothing to change that opinion. With one fewer camera, the OP15R doesn't look much different from the iPhone 12 I've been hanging on to since 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I'm more fond of the 15R's mint breeze color (the phone is also available in charcoal black) than the sand storm shade of my OP15. We're big fans of minty phones here at Engadget, and OnePlus has gone with a particularly pleasing hue of the color with its new phone. With the redesign, OnePlus has also improved the phone's waterproofing, bringing it in line with the OP15. The new handset is IP69K-certified against moisture and dust, meaning it can withstand heated water shot at it at pressure. Like the OP15, the 15R trades OnePlus' old Alert Slider for a new Plus Key. It functions like the iPhone's Action button, allowing you to add a shortcut for a favorite feature. For example, you can configure it to open the camera app or act as a do not disturb toggle, among a few other options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One departure from the OP15 is that the 15R has a larger 6.83-inch display, making it slightly taller than its sibling. OnePlus is marketing this as one reason buyers might pick the 15R over the OP15, but holding the phones side by side, there's not much difference between the two. They're both big, and you'll either like that or won't.</p>
<p>On top of being big, the 15R's screen can refresh at a fast 165Hz in games. The two displays are also comparable in terms of resolution and brightness; both can push 1,800 nits of brightness. One difference I noticed is the OnePlus 15 has a warmer panel, even when the two phones are set to the same colorspace. I've reached out to OnePlus to find what might be causing the disparity, but for now it may be due to a quality control issue or oversight in the company's software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing, OnePlus has upgraded the 15R to add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor beneath the screen. This is placed in a nice spot toward the bottom third of the display, and it's fast and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OnePlus 15R is the first phone in North America to arrive with Qualcomm's latest <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-snapdragon-8-gen-5-is-a-cut-down-version-of-qualcomms-flagship-elite-chipset-063050786.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset</a>. Not to be confused with the Snapdragon Gen 5 Elite in the OP15, this new chipset is similar to Qualcomm's flagship system-on-a-chip but has a weaker CPU and GPU. This is reflected in benchmarks like Geekbench 6 where the OP15 handily outperforms the OP15R. It's not even close, either, with the OP15 delivering standout single- and multi-core scores of 3,773 and 11,293, while the 15R put up more modest results of 2,857 and 9,512.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that perspective, you're losing a fair amount of performance, but real-world use tells a different story. Outside of the handful of games such as <em>Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG</em> that support the OP15 and 15R's 165Hz displays, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 offers more than enough muscle for the majority of applications.&nbsp;Even for most games (like the ones I like to play, including <em>Diablo Immortal</em> and <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>), the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is a great match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OnePlus also hasn't skimped on the 15R's other internal components. You're still getting 12GB of LPDDR5X Ultra RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage. That's the same configuration as the base model of the OP15. This translates to a phone that doesn't miss a beat when switching between apps and loading files like images and videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15R has a slightly bigger battery, coming in at 7,400mAh, up from 7,300mAh on the OP15. In practice, the two phones offer the same amount of battery life. Putting them through both Engadget's video rundown test, they both ran for 38 hours before their batteries died (which makes sense given the OP15R has a bigger screen). Like the OP15, the 15R comes with the OnePlus 55W SUPERVOOC charger in the box. The adapter can get the 15R from dead to 100 percent in less than an hour. If you hate charging your phone, the 15R makes that process as painless as possible, with a battery that both lasts long and won't be at the outlet for hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By this point you're probably wondering what OnePlus cut from the OP15 to make the 15R more affordable. The answer — quite literally — is an entire camera. The new phone is missing a telephoto camera, something you could find on its predecessor, the OnePlus 13R. And as far as I can tell, the two remaining cameras use the same 50-megapixel and 8MP sensors OnePlus shipped on last year's model. The company also hasn't upgraded the glass on either camera. That leaves the selfie camera as the only area to see some change in the form of a sharper 32MP sensor and the addition of autofocus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b702c679-611b-45da-9084-c515bc9fd649" />
<p>Unfortunately, none of the 15R's cameras stand out. As a whole, they suffer from the same set of problems that plague the OnePlus 15's cameras. They're fine out on a sunny day, but as soon as the light becomes a bit challenging, the 15R struggles with shadow details, resulting in muddy pictures. The more I've used both the OP15 and 15R, the more I've come to the conclusion that OnePlus needs to go back to the drawing board with its new Detail Max Engine. It feels like it's holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware.</p>

<p>There's not much to say here other than the 15R ships with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/oxygenos-16-has-new-lock-screen-customization-options-and-a-novel-gemini-integration-184958404.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">OxygenOS 16</a>, just like the OP15. OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That's a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It's hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R's processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company's newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don't care about photos and videos. That's the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you're a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company's devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn't too impressed with the OP15's camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you're getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">other phones in its price range</a>, such as the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Pixel 10</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, the 15R is not as well-rounded, and can't compete with those devices in camera quality, but you're getting much better performance, battery life and a display they can't match. &nbsp; </p>

While keeping your IP address invisible, you can use your VPN to explore streaming content from all over the world or (virtually) sneak into a sports event that&#39;s not available in your area.</p><p>However, while VPNs are widely available, there&#39;s a strange dearth of information on what they actually do behind the scenes. You may know that a VPN masks your device with a proxy server to make it look like you&#39;re somewhere else, and maybe even that encryption is involved. But finding any more details can mean running a gauntlet of misinformation.</p><p>That&#39;s a shame, because the inner workings of a VPN aren&#39;t all that difficult to understand. You may not be able to build one yourself without a degree in computer science, but with a little work, you can understand exactly what it&#39;s doing on your computer. That&#39;s information you can use to select the right VPN for you, and make the most of it once you&#39;ve got it.</p><h2 id="70cde443-d9f2-456a-93b4-59c0b8e7b82a"><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></h2><p>To make sure nobody gets left behind, I&#39;ll start from the beginning. A VPN (virtual private network) is a method of securely accessing a network, either a closed network (like you might have at the office) or the internet as a whole. Initially, organizations set up VPNs so remote workers can work with secure files. While this still happens, the last 15 years have seen VPNs increasingly marketed to individuals, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="slk:Proton VPN;cpos:3;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="slk:ExpressVPN;cpos:4;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> and others seeing massive user growth.</p><p>Broadly, a VPN consists of two parts: the server, which forwards requests to your chosen destination, and the client, a piece of software that lets you interact with the server. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="slk:You can find a longer explanation here;cpos:5;pos:1">You can find a longer explanation here</a>, but I&#39;ll use the two sections below to tell you what you need to know right now.</p><p>One more note before that — there are multiple kinds of VPNs, including the remote-access VPNs and site-to-site VPNs commonly used by workplaces. However, for this article, I&#39;ll be talking mainly about the commercial VPN services sold to individuals for general security needs. Instead of a specific network, these VPNs are designed to handle all of a user&#39;s traffic to any point on the internet.</p><h2 id="5cc696a3-0830-4398-b2ce-ff2c298dab84"><strong>What happens when you use a VPN?</strong></h2><p>First, you use the client to connect to a server — either the fastest one available or a particular location you need. Once you&#39;ve connected, every request you send to the internet goes through the VPN server first. This communication between your device and the web is encrypted so it can&#39;t be traced back to you.</p><p>The VPN server decrypts your requests and sends them on. The destination then communicates with the VPN server, which relays the information back to you — after re-encrypting it so nobody follows it home.</p><p>Since the VPN does everything on your behalf, it&#39;s your &quot;mask&quot; online. Your internet service provider (ISP) and third parties can see what&#39;s being done, but — so long as you’re not otherwise logged in or identifying yourself — nobody knows that it&#39;s you doing it. It&#39;s like having a friend order pizza for you so the pizzeria doesn&#39;t hear you calling for the third time this week (not that I speak from experience).</p><h2 id="3fc61835-654b-42ae-b891-e1a638f125af"><strong>What&#39;s the point of using a VPN?</strong></h2><p>Why add an extra step to the already complex process of getting online? The two biggest reasons are maintaining anonymity and changing your virtual location. I&#39;ve already explained how a VPN keeps you anonymous. Among other things, this prevents your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers and protects activists who face government repercussions for what they do online.</p><p>Changing your virtual location is part of masking, but it can also be used to see the internet as it&#39;s visible in other countries. Streaming services are frequently limited to certain places, and almost all of them change the available content based on their licenses in each nation. You can also use a VPN in a country with a nationwide firewall, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-05-fan-bingxi-great-firewall-of-china.html" data-i13n="slk:like China;cpos:6;pos:1">like China</a>, to see forbidden outside information sources.</p><h2 id="6e0d3680-d238-4f09-9c70-12192098a2bf"><strong>How does a VPN work? The full technical explanation</strong></h2><p>Most online explanations stop after defining a VPN as an anonymous agent between you and the internet — but I wrote this article to go a little bit deeper. To understand what a VPN is doing on a technical level, we&#39;ll need to cover how the internet works, how the VPN knows where to send encrypted information and just what &quot;encryption&quot; actually is.</p><h3 id="02caaf09-a724-4593-b963-d8b790c505c1"><strong>How the internet transmits data</strong></h3><p>When you&#39;re not using a VPN, internet traffic goes directly from your modem to your ISP, then on to your chosen destination. The key technologies here are IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, and TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. They&#39;re usually combined as TCP/IP.</p><p>You may have heard that every online device has an IP address that identifies it to every other device. TCP/IP governs not just those names but how data moves between them. Here&#39;s how it works, step-by-step.</p><ol><li><p>You click a link or enter a URL into your web browser.</p></li><li><p>Your computer sends a request to your modem, asking to see the page associated with the URL. Your modem forwards the request to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>Your ISP finds a domain name server (DNS) that tells it which IP address is connected to the URL you asked to see. It then sends the request to that IP address along the fastest available route, which will involve being relayed between several nodes.</p></li><li><p>That IP address is connected with a server that holds the content you&#39;re looking for. Once it receives the request, it breaks the data down into small packets of about 1 to 1.5 kilobytes.</p></li><li><p>These packets separate to find their own fastest routes back to your ISP, your modem and finally your web browser, which reassembles them.</p></li><li><p>You see a web page, likely no more than a second after you asked for it.</p></li></ol><p>The outgoing requests and inbound packets are key to understanding VPN function. A VPN intervenes during step 2 (when your modem contacts your ISP) and step 5 (when your ISP sends the packets back to you). In the next section, I&#39;ll explain exactly what it does during those steps.</p><h3 id="4bfdc75a-e03c-4367-9846-9aa3f1bf8c98"><strong>How VPN tunneling protects data</strong></h3><p>You might have heard a VPN&#39;s activities described as &quot;tunneling.&quot; That term refers to a figurative tunnel being created between your device and the VPN. Data enters the tunnel when it&#39;s encrypted by the VPN client and exits when it&#39;s decrypted by the VPN server. Between those two points, encryption means nobody can see the true data. It&#39;s as though it&#39;s traveling through an opaque tunnel.</p><p>While the tunnel is a useful metaphor, it may be better to think of VPN encryption as an encapsulation. Each packet of data sent via VPN is &quot;wrapped&quot; in a second packet, which both encrypts the original packet and contains information for reaching the VPN server. However, none of these outer layers have the complete path — each just knows enough to reach the next relay. In this way, the origin point (that&#39;s you) remains invisible.</p><p>The same thing happens when the internet returns content to show you. Your ISP sends the data to the VPN server, because, as far as it knows, that&#39;s where the request came from. The VPN then encrypts each packet and sends them back to you for decryption and reassembly. It takes a little longer with the extra steps; that&#39;s why VPNs always slightly slow down your browsing speed, though the best ones don&#39;t do that by much (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="slk:Surfshark;cpos:7;pos:1">Surfshark</a> is currently the fastest).</p><p>You learned in that last section that two protocols, IP and TCP (usually combined as TCP/IP), are responsible for letting online devices talk to each other, even if they&#39;ve never connected before. In the same way, a VPN protocol is like a shared language that lets VPNs encrypt, move and decrypt information. See the next section to learn how a VPN protocol works in detail.</p><h3 id="795a93d9-5500-4c8a-b5a1-fcfde25c4ccd"><strong>How VPN protocols encrypt data</strong></h3><p>VPN protocols are the technology behind VPNs; every other feature of your VPN is just a method of interacting with them. All protocols are designed to encrypt data packets and wrap them in a second layer that includes information on where to send them. The main differences are the shape of that second layer, the types of encryption used and how the client establishes its initial secure connection with the server.</p><p>It&#39;s extremely common for VPNs to advertise protocols with &quot;bank-grade&quot; or &quot;military-grade&quot; encryption. This is talking about the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is used by financial institutions and the US government and military. AES-256 is indeed some of the strongest available encryption, but it&#39;s only part of the story. As a symmetric algorithm, it&#39;s not fully secure on its own, because the same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt it — and those keys can be stolen.</p><p>For that reason, most VPN protocols use AES-256 (or a similarly strong cipher like ChaCha20) to encrypt the data packets themselves, then combine it with a larger suite of multiple encryption algorithms. One of the most reliable and popular protocols, OpenVPN, uses the asymmetric TLS protocol to establish a secure relationship between client and server, then transmits packets encrypted with AES-256 across that channel, knowing the keys will be safe.</p><p>Explaining this could easily reach the length of a book, but the basic principle isn&#39;t complicated. In asymmetric encryption, a sender encodes data with a unique key, then a recipient decodes it with a different paired key. The keys are provided by a trusted third party. In a maneuver called a TLS handshake, the server and client send each other encrypted data. If each can decode the other&#39;s test data, they know they have a matched pair of keys, which proves that both are the same client and server that got the keys from the trusted authority.</p><p>Why not just use asymmetric encryption for the data itself, if it&#39;s more secure? Mainly, protocols don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s a lot slower. Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of resource-heavy math that makes connections drag. That&#39;s why OpenVPN and others use the asymmetric-to-symmetric two-step instead.</p><p>To summarize, a VPN protocol is a complex set of instructions and tools that control encryption and routing via VPN servers. Protocols still in use include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, SSTP and L2TP. PPTP, one of the oldest protocols, is no longer considered secure. On top of these, VPNs often build their own proprietary protocols, such as ExpressVPN&#39;s Lightway.</p><h2 id="194fe0d7-96f6-4022-bc10-fa63aa7f4be1"><strong>Putting it all together</strong></h2><p>Now that we&#39;ve hit all the relevant information, let&#39;s revisit that step-by-step from earlier, this time with a VPN in the mix. Here are the steps, starting with establishing the VPN connection and ending with anonymously viewing a website.</p><ol><li><p>You open your VPN client, choose a server location and connect. The VPN client and server authenticate each other with a TLS handshake.</p></li><li><p>The client and server exchange the symmetric keys they&#39;ll use to encrypt and decrypt packets for the duration of this session (i.e. until you disconnect). Your VPN client tells you that it&#39;s established a secure tunnel.</p></li><li><p>You open your web browser and enter a URL. Your browser sends a request to view the content at that address.</p></li><li><p>The request goes to your VPN client, which encrypts it and adds an outer layer of information with directions to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The encrypted request reaches the VPN server, which decrypts it and forwards it to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>As normal, your ISP finds the IP address associated with the URL you entered and forwards your request along.</p></li><li><p>The destination server receives the request and sends all the necessary packets of information back to your ISP, which forwards it to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The VPN server encrypts each packet and adds a header directing it to the VPN client.</p></li><li><p>The client decrypts the packets and forwards them to your web browser.</p></li><li><p>You see the web page you opened.</p></li></ol><p>Because of the encrypted tunnel, the request arrives at the VPN server without any information on where it came from. Thus, the VPN doesn&#39;t actually encrypt your activity on the websites themselves — for the most part, the HTTPS protocol does that. Instead, a VPN gives you a false name to put in the register, with no information that could be traced back to your real identity.</p><h2 id="6588ec1f-d408-4bde-bda5-ba8ecd56620e"><strong>How to use this information</strong></h2><p>Now that you know how a VPN works on a technical level, you&#39;re better equipped to choose one for yourself. You can cut through marketing hype statements like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Military-grade encryption!&quot; (It&#39;s the same algorithm everybody uses)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Stay completely anonymous online!&quot; (Plaintext you post on social media is not encrypted)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Dodge ISP throttling!&quot; (If your ISP is throttling you based on your IP address, this works — but if you&#39;re being slowed down because of your moment-to-moment activity, your identity doesn&#39;t matter)</p></li></ul><p>A VPN is just one important part of a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html" data-i13n="slk:complete cybersecurity breakfast;cpos:8;pos:1">complete cybersecurity breakfast</a>. While hiding your IP address, make sure to also use strong passwords, download updates immediately and remain alert for social engineering tactics.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year at CES, Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html">debuted</a> its first mainstream Micro RGB TV, a 115-inch model that surprised us with its rich, vivid colors and $30,000 price tag. Now, the company has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-premium-micro-rgb-lineup-for-2026-with-new-sizes-and-advanced-features">announced</a> that it will be showing off an entire lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES 2026 ranging from 55- to 115-inch models, promising to set &quot;a new standard for premium home viewing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a reminder, Micro RGB is a unique new technology similar to Mini LED displays. Unlike the white backlights used on Mini LEDs, though, it uses tiny red, green and blue LEDs that produce more accurate colors and offer smaller and more controllable dimming zones. However, because pixels can&#39;t be turned on and off individually like Micro LED or OLED, Micro RGB contrast ratios aren&#39;t as high. They promise to be brighter and more color accurate than other technologies, though, hence the high prices and &quot;premium&quot; branding.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung&#39;s upcoming Micro RGB lineup will be available in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models and use the next evolution of the company&#39;s technology. The main claim to fame is near broadcast monitor-like color accuracy, covering 100 percent of the demanding BT.2020 HDR standard. That new standard now has a name and VDE certification: Micro RGB Precision Color 100.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other key features include Samsung&#39;s &quot;Micro RGB AI Engine Pro&quot; for more precise frame-by-frame clarity and realism, new color enhancement functions, Samsung&#39;s glare free tech and enhanced audio features including Dolby Atmos and Adaptive Sound Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, LG <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">announced</a> that it would also show off new televisions using Micro RGB technology, with 75-, 86- and 100-inch models coming next year. What remains to be seen, however, is pricing. Given the $30,000 cost of the 115-inch model, you can likely expect the first Micro RGB televisions to be among the most expensive in the lineups of both LG and Samsung.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s board has formally rejected the $108 billion takeover bid from Paramount Skydance, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-board-of-directors-unanimously-recommends-shareholders-reject-paramount-tender-offer-302644592.html">announced</a>. WBD said it remains committed to its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html">$82.7 billion deal</a> with Netflix, which would close some time next year, pending regulatory approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;[The board] has unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance on December 8, 2025 is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a &quot;Superior Proposal&quot; under the terms of WBD&#39;s merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025,&quot; the studio said in the press release.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Paramount&#39;s offer was funded in part by sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, so it could have triggered a national security review by the US government. However, Paramount said that even if those entities dropped out, the company&#39;s owners (the Ellisons) would &quot;backstop the full amount of the bid.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the board said that Paramount &quot;has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a &#39;full backstop&#39; from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has,&quot; adding that &quot;the terms of the Netflix merger are superior.&quot; WBD explained that Paramount is relying on an &quot;opaque revocable trust&quot; for said backstop which is &quot;no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.&quot; WBD&#39;s board also noted that Paramount expects to achieve $9 billion in cost synergies from the merger, and that &quot;would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2025/Netflix-Welcomes-Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-Recommendation/default.aspx">statement</a>, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that &quot;the Warner Bros. Discovery board reinforced that Netflix&#39;s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders. This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders and the broader entertainment industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Paramount has yet to comment, but the company has previously said that its $30 per share offer is a better deal, due to the all-cash nature (compared to 84 percent cash for Netflix) and fact that it would have a clearer path to regulatory approval due to the Ellison&#39;s supposedly tight relationship with President Trump.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-131055882.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-gaming-subscriptions">Gaming subscriptions</h2> 
<p>Game consoles are certainly among the most popular gift ideas this time of year. If you know someone who’s been so good that they’re getting a new Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, one of these subscriptions will make their shiny toy immediately playable out of the box.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="78e039b67e7a485a9be7a300b64c74e3" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>There’s no doubt that Microsoft has changed the value proposition for its Game Pass subscription service service. It recently <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">raised the price</a> for its most comprehensive Ultimate tier by 50 percent, to $30 a month. That’s a bitter pill to swallow —&nbsp;but devoted players who have an Xbox as their main (or only) console will still get a ton of value out of Game Pass.</p> 
<p>The aforementioned Ultimate tier provides access to more than 500 games that’ll work on Xbox, PC and other supported devices. It’s also the only way to get “day one” release games like <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <em>Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer World 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em>; in recent years other high-profile day one releases have included <em>Doom: The Dark Ages, Starfield, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Forza Motorsport</em> and numerous others. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also have access to the highest quality and fastest game streaming Xbox offers. For a slightly less hardcore Xbox fan, though, the $15-per-month Premium tier is also worth considering.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="7bd823db7e494a4691dfe0cdab58f4c4" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Online-Gift-19-99/dp/B07WP82643"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Nintendo’s Switch Online subscription has gotten some nice upgrades in 2025, the year of the Switch 2. As it has for years, Nintendo offers two different Switch Online plans. The basic $20-per-year plan unlocks online play and enables Switch 2 owners to use the system&#39;s GameChat capabilities. It also includes more than 100 Game Boy, NES and Super NES games, cloud backups of your saved games as well as the occasional special offers. It also includes access to the rather silly but enjoyable Nintendo Music app, so you can listen to your favorite Zelda or Mario tracks at any time.</p> 
<p>The $50 “expansion pack” adds a collection of N64, Game Boy Advance and Sega Genesis games as well as some DLC for games like <em>Mario Kart 8, Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>and <em>Splatoon 2.</em> But most interesting are the new additions for Switch 2 owners: there’s a small but growing library of GameCube games, including classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX.</em> Switch 2 owners who have the expansion pack subscription can also upgrade to the Switch 2 versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> for free.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="0b7f0c8d836d42aea64d419d136146c3" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>A PlayStation Plus subscription is a must-have for any PS5 owners. That’s partially because you need one to play multiplayer games online, but there are plenty of other significant benefits. PS Plus comes in three tiers, but the middle “Extra” plan ($15/month or $135/year) is probably best for most gamers. In addition to cloud storage for saves, online multiplayer support and a couple of free games for your library every month, you get access to the PlayStation Plus catalog, which includes more than 400 PS4 and PS5 games.</p> 
<p>There are a number of heavy hitters here, including <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and <em>II</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima, God of War Ragnarok, Death Stranding, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered </em>and <em>Returnal</em> alongside lower-profile hits and indie games such as <em>Citizen Sleeper, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Dave the Diver </em>and<em> Humanity</em>. If you know someone who loves older games though, the “Premium” tier ($18/month or $160/year) adds a bunch of titles from the PS1 through the PS4 as well as perks like game trials and PS5 game streaming from the cloud.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Amazon’s latest Echo speakers arrived in October, a feature the company spent time hyping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/everything-announced-at-amazons-fall-hardware-event-143557140.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">during its fall devices event</a> was missing. Alexa Home Theater <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-surround-sound-for-echo-speakers-is-rolling-out-now-204557932.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">arrived in late November</a>, allowing owners of a recent Fire TV device and either of the new Echo speakers the ability to use up to five units and an Echo Sub as a surround sound setup. The main selling point is that the underlying tech allows you to put the speakers wherever you want and Alexa Home Theater will handle the rest. A robust array of speakers is a considerable investment, though, and there are limitations to Amazon’s latest play for your living room.</p><h2 id="6ba76f50-c630-458b-aad1-e48fdaab1636">What is Alexa Home Theater?</h2><p>At the most basic level, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-will-let-you-use-amazons-echo-speakers-for-surround-sound-153325469.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Alexa Home Theater</a> is an automatic room calibration tool that’s akin to Trueplay from Sonos, SpaceFit Sound from Samsung or Sound Field Optimization from Sony. The feature, no matter which company builds it, is designed to automatically tune the acoustics of a soundbar or other speakers to the acoustics of the room. These tools allow companies to account for things like high ceilings and weird angles, adjusting audio performance so things sound their best no matter how your home is designed.&nbsp;</p><p>Like similar technologies from other companies, Alexa Home Theater and the latest Echo speakers also support spatial awareness. This allows you to position the speakers however they best fit in your living room and the underlying tech will balance the sound based on their proximity to each other. Gone are the days when you have to put rear speakers in a specific spot in order for them to work.&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest Echo speakers, Amazon overhauled Alexa Home Theater to accommodate more devices in a single setup. Now you can use up to five <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-dot-max-review-disappointing-sound-but-alexa-is-a-star-190000721.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Echo Dot Max</a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">second-generation Echo Studio</a> units and a subwoofer at the same time. Of course, this means you can put the compact speakers around the perimeter of your home theater space, providing more immersive surround sound than a single speaker or two can muster. Alexa Home Theater recognizes each Echo speaker and adjusts the system accordingly.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="6748d315-b980-4569-9ffb-dcd3c13b1180">What hardware do I need to use it?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7661.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7661.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max." data-uuid="751570be-4bdd-425d-ae5e-1b1d66c443d9"><figcaption>My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you want to use more than two Echo speakers and a subwoofer in your Alexa Home Theater setup, you’ll need the latest Amazon devices to make that happen. That list includes the Echo Dot Max and second-gen Echo Studio, along with the Echo Sub if you crave more bass. You’ll also need a Fire TV streaming gadget for the multi-speaker option, but it has to be one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Fire TV Cube (3rd gen)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd gen) </p></li><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K (2nd gen)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K Plus</p></li></ul><p>You might be wondering why Alexa Home Theater isn’t supported on other (older) Amazon streaming and audio models. Well, it is… but you’ll only be allowed to pair just two Echo speakers of the same model with an optional subwoofer for a total of three devices.

This two-speaker method is also supported on more Fire TV devices, including some standalone TVs with Amazon’s streaming platform built in.&nbsp;</p><p>In that scenario, it means you could pair two Echo speakers with a subwoofer, for example, and have them play the same audio content with Alexa Home Theater.</p><p>Currently, Amazon says these are Fire TV devices that <em>don’t</em> support Alexa Home Theater:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Fire TV Stick 4K Select</p></li><li><p>Amazon Fire TV 2-Series</p></li><li><p>Fire TV 4-Series (2025 Release, newest model)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Omni QLED Series (2025 Release, newest model)</p></li><li><p>Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series (2024 Release, newest model)</p></li></ul><h2 id="62306705-8cb6-47fd-82b2-fb10ff00dd09">How to set up Alexa Home Theater</h2><p>Like nearly all home theater speakers and soundbars these days, setting up Alexa Home Theater is easy once you have the required hardware in place. Unlike a lot of the competition, this initial configuration isn’t done in a mobile app — it’s handled by the Settings menu on a compatible Fire TV device. Before you initiate the setup process, you’ll want to make sure your Echo speakers and Fire TV device are up to date. You can ask Alexa to check for updates to the speakers, while you’ll need to check the Device &amp; Software section of the Fire TV Settings menu for those gadgets. Once everything is current, here are the steps to follow to get started with Alexa Home Theater:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your Fire TV.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Display &amp; Sounds.</strong>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Alexa Home Theater</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Create Alexa Home Theater</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select the compatible Echo speakers. You can also add an Echo Sub during this step.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the system. After you select either the second-gen Echo Studio or the Echo Dot Max, hit <strong>Next</strong> and the system will calibrate automatically. If you select other Echo speakers, hit <strong>Next</strong> and then confirm the placement of the speakers before calibration.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When the setup is complete, the Alexa Home Theater system is ready to use. To do so, select either <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>Watch Preview</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h2 id="72c3e5ae-efb1-4322-9f77-da86691a989b">Using Alexa Home Theater with four Echo Studio speakers</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7655.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7655.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue." data-uuid="a4174255-df69-4ded-a0ab-3e4fa059e386"><figcaption>The two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Like most home theater gear, the Fire TV will play short audio clips through each Echo speaker and your TV speakers to determine their location and to calibrate the group to the room. From start to finish, the setup process takes about five minutes — so long as your Fire TV and all speakers are running up-to-date firmware. It’s a quick and straightforward process, which meant I was watching <em>Fallout </em>soon after putting all of the speakers in place.&nbsp;</p><p>While streaming that video game-inspired original series, the Echo Studios provided an immersive audio experience with directional sound and crisp, clear dialogue. The front two speakers handle speech, but there’s some nuance in what direction it’s coming from on screen. Rear speakers are tasked with the bulk of the environmental noise, whether that’s nearby water, passing cars, rain or gunfire — just to name a few. I was also pleasantly surprised by how much bassy rumble these speakers produced during movies and shows. I didn’t think a single unit was particularly adept at low-end tone during my review, but I think it would be just fine to use a collection of Echo Studios without having to add the Echo Sub.&nbsp;</p><p>The overall audio performance here is certainly a boost over any TV’s built-in speakers, but the sense of immersion isn’t as complete as what a soundbar and a pair of rear satellite speakers can provide. Specifically, I felt like the foursome of Echo Studio speakers in my test setup stumbled with the height channels. Despite the angled design of the devices and their multi-driver configurations, the effect of overhead and aerial sounds was quite subdued.&nbsp;</p><p>And the worst part about this is that there’s no way to try to fix it with settings. That’s because there are minimal settings to adjust once Alexa Home Theater is set up. There are two features — dialogue boost and volume leveler — but those are both Fire TV settings rather than items meant for any connected speakers. In the Alexa Home Theater menu, there’s a lip sync tool to address any audio lag, which is a standard item for any soundbar. I would’ve loved to see some kind of channel adjustment at the very least, so that I could dial in the mix a bit rather than relying on Amazon’s preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>If you turn to Alexa for help, the assistant can only change bass, treble and midrange, and it can only do so when prompted by voice commands. When I asked for it to turn up the dialogue, it seemed to just increase the volume. If I asked it to adjust the height channels, Alexa responded affirmatively, but it didn’t sound like any tweaks were applied.&nbsp;Amazon later confirmed that those basic EQ changes are Alexa and actually do here. </p><p>Another gripe I have with Alexa Home Theater is the inability to connect my phone or another device to the entire group for music. You can still sync with individual Echo Studio speakers for music via Bluetooth, but if you want to use the whole shebang, you’ll have to play your tunes from the Fire TV or ask Alexa to help.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire TV platform has plenty of audio streaming apps, but Apple Music isn’t there and that’s where my monthly subscription resides. You have to add the Apple Music skill to the Alexa app on your phone first, then you can stream content from the service by asking Amazon’s assistant. For other services with Fire TV apps, you’re using your TV to play music, and most of the time I want the TV off and to just pick up my phone to blast some Spiritbox. I also like to control the queue from my phone, but alas that’s not an option here.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="7d812f3c-8d33-4c3f-ab25-051c43c35408">Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7344.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7344.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Amazon&#39;s new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model." data-uuid="1c0f434b-4431-483f-8bfe-ace7b313c20b"><figcaption>Amazon&#39;s new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>The main issue with using four Echo Studios and a Fire TV is the cost. For the speakers alone, you’re looking at nearly $900 for the setup I tested. When the new Echo speakers were announced in September, Amazon said it would offer Alexa Home Theater bundles with multiple speakers, but I couldn’t find those on the company’s website. </p><p>For comparison, Sonos currently offers multiple configurations of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">the Beam soundbar</a> and either <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Era 100 speakers</a> or a sub for less than $800. For the same price as four Echo Studio speakers, you can get <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-adds-the-bravia-theater-bar-6-to-its-dolby-atmos-soundbar-lineup-160012544.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Sony’s Bravia Theater System 6</a>, which comes with a soundbar, rear speakers and a subwoofer. There are other options from other companies as well in the $800 range, and most people will likely be happier with a dedicated soundbar-based setup than four Echo units and a subwoofer. Hello, AirPlay and Google Cast.</p><p>From an aesthetic perspective, I can see why someone might opt for multiple Echo speakers instead of a mid-sized (or larger) soundbar. Two Echo Studios on either side of my TV with the two rear units tucked away on a shelf certainly creates a clean look. And in terms of sound, using two Echo Studio speakers, let alone four like I tested, will provide a noticeable boost over a TV’s built-in speakers. However, the lack of customization and the inability to control music from my phone for an Alexa Home Theater group makes it hard to recommend Amazon’s latest for shoppers looking for more immersive audio in the living room. Hopefully the company will continue to refine this feature so that it’s more capable in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-newest-echo-feature-130000328.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is in discussions with OpenAI to invest $10 billion in the company while supplying more of its AI chips and cloud computing services, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/4217107e-2c98-4b78-9961-67d75237fac4"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>. The deal would push OpenAI&#39;s valuation over $500 billion but is likely to raise more questions about the company&#39;s circular investment agreements involving chips and data centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two companies are also in talks about the possibility of OpenAI helping Amazon with its online marketplace, similar to deals it has made with Etsy, Shopify and Instacart. However, any agreement still wouldn&#39;t allow Amazon to market OpenAI&#39;s most advanced models on its developer cloud platform, as Microsoft holds the exclusive rights to those until the 2030s.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal">recently restructured</a> its agreement with Microsoft to allow it to use data center capacity from other suppliers. Around the same time, it made a string of deals with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal">NVIDIA</a>, Oracle, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-agrees-to-buy-tens-of-billions-worth-of-amd-chips-134816630.html">AMD</a> and others to build out data center capacity and acquire or rent AI chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new deal would require OpenAI to use Amazon&#39;s Trainium AI chips and rent more data center capacity from Amazon Web Services (AWS). That&#39;s on top of the $38 billion that OpenAI has already committed to renting servers from AWS over the next seven years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These deals have sounded alarms among investors considering their circular nature. In many of those, including this latest Amazon deal, OpenAI is taking investment money and then sending that cash back to the same company for infrastructure or chips. And the amounts are staggering, with just two companies, Softbank and Oracle, spending a combined $400 billion on new data centers for OpenAI&#39;s compute needs. And so far, OpenAI has lost more money than it makes.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-10-billion-in-openai-and-supply-its-trainium-chips-103653151.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-chromebooks-faqs">Best Chromebooks FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-chrome-os-and-why-would-i-use-it-over-windows">What is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?</h3> 
<p>This is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome&#39;s operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Of course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.</p> 
<p>Google and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.</p> 
<p>Chromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-do-chromebooks-do-well">What do Chromebooks do well?</h3>

<p>Put simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data.</p> 
<p>Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.</p> 
<p>If you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/">Google’s AI Pro plan</a> — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.</p> 
<p>As for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.</p> 
<p>Finally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.</p>

<p>Chrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day.</p> 
<p>Chromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.</p> 
<p>Of course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.</p> 
<p>Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-should-i-spend-on-a-chromebook">How much should I spend on a Chromebook?</h3> 
<p>Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.</p> 
<p>There are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.</p>

It’s a few years older than our current top pick, so its processor isn’t fresh and it only has 128GB of storage. It also won’t get updates from Google as long as newer models. But it still combines a nice screen and keyboard with solid performance. This laptop typically costs $500, which feels high given its a few years old and Acer’s Chromebook Plus 514 is only $350, but if you can find it on sale and can’t find the Acer it’s worth a look.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-cx15">ASUS CX15</h3> 
<p>This Chromebook is extremely affordable – you can currently pick it up for only <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:;cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;itemId=walmart_transaction_13737005799&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=71ca355e-be06-3ba2-a84a-3e55a19dbc84&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=%24159+at+Walmart&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAQB3NkdZEVCnhLjBbhsCVT4MZzPd39_iYa-Oa2OPmnW3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-Chromebook-CX1-15-6-FHD-Intel-Celeron-N4500-128GB-eMMC-4GB-RAM-ChromeOS-Fabric-Blue%2F13737005799" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Chromebook-CX1-15-6-FHD-Intel-Celeron-N4500-128GB-eMMC-4GB-RAM-ChromeOS-Fabric-Blue/13737005799">$159 at Walmart</a>. That price and its large 15.6-inch screen is mainly what it has going for it, as the Intel Celeron N4500 chip and 4GB of RAM powering it does not provide good performance if you’re doing anything more than browsing with a few tabs open. If you’re shopping for someone with extremely basic needs and have a small budget, the CX15 might fit the bill. But just be aware that you get what you pay for.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</h3> 
<p>Samsung’s <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-quirky-in-ways-both-good-and-bad-140036965.html">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss]]></description>

Back in 2022, the California DMV <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/california-dmv-accuses-tesla-false-advertising-130350292.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">accused the automaker</a> of using deceptive language to advertise those products and making  it seem like its vehicles are capable of level 5 autonomous driving. Tesla has since added the word “Supervised” to the name of its Full Self-Driving assistance technology.  </p><p>As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/tesla-s-sales-in-california-set-to-be-suspended-dmv-says?srnd=homepage-americas" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, the DMV asked the administrative law judge if a suspension is warranted based on the evidence it presented. Even though the judge has agreed that it is, the agency will give Tesla 90 days to explain its side and remove any untrue or misleading language in the marketing materials for the products. Tesla’s sales and manufacturing in California will only be suspended if it doesn’t comply within that timeframe.</p><p>“We’re really asking Tesla to do their job, as they’ve done in other markets, to properly brand these vehicles,” said California DMV director, Steve Gordon, in a statement.</p><p>A suspension in California could be devastating for the automaker. While new Tesla registrations in the state plummeted earlier this year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-first-quarter-registrations-california-fell-15-industry-data-shows-2025-04-16/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Reuters</a> says California accounts for nearly a third of the company’s sales in the country. In addition, Tesla only manufactures its Model S and X vehicles in its Fremont plant, where it also produces Model 3 and Model Y units. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-used-deceptive-language-to-market-autopilot-california-judge-rules-035826786.html?src=rss]]></description>

Even after the platform rebranded, though, at least one remnant of the original Twitter brand has stuck around: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Twitter.com" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Twitter.com</a></a> still redirects to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://X.com" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">X.com</a></a>.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>The updated <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/en/tos" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">terms of service</a> <em>TechCrunch</em> spotted now say that as of January 16, 2025, &quot;nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.&quot; The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gerbenlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DDE-1-25-cv-01510-1.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">counterpetition</a> also reiterates that the Twitter trademarks are X&#39;s &quot;exclusive property.&quot;</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Coates said that Operation Bluebird’s cancellation petition was “based on well-established trademark law” and that he believes the upstart will prevail. “X legally abandoned the TWITTER mark, publicly declared the Twitter brand ‘dead,’ and spent substantial resources establishing a new brand identity.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its last <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/16/xbox-december-2025-update-mobile-app-updates-audio-support/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Xbox-focused software update</a> of the year, Microsoft is improving the Bluetooth performance of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-xbox-wireless-headset-receives-microphone-and-battery-life-upgrades-151455182.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xbox Wireless Headset</a> to make it work even better with Windows 11. Microsoft released the latest Wireless Headset as an accessory for Xbox Series X/S and PC, but as of this update, Xbox Wireless Headset owners on Windows will now have a leg up on their console counterparts thanks to support for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio.</p><p>Microsoft says that supporting Bluetooth LE Audio will let the headset offer lower latency audio, better battery life, richer stereo sound and the ability to share audio across multiple compatible Bluetooth accessories at the same time. Not revolutionary updates, but still nice to have if you bought a $110 Xbox Wireless Headset back in 2024. Provided you&#39;re running the latest version of Windows 11 and your device supports Bluetooth LE, Microsoft says you can take advantage of the improvements by updating your headset in the Xbox Accessories app.</p><p>If you&#39;re a regular user of the Xbox mobile app, Microsoft is also making some changes there. After adding the ability <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/xbox-april-update-buy-games-xbx-app-stream-your-own-game-console/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to purchase Xbox games directly from the app</a> in April — a feature made possible after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-has-to-open-up-the-play-store-in-epic-games-antitrust-ruling-195239228.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Google</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-allow-external-payment-options-123039994.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Apple</a> were forced to change the rules of their app stores — Microsoft is now adding a dedicated Store tab to the app. You&#39;ll also be able to add games to your wishlist and search for add-ons and DLC directly in the app.</p><p>Microsoft ending the year with Windows and mobile app updates reflects the ways the company&#39;s gaming strategy has changed in 2025. After spending decades positioning itself as a console maker, Microsoft is seemingly making Xbox software its main focus going forward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-last-xbox-update-of-2025-includes-a-handy-wireless-headset-upgrade-204500386.html?src=rss]]></description>

</div><p>YouTube was testing the addition of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-testing-bitesize-games-on-desktop-and-mobile-163742756.html?guccounter=1" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">small-scale games</a> to its desktop and mobile platforms back in 2023, then added <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/youtube-introduces-multiplayer-mini-games-on-playables-133056235.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">multiplayer capability</a> to Playables last year. Since AI is appearing all over Google-owned services, today&#39;s news probably shouldn&#39;t be a surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The premise sounds similar to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-disco-is-an-experimental-web-browser-that-builds-ai-widgets-based-on-your-tabs-180000701.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Disco and GenTabs</a> projects that Google Labs recently announced. They offer an AI layer to web browsing: provide a natural language input, get an interactive widget that does what you asked for. Despite my skeptical attitude toward AI, I can see those tools having some practical applications for search, where the goal is to aggregate whatever data you&#39;re looking for into a manageable, easy-to-read interface.&nbsp;</p><p>But a game is not simple. A good game takes what might be a simple idea and, with finesse and iteration and skill, transforms it into a genuinely fun experience. It&#39;s a cute parlor trick that AI assistants can help people to make stuff without technical knowledge, but there&#39;s a reason professional game devs work hard to amass all their know-how. Playables Builder is a peak example of misunderstanding what artificial intelligence is best at. Just because a chatbot can make a game doesn&#39;t mean anyone will enjoy playing it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-is-letting-creators-make-playable-games-with-a-gemini-3-tool-195500318.html?src=rss]]></description>

Holiday discounts running through December 29 bring the anime streaming service&#39;s year-long Fan subscription from $80 down to $67 and its Mega Fan subscription from $120 down to $100. That&#39;s either $13 or $20 off access to one of the largest libraries of anime series and movies out there.</p> 
<p>While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll&#39;s library, new episodes &quot;shortly after they air in Japan&quot; and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Notably missing from either subscription is access to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/a-new-crunchyroll-manga-mobile-app-arrives-later-this-year-155234860.html"><ins>Crunchyroll&#39;s new Manga service</ins></a>, but unless you&#39;re specifically looking for reading material, you&#39;ll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll&#39;s video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You&#39;ll find long-running series like <em>One Piece</em> and newer hits like <em>Spy X Family</em>, alongside hundreds of more niche series.</p> 
<p>Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-220920170.html"><ins>acquired by Sony</ins></a>, it&#39;s been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/crunchyroll-blames-third-party-vendor-for-ai-subtitle-mess-145621606.html"><ins>produced poor results</ins></a>. It&#39;s hard to beat Crunchyroll&#39;s library, though, and for as little as $65, you&#39;ll get more than your money&#39;s worth.</p>

The partnership covers new episodes from more than 15 popular podcasts, including <em>The Breakfast Club</em>, <em>Dear Chelsea</em>,<em> My Favorite Murder</em> and others. Customers will have access to video podcast episodes in early 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to new footage, the partnership includes a select library of archival episodes from each show. It&#39;s worth noting that YouTube already platforms video versions of many popular podcasts, including stuff like <em>The Breakfast Club</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This follows a similar deal from earlier this year in which Netflix announced plans to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/some-spotify-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-180000074.html">stream video podcast episodes from Spotify</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in September during Meta Connect, the company previewed a new ability for its smart glasses lineup called Conversation Focus. The feature, which is able to amplify the voices of people around you, is now starting <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ai-glasses-v21-software-update-conversation-focus-soundtrack-your-world-spotify/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">to roll out</a> in the company&#39;s latest batch of software updates.</p><p>When enabled, the feature is meant to make it easier to hear the people you&#39;re speaking with in a crowded or otherwise noisy environment. &quot;You’ll hear the amplified voice sound slightly brighter, which will help you distinguish the conversation from ambient background noise,” Meta <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ai-glasses-v21-software-update-conversation-focus-soundtrack-your-world-spotify/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">explains</a>. It can be enabled either via voice commands (&quot;hey Meta, start Conversation Focus&quot;) or by adding it as a dedicated &quot;tap-and-hold&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-smart-glasses-have-a-new-shortcut-to-call-and-text-without-saying-hey-meta-213303178.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">shortcut</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta is also adding a new multimodal AI feature for Spotify. With the update, users can ask their glasses to play music on Spotify that corresponds with what they&#39;re looking at by saying “hey Meta, play a song to match this view.” Spotify will then start a playlist &quot;based on your unique taste, customized for that specific moment.&quot; For example, looking at holiday decor might trigger a similarly-themed playlist, though it&#39;s not clear how Meta and Spotify may translate more abstract concepts into themed playlists.&nbsp;</p><p>Both updates are starting to roll out now to Meta Ray-Ban glasses (both Gen 1 and Gen 2 models), as well as the Oakley Meta HSTN frames. The update will arrive first to those enrolled in Meta&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/early-access-program/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1">early access</a> program, and will be available &quot;gradually&quot; to everyone else.</p><p>Meta&#39;s newest mode of smart glasses, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> shades, are also getting some new features in the latest software update. Meta is adding the option to trigger specific commands with a single word, rather than having to say &quot;hey Meta.&quot; For example, saying &quot;photo&quot; will be enough to snap a picture and saying &quot;video&quot; will start a new recording. The company says the optional feature is meant to help athletes &quot;save some breath&quot; while on a run or bike ride.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-rolling-out-conversation-focus-and-ai-powered-spotify-features-to-its-smart-glasses-192133928.html?src=rss]]></description>

In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's "General RGB LED Backlight Technology" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has already trademarked the name <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1764577431" data-i13n="slk:&quot;True RGB,&quot;;cpos:20;pos:1">"True RGB,"</a> which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES.

The company says the updated ChatGPT Images is four times faster than its predecessor. If you&#39;re a frequent ChatGPT user, you&#39;ll know it can sometimes take a while for OpenAI&#39;s servers to create images, particularly during peak times and if you&#39;re not paying for ChatGPT Plus. In that respect, any improvement in speed is welcome. </p><p>The new version is also better at following instructions, including when you want to edit something the new model just generated. You can ask the system to add, subtract, combine, blend and even transpose elements.&nbsp;At the same time, OpenAI says the update offers better text rendering. That&#39;s something many image models have traditionally struggled with, but according to the company, the new ChatGPT Images is capable of handling denser and smaller text. As part of the today&#39;s model update, OpenAI is additionally adding a dedicated Images section to the ChatGPT sidebar. Here you&#39;ll find preset filters and prompts you can look to for inspiration.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sam-chatgpt-images.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/sam-chatgpt-images.gif" style="height:1024px;width:1024px;" alt="A portrait of Sam Altman, in the style of Johannes Vermeer&#39;s Girl with a Pearl Earring.

<p>This is basically a smartphone version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-11-rainbow-six-siege-35-million-players.html"><ins>popular tactical shooter</ins></a> <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. It was &quot;developed exclusively&quot; for mobile devices and features a trio of 5v5 multiplayer modes.

<p><em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em> offers access to a bunch of maps, including some that will be familiar to fans of the franchise. There are more than 20 operators to choose from and Ubisoft promises it&#39;ll be adding more content with each new season.</p>
<p>The company is rolling the game out early in some parts of the world. It&#39;s already playable in Poland, France, Canada and parts of Latin America. Everyone else has to wait until February.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rainbow-six-mobile-will-finally-be-available-in-february-after-years-of-testing-174001081.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The company which popularized robot vacuum cleaners around the world has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. iRobot, makers of the Roomba, has been synonymous with the category since its inception, but its star had dulled in recent years. The company plans to sell its assets to its primary supplier, China’s Picea Robotics, in the hope of maintaining its business.</p><p>Everyone’s got a strident opinion as to why iRobot fell from grace. The rugged individualists blame <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://reason.com/2025/10/31/irobot-faces-bankruptcy-after-elizabeth-warren-helped-kill-1-65-billion-amazon-merger/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">limp</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/how-irobot-lost-its-way-home/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">regulators</a> on both sides of the pond (and their hatred for big tech) for blocking Amazon’s attempted purchase in 2023. Those on the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4c0d6e71-97f9-4187-b49a-7214de83fef8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=hardware&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS93aXJlY3V0dGVyL3Jldmlld3Mvcm9vbWJhLW9iaXQvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YzBkNmU3MS05N2Y5LTQxODctYjQ5YS03MjE0ZGU4M2ZlZjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL3dpcmVjdXR0ZXIvcmV2aWV3cy9yb29tYmEtb2JpdC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaVLxSjYq1FGdE6UMBmaYUxKIYoMLwG49RQG-NrMmPi1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fwirecutter%2Freviews%2Froomba-obit%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/roomba-obit/">hardware</a> side of the fence say iRobot’s refusal to embrace LiDAR for navigation until <em>this year</em> left it behind rivals.</p><p>Then there’s the geopolitical experts, who can point at China’s industrial <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://research.hktdc.com/en/article/MjExNzc3NTk1Ng" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">policy</a>, subsidies and favorable regulatory environment compared to the US approach. After all, iRobot’s US gear is made in Vietnam, which is now subject to a 46 percent import levy. As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lr75lp239o" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>BBC News</em></a> reported, that added around $23 million to iRobot’s costs and increased the price of its hardware.</p><p>The real answer is that iRobot’s demise was caused by a perfect storm of all these factors piling on to the company. More importantly, iRobot’s situation isn’t any way unique, and should serve as a warning to every major American technology brand. It’s also a lesson in why companies need to deal with existential threats when they have the time and cash to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, once iRobot perfected the concept for the Roomba, it wasn’t long before the first copies burst onto the scene. iRobot had the brand and the know-how, but that only goes so far against well-motivated copycats. Think about the first Samsung Android handsets, and how quickly they went from iPhone imitations to class-defining devices of their own — and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-08-25-breaking-down-apples-1-billion-courtroom-victory-over-samsung.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">how hard Apple fought in court</a> to prevent it.</p><p>Even before this year’s tariffs, iRobot struggled to compete on price in a manner we’ve seen in other fields. Remember Fitbit before Google purchased it, happily selling $80 fitness trackers for years until Xiaomi swiped the low-end part of its business for itself. Even if the early MiBands weren’t very good, you could buy three for the price of a single Fitbit Charge. Yes, the argument around quality and reliability is important, but it’s often not as loud or compelling as a competing product sold for a fraction of the price.</p><p>iRobot should have either made more of an effort to offer a dirt-cheap model to undercut its rivals, or more likely pull out of the low end altogether. Earlier today, I checked out local retail listings for Roombas and its nearest competitors. Next to one another were the Roomba 405 Combo with Dock and the Roborock Q7 L5+ — both capable of vacuuming and mopping your floor. The former is currently on sale for $400 direct from iRobot, while the latter is currently selling for $220. I’m sure plenty of buyers would have seen the price difference and opted for the cheaper model.</p><p>I’m not going to throw too many Told You So’s over iRobot’s fence for not embracing LiDAR sooner. Its omission was a mistake, but you could see why it was shy about abandoning its existing setup. But the company had forgotten one key mantra about the tech world, Andy Grove’s maxim that “only the paranoid survive.” Even the fanciest, highest-end Roombas of the last five years felt a generation behind rival products.</p><p>And, at the risk of sounding like a marketing guru, it was never clear what iRobot, or Roomba, stood for. When companies flooded the market with cheaper models, iRobot needed to make it clear what it <em>meant</em> when you bought a Roomba over a generic model. What did, and could, it offer beyond the name and history that made it stand out against cheaper competitors? Companies like Apple and Dyson command a premium, but you almost always know what you’re getting for your money.</p><p>All I can say is that it’s good that there isn’t another American company presently in a similar position. I <em>certainly</em> can’t think of a controversial US company that builds things with wheels that has historically rejected <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-says-it-has-been-testing-driverless-model-ys-in-austin-for-several-days-123037251.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">LiDAR</a> for its autonomous services. One that has a brand that doesn’t stand for much, or has its identity tied too closely to the identity of its CEO. One that is staring down the barrel at a raft of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/byd-unveils-new-tech-for-twice-as-fast-ev-charging-175729412.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">better</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/chinese-ev-maker-byd-promises-to-make-all-of-its-models-self-driving-capable-164641323.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">equipped</a> and often cheaper Chinese alternatives. Because that company could surely be looking at a similar fate a decade or so down the road.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever just wished you could watch Instagram Reels right on a TV? Maybe? Well, if so, you&#39;re in luck. Meta has launched an Instagram app exclusively on Fire TV. It will be solely for &quot;short-form video content,&quot; so Reels. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-fire-tv-app-202229014.html">TikTok launched an app</a> on Fire TV in 2020 before <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-tv-app-google-tv-samsung-lg-smart-tv-065700895.html">rolling it out</a> to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-unveils-a-new-fire-tv-lineup-including-the-40-fire-tv-stick-4k-select-144541988.html">Fire TV</a> users can download the former through Amazon&#39;s App Store. It can either link to an existing account or have a separate account just for TV. The app can hold up to five different Instagram accounts — and time spent factors into any limits on teen accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Our mission is to get you to the world’s best content fast, and we’re thrilled to welcome Instagram to Fire TV,&quot; Fire TV vice president, Aidan Marcuss, said in a statement. &quot;We’re committed to keep pushing the boundaries of entertainment on customers&#39; biggest screens — the Instagram team has built an awesome experience, and we’re excited to be the first place to offer it. We can’t wait to see what customers think.&quot;</p>
<p>For now, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-adds-a-watch-history-for-reels-175555668.html">Reels</a> are separated into different channels, such as sports highlights or hidden travel gems. Reels also play automatically, so you don&#39;t have to swipe between content on the screen. According to Meta, the app is still being tested, so these formats might change in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram users in the US can now get the TV app on Amazon&#39;s Fire TV Stick HD, 4K Plus and 4K Max (first and second generation). It&#39;s also available on the Fire RV 2-Series, 4-Series, and Omni QLED Series. However, Meta says that the Instagram App for TV should be available on more devices and in other countries after this initial testing round.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-launches-a-fire-tv-app-for-reels-160003710.html?src=rss]]></description>

That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments.</p><p>Amazon reportedly told employees at the European HQ in a memo the layoffs are &quot;adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies.&quot; The company claims to be going &quot;well beyond industry benchmarks&quot; in Luxembourg with regards to the severance packages it&#39;s offering.</p><p>An Amazon employee said it would be difficult for hundreds of people who are all going into the job market at the same time to find employment elsewhere in the country. Affected employees who moved from other countries to work for Amazon will have to leave if they don&#39;t land another job in Luxembourg within three months. After the layoffs, Amazon is still expected to be the fifth-largest employer in Luxembourg, which has a population of 680,000.&nbsp;</p><p>One employee told <em>Bloomberg </em>that the cuts would primarily affect software developers amid a push in the tech industry for AI to take on more coding tasks.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Subscription boxes are the rare gift that keeps its charm long after the wrapping paper is gone. You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects. Some appeal to hardcore hobbyists, others to the curious or the comfort seekers, but all offer that same spark of delight that comes from unboxing something unexpected. These are the subscription boxes that make the best gifts to last all year.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-wallets-paypal-integration-is-ending-this-june-133045777.html">PayPal</a> is the latest company looking to become a bank in the US. On Monday, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-12-15-PayPal-Submits-Applications-to-Establish-an-Industrial-Bank-to-Expand-Access-to-Financial-Services-for-U-S-Small-Businesses">company announced</a> it had submitted applications for PayPal Bank to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI). PayPal is already a bank in Europe, based in Luxembourg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to PayPal, it has provided &quot;over $30 billion in loans and working capital&quot; for more than 420,000 business accounts globally. PayPal puts its focus on small businesses in pitching the need for a US bank. &quot;Securing capital remains a significant hurdle for small businesses striving to grow and scale,&quot; Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a release. &quot;Establishing PayPal Bank will strengthen our business and improve our efficiency, enabling us to better support small business growth and economic opportunities across the US.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>PayPal also plans to provide &quot;interest-bearing saving accounts&quot; as a bank. If approved, it would be chartered in Utah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications to become a bank have popped up left and right this year, with approval odds increasing under the Trump administration. On Friday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-125.html">announced</a> that five cryptocurrency companies, including BitGo, Circle and Ripple, received conditional approval to become federally charted trust banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,&quot; the OCC&#39;s comptroller Jonathan V.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No matter what you think of James Cameron&#39;s <em>Avatar</em> movies,&nbsp;their technical ambitions are undeniable. Cameron <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Camera_System" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">developed his own camera system</a> to shoot the first <em>Avatar</em> in 3D, but since most of the actors were digitally captured, he also had the freedom to construct scenes with a virtual camera after they were physically shot. For <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-hfr-high-frame-rate-170058030.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></a>, which arrived a whopping 13 years after the first film, Cameron also leaned into high frame rate footage and new ways of modeling natural fluid dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the third entry, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, is coming just a few years after the last sequel, I still expected Cameron to deliver some sort of new feat to wow audiences. He could have found a smoother way to employ high frame rate footage, so the film wasn&#39;t jarringly shifting between traditional 24 fps scenes and smoother 48 fps action shots. Maybe we&#39;d see more natural interactions between live actors and virtual characters and environments (it sure is hard to beat <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsIDoazDoaI" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Edie Falco suited up in a wicked exoskeleton</a> in the last film, though). </p><p>Instead, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> is just another <em>Avatar</em> film — it doesn&#39;t push any boundaries, narratively or technically. And without any technical achievements to lean on, the narrative issues inherent with <em>Avatar</em> become all the more glaring.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nb_fFj_0rq8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It&#39;s still basically a story that places a clueless white dude in the middle of a fight between indigenous and colonialist powers. (Improbably, he&#39;s crowned one of the Na&#39;vi&#39;s best warriors!). The script from Cameron and his co-writers (Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, continuing their work from <em>The Way of Water</em>) often hits identical beats to a low-rent CW show. And perhaps worst of all, the stakes of the story haven&#39;t really changed much. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his family are still fighting off the militarized Resource Development Association (RDA), Col. Quaritch still holds a grudge from being killed (twice now!) and from the Sullies raising his Tarzan-like son, Spider (Jack Champion).</p><p>There’s an attempt to cast the Na’vi in a new light with the villainous Ash People, who spend their days attacking and stealing from other tribes. While most Na’vi people work cooperatively with other clans and share their reverence for Eywa, the collective consciousness of Pandora, the Ash People resent it for not saving their villages from natural disasters. Despite a deliciously evil performance by Oona Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin&#39;s grandaughter!) as Varang, the Ash People don&#39;t amount to much more than &quot;evil Na&#39;vi.&quot; When they inevitably work together with humans to attack other Na’vi, it doesn’t feel surprising in the least. Honestly, it’s a tad insulting.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/3248B_0010_v0800.le.1131.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/3248B_0010_v0800.le.1131.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:2048px;" alt="Avatar: Fire and Ash" data-uuid="a0f1e3a9-ac0f-42b4-a86d-28f6da71ca17"><figcaption>Avatar: Fire and Ash</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th. Century Studios</div></figure><p>Perhaps we&#39;ve been spoiled by Cameron&#39;s last few films, but <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash </em>ultimately feels like more of the same. Even its massive final battle feels like a retread, since it’s set in the same ocean environment as <em>The Way of Water</em> and is once again focused on protecting psychic alien whales from humans. Cameron does let his action chops shine throughout the film, but after a certain point, trying to enjoy those sequences is like trying to eat a family-sized carton of ice cream by yourself. You’ll enjoy it for a little while, but eventually you’re&nbsp; left with a massive headache and sugar hangover.</p><p>It’s clear that James Cameron has built the Avatar franchise to explore everything he loves: Stories about protecting the environment, fighting against capitalist excess and kicking tons of ass. Parts of<em> Avatar 4</em> have already been shot, and that film is expected to arrive in 2029. But I’m hoping the 71-year-old filmmaker eventually finds his way out of Pandora. He’s co-directing the Billie Eilish concert film, <em>Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour</em>, so that’s a start. But I’m eager to see what other new worlds he can dream up. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-maybe-its-time-to-sunset-pandora-140000997.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This one&#39;s been a long time coming. Mercedes-Benz has been researching, refining and even reshaping the car that would ultimately be the CLA for years now, teasing us with technical briefings and even showing off a sultry crimson concept car a full two years ago.</p><p>That was the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mercedes-benz-concept-cla-class-mixes-big-range-and-big-style-130222801.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Concept CLA</a>, and while the production CLA you see here doesn&#39;t look quite that good, it is a fine-looking little electric sedan. More importantly, it goes as far as you&#39;d think its slippery, 0.21-coefficient-of-drag body would carry it: up to 374 miles on a charge.</p><p>With a $47,250 starting price, is this electric CLA the complete package? After spending a day behind the wheel of one, I think it might just be.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a05223a6-5a8b-4561-ac84-7ae81b011361">Higher density</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_012.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_012.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ" data-uuid="af5f7d60-607d-4294-a2f0-145955c646e1"><figcaption>2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>The CLA has long been Mercedes-Benz&#39;s most attainable sedan, a machine for those wanting something fun and stylish that offers a taste of the M-B lifestyle without breaking the bank.Attainability is still a big focus of this newly rebooted CLA, which serves as the debut venue for the company&#39;s latest generation of electrification. While most luxury auto makers would have you swing for their top-tier models to get the newest tech, Mercedes is actually bringing it to the lower end first.&nbsp;</p><p>The new CLA is built around a new battery pack that offers 20 percent more energy density than the company&#39;s previous EVs. There&#39;s a big boost in efficiency, too. Where the EQS, the company&#39;s current range meister, does up to 390 miles on a charge from roughly 110 kilowatt-hours, the CLA manages 374 miles from just 85. It&#39;s a much smaller car, sure, and lighter too at about 4,500 pounds versus 5,500 and up for the EQS, but there are bigger efficiencies at play here thanks to advanced motors and the aforementioned aerodynamics.</p><p>The CLA’s&nbsp; 0.21 coefficient of drag slots it right in between the 0.20 rating for the EQS sedan and 0.22 for the EQE. Crucially, though, despite being just as slippery as those cars, Mercedes-Benz&#39;s designers also managed to make the CLS stylish, a big step up from the efficient but amorphous profiles of its previous EVs.&nbsp;</p><p>That aerodynamic efficiency is a big part of what delivers the 374-mile range for the single-motor CLA 250+ with EQ Technology model, the formal and long-winded designation for what I drove. It delivers 268 horsepower through the rear wheels. Those wanting a bit more oomph can step up to the 349-hp, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive 350 4MATIC model. That extra power and low-grip surety costs an extra $2,550, but the bigger penalty is range: the dual-motor model maxes out at 312 miles on a charge. (There is a hybrid version of the new CLA coming as well, but we&#39;ll cover that on its own later.)</p><p>When it comes to charging, the new CLA impresses there, too. Charging at up to 320 kilowatts via the company&#39;s first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-has-won-the-ev-charging-wars-155726724.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">NACS plug</a>, the CLA adds a whopping 200 miles of range in 10 minutes. Weirdly, the car also has a separate, older-style J1772 plug for slower, level-two charging.</p><h2 id="0171fd46-aa93-4770-8594-08b2d7ec0e0c">Accessible, not basic</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_064.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_064.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The interior displays of the 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ" data-uuid="7f7fde92-e0ab-4c75-907d-53c236ae53e8"><figcaption>The interior displays of the 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>As a more attainable machine, you wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect the CLA to be completely loaded with features. Still, tick enough boxes and you can definitely get it there. While it doesn&#39;t have the luscious, curving <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Hyperscreen</a> display as the EQS, it does offer a similar experience called Superscreen. You can get up to three displays spread across the dashboard: a 10.25-inch gauge cluster on the left, a 14-inch touchscreen in the center and an optional third display (also 14 inches) on the right for the passenger to play <em>Angry Birds</em> or stream videos. If, for some reason, they wouldn&#39;t rather just look at their phone.</p><p>All those displays run the latest version of the MBUX user interface, similar to what we&#39;ve seen in the company&#39;s other EVs, but it’s a bit simpler and easier to use here. That&#39;s backed by a wholly new system-level operating system called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://mb.os" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">MB.OS</a> running on NVIDIA silicon, also making its debut on the CLA. Mercedes says this not only has far more capability but can also be more comprehensively updated via the car&#39;s 5G connection.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the features in the latest Mercedes software is baked-in AI. Say &quot;Hey, Mercedes,&quot; and you can not only change just about any setting in the car, but also engage in any number of inane conversations. I asked for a weather update for my next trip to Chicago, the latest releases from a few of my forgotten bands and even got an explanation of why the lyrics in the song &quot;Water&#39;s Edge&quot; by Seven Mary Three are so very creepy. (Don&#39;t go down there, friends.)</p><p>It&#39;s all reasonably snappy and quite useful, but not perfect. When I said &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; I got a quick listing of restaurants and offers for quick routing. When I said, &quot;I need a hospital,&quot; the system, flummoxed, just stopped talking to me. Thankfully, I did not need a hospital. I was actually feeling pretty okay.&nbsp;</p><p>That extensive software upgradability is also opening the door to a new era of car upgrades. Yes, the automotive DLC era is here, and you can pay extra to unlock additional active features like automated parking, navigation, a dashcam function and whatever else Mercedes-Benz&#39;s product planners can dream up in the future. Hopefully, there&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-04-03-download-oblivions-horse-armor-for-a-price.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">no horse armor involved</a>.</p><p>We&#39;ll see how that shakes out, but my only real complaint about the interior was that it felt a bit cramped. It&#39;s a sedan on the small side, sure, but the layout feels a bit claustrophobic. That dashboard with all the displays is situated nearly vertically, as are the sides of the center console. Sitting in the passenger seat felt like being tucked in a box.</p><p>Mind you, it was a very comfortable box, well-upholstered and featuring a lovely interior trim made of recycled paper, grooved to give the effect of a Zen garden. Headroom up front is generous and actually isn&#39;t too bad in the rear, but ducking under that sweeping roofline to get into the back seats requires a bit of flexibility.</p><h2 id="13bd0547-dcf5-42e3-83f0-207c950c103b">Drive time</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_022.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_022.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ" data-uuid="a8e477fd-c61f-4869-b1a7-40e55a316200"><figcaption>2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite being the slowest electric CLA, this little sedan gets off the line quickly. A 6.6-second 0-to-60 time under-sells the feeling of instant acceleration and throttle response that make EVs so very compelling. You only start to feel the CLA&#39;s relative lack of horsepower at higher speeds, but even there, it&#39;s hardly lacking.</p><p>That made it a blast to scoot from light to light as I was escaping from San Francisco, but it was much more fun in the foothills of Mt. Tamalpais. The CLA&#39;s steering is light yet has good feedback. I could really feel the road beneath the front tires, making for a more engaging machine than I was expecting.</p><p>That battery pack in the floor keeps body roll in check, but a positively pliant suspension makes for a relaxed affair. The CLA did a great job of soaking up the countless imperfections in and around San Francisco, making for an extremely comfortable commuter, if one that felt a bit floaty at times.</p><p>It&#39;ll be a safe commuter, too. The car is festooned with sensors, including 10 cameras of various resolutions and focal lengths, five radar sensors firing in every direction and 12 ultrasonic sensors. You&#39;ll need to pay extra for the digital keys to unlock their full functionality, though, like advanced lane-keeping and automated lane changes. There&#39;s even an advanced, point-to-point driver assistance system coming called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://MB.DRIVE" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">MB.DRIVE</a> Assist Pro that&#39;ll let the car handle most of the steering — even on secondary roads. More details on that to come.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, the car did great at managing itself on the highway, changing lanes with enough initiative to get through commuter traffic without issue, and not only bringing itself to a complete stop in traffic, but resuming again as soon as the cars ahead moved.</p><p>It even delivered good efficiency. I saw 3.9 miles per kWh, which would equate to a theoretical 331 miles from the 85 kWh battery pack. That&#39;s despite my driving with a good amount of enthusiasm and a heavy right foot. <em>Edmunds</em>, driving more conservatively, got <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6a686c6e-b7e2-4710-a51c-d3aa72b17ad0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=23ce3709-a8ec-4bef-b82f-2be57c151008&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Edmunds&amp;linkText=434+miles+from+a+single+charge&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZG11bmRzLmNvbS9jYXItbmV3cy8yMDI2LW1lcmNlZGVzLWJlbnotY2xhLWV2LXJhbmdlLWNoYXJnaW5nLXRlc3QtZmVhdHVyZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyM2NlMzcwOS1hOGVjLTRiZWYtYjgyZi0yYmU1N2MxNTEwMDgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkbXVuZHMuY29tL2Nhci1uZXdzLzIwMjYtbWVyY2VkZXMtYmVuei1jbGEtZXYtcmFuZ2UtY2hhcmdpbmctdGVzdC1mZWF0dXJlLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWIh1g8na2dv-Mzn53QZW6p947qQKFtSu4br1sDI03Rr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2F2026-mercedes-benz-cla-ev-range-charging-test-feature.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Edmunds;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2026-mercedes-benz-cla-ev-range-charging-test-feature.html">434 miles from a single charge</a>,</p><h2 id="7333da33-b44c-4ec0-8b79-92a58530b980">Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_047.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_047.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ" data-uuid="473a505d-70b4-4e29-8eeb-172cbdeaa1f6"><figcaption>2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>So the CLA looks great, drives well, has plenty of range and again, starting at $47,250, feels well-priced. Yes, you&#39;ll need to pay extra if you want to get all the toys, like the epic Dolby Atmos-capable Burmester sound system or the lovely Natural Fiber Zen interior trim. But when I ticked all the boxes I wanted, I still came out under $60,000. That put me about $5,000 below the base price of the company&#39;s next-bigger EV, the EQE.</p><p>The CLA really is a big step forward on the EV front, and it’s a car that&#39;s hard to fault. The new CLA is hitting dealerships presently, and I have a feeling you&#39;ll be seeing plenty of them on the road soon.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/mercedes-benz-cla-first-drive-head-of-the-ev-class-140000562.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s precisely the challenge <em>Fallout</em> season 2 is facing as the TV series shifts its stage to the irradiated lights of New Vegas when the series returns on <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FLSZBRZJ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bd50a255-8599-4120-8bb3-15cc63ea84bb&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=December+16+at+9PM+ET%2F6PM+PT+on+Prime+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0ZhbGxvdXQtU2Vhc29uLTIvZHAvQjBGTFNaQlJaSj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZDUwYTI1NS04NTk5LTQxMjAtOGJiMy0xNWNjNjNlYTg0YmIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vRmFsbG91dC1TZWFzb24tMi9kcC9CMEZMU1pCUlpKIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAV4Z9pg8n-O45uU24S1tBgg2VJkksWRnokYlq2eFXUHN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFallout-Season-2%2Fdp%2FB0FLSZBRZJ" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Season-2/dp/B0FLSZBRZJ">December 16 at 9PM ET/6PM PT on Prime Video</a>. However, while other video game adaptations like <em>The Last of Us</em> suffered from a bit of a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-two-review-more-zombies-and-more-heartbreak-160007479.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">sophomore slump</a>, <em>Fallout </em>continues to get more crass, vulgar and abrasive in the most entertaining ways.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Editor&#39;s note: We were provided the first six of eight episodes of Fallout season 2 for this review, so if the ending of this season misses its landing, blame The Enclave.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Season two picks up directly after the first as Lucy (played by Ella Purnelle) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) make their way across the wasteland in pursuit of Lucy&#39;s father. And right away, we&#39;re instantly reminded of the magnetic chemistry between our leading lady vault dweller and her endearing naivete and our post-apocalyptic cowboy afflicted with dark pragmatism from having simply lived through too much. This simple combo not only often provides the setup for Lucy&#39;s signature catchphrase — which is both quaint and refreshing — it also sets the stage for some interesting plot points. Just hearing The Ghoul say things like &quot;Do more drugs&quot; with Goggin&#39;s classic drawl and without a hint of irony is a real treat.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2FLimage1_3000.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2FLimage1_3000.jpg" style="height:1255px;width:3000px;" alt="There&#39;s never a dull moment when Lucy and The Ghoul are traveling together. " data-uuid="a985b547-f6d8-4349-927f-54de3adcd265"><figcaption>There&#39;s never a dull moment when Lucy and The Ghoul are traveling together. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Prime Video</div></figure><p>One of the potential pitfalls of a second season though, is an expanded storyline. That&#39;s because unlike the <em>Fallout</em> games where you get to steer the action, we&#39;re just here for the ride as we flip between Lucy&#39;s search for her father, the existential crises facing multiple vaults and an expanded role for Maximus (Aaron Moten) as he suddenly finds himself near the top of the Brotherhood of Steel&#39;s org chart.&nbsp;</p><p>But somehow, the showrunners have managed to make each branching path just as engaging as the others. There were hints of his range in the first season, but Moises Arias shines as Lucy&#39;s brother Norm as the leader of a new crew (I&#39;m trying to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible) while Annabel O&#39;Hagan as Overseer Harper does a fantastic job of switching between being out of her depth and completely unhinged at a moment&#39;s notice.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2FLimage5_3000.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2FLimage5_3000.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="In season two, it feels like Aaron Moten&#39;s Maximus is so close to figuring out what kind of soldier he wants to be. " data-uuid="a3e2f678-fb1d-4f77-a036-81c04e7c6c60"><figcaption>In season two, it feels like Aaron Moten&#39;s Maximus is so close to figuring out what kind of soldier he wants to be. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Prime Video</div></figure><p>The one path that still feels like it hasn&#39;t fully hit its stride is Maximus&#39;, due in large part to the fact that the character&#39;s actions often feel like they are influenced more by circumstance than personal agency. In some ways, it&#39;s the continuation of someone defining their own morality, which rarely feels as convincing or driven as someone with a plan. But there&#39;s still intrigue there too.</p><p>Meanwhile, for fans of the games, the number of easter eggs and callbacks is downright delightful. The set design and cinematography make the wasteland a character in its own right, even if the last thing I want to see is someone eat flea soup. We&#39;re also treated to an ever-growing zoography of nuclear critters such as rad scorpions, all sorts of mutants and more, along with appearances from iconic characters like everyone&#39;s favorite <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Victor_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">cowboy-coded security robot</a>. And I appreciate how the show spends a little extra time to go over the myriad of factions (like The Legion and the NCR), which pays homage to the core series while functioning as an interesting side quest at the same time.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2TBimage7_3000.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2TBimage7_3000.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="With Overseer Harper at the helm, there&#39;s no telling what will happen to Vault 32.

But the pacing isn&#39;t labored, because while the show doesn&#39;t actually get to New Vegas until episode four, the journey there was so entertaining that I didn&#39;t mind. Perhaps most importantly, even though it would be impossible to completely recreate <em>New Vegas</em> on TV (since you can’t choose your own adventure here like you can in the game), it really feels like <em>Fallout&#39;s </em>showrunners have nailed the balance between respecting the source material and tweaking the story to fit a different medium.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s a big credit to the franchise, especially coming from a genre that often gets maligned for a lack of depth or nuance. But it&#39;s also a tribute to this series, which continues to be a prime example of how to make the jump from pixels to TV screens look gook. And after seeing <em>The Last of Us</em> stumble a bit during its second cour, I might even go so far as to say that <em>Fallout</em> is the best live-action video game crossover to date.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>China has taken another step forward in the self-driving car market. The country&#39;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.miit.gov.cn/xwfb/gxdt/sjdt/art/2025/art_f734c7074580470593d4018742997640.html">made its first approval</a> for cars with level-3 autonomous driving capabilities. The two electric sedans come from state-owned automakers Changan Auto and BAIC Motor.</p>
<p>The US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle-safety/automated-vehicles-safety">defines level-3 driving</a> as &quot;the system handles all aspects of the driving task while you, as the driver, are available to take over driving if requested. If the system can no longer operate and prompts the driver, the driver must be available to resume all aspects of the driving task.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a translation of MIIT&#39;s announcement, the Changan vehicle can drive autonomously in single lanes of both highways and urban expressways in traffic congestion. It is allowed solely in certain areas of  Chongqing at a maximum speed of 50 km/h (31 mph). The BAIC electric sedan can also function autonomously on the same roads, but only in areas of Beijing at a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The team strictly followed the standards and procedures to conduct preliminary review, selection, testing, and safety assessments,&quot; MIIT stated. &quot;Both automotive companies have completed and passed the product testing and safety assessments as required.&quot; They didn&#39;t present a timeline for when the models would become available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US approved its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-first-certified-level-3-autonomy-car-company-us-201021118.html">first certified level-3 car</a> in January 2023, a Mercedes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/china-approves-two-level-3-autonomous-evs-134548316.html?src=rss]]></description>

The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently down to $210. That&#39;s $40 off and only $10 more than the record-low price we saw last week. The Pro 3s have been fluctuating in price since Black Friday, with the lowest they&#39;ve been being $199 for a brief period. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation.</p>

<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">the best AirPods</a> available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">Engadget&#39;s review</a> this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &quot;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&quot; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).</p>

To be clear, the game’s new release isn’t a remake or even a remaster — it’s just a port for new consoles so that old and new fans alike can enjoy the game without having to bust out their previous-gen devices. Fans who already own a copy of the game can even get it for free. </p><p><em>Original Sin 2 </em>is the fifth main entry in the Divinity game series. In it, gamers play a sorcerer who can wield forbidden magic and who gets captured by the Magisters of the Divine Order so they can be “cured” of their powers. Players can make their character from scratch, creating their own class and giving their character the abilities, skills and stats they want. But they can also use any of the pre-set characters the game provides.</p><p>Players who already have the 2017 version installed will get a free upgrade applicable to their console. If they don’t have it installed anymore, they can go to game’s store page on their new device and download the upgrade for free — aside from fans in Japan who’ll have to pay ¥100 for the Switch 2 and PS4 upgrade.

The nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow update will come to the moody Metroidvania some time in 2026, and better still, it will be free for all players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DLC will include &quot;new areas, bosses, tools and more,&quot; the developer wrote. There aren&#39;t a lot of clues to the gameplay in the short trailer below, but the four shots definitely relay the vibe. The first shows what looks like fishing tackle, then we see something (or someone) on a tomb-like wooden platform tied under a canvas sheet. Next an orb-like structure crackling with electricity looms and finally the game&#39;s protagonist, Hornet, appears.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time, I refused to upgrade my work-issued MacBook. I was leery of the hassle, and would much rather hang on to an aging Intel-powered laptop than have to transfer files, set up apps and sign in to accounts all over again. What did it matter if my notebook barely lasted long enough to cover an iPhone launch? My petty brain blamed it all on external factors (like being forced to use a MacBook instead of a PC), and left me dripping in stress as I watched the power levels dip down to zero at many of the live events I attend every year. So when I saw the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DCBB2YTR&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f60d172b-bdff-4823-ba90-d510d97102f6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Laptop+Power+Bank&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRENCQjJZVFI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjYwZDE3MmItYmRmZi00ODIzLWJhOTAtZDUxMGQ5NzEwMmY2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRENCQjJZVFIiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWvAradhSm37fVZQjKe0UfTC2cW_0PPGtUP9BrLy72ay&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCBB2YTR" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCBB2YTR?th=1">Anker Laptop Power Bank</a> was one of the items in our Labor Day deals roundup this year, I decided to get one to alleviate my battery anxiety (instead of, you know, doing the sane thing and agreeing to a new laptop).</p>
<p>When I unboxed my new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-laptop-power-bank-review-all-my-favorite-battery-features-together-at-last-130036854.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Laptop Power Bank</a> the night before <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the iPhone 17 Pro launch</a>, I wasn’t expecting to be so taken by its features. All I knew before then was that this was a solid, beefy laptop battery pack, squeezing 25,000mAh in a compact package that would save me from having to worry too much about finding an outlet. But when I saw the screen light up with details on the amount of energy left (to two decimal places!) and the real-time charge data when I plugged it in, I was impressed. How modern!</p>
<p>Then I noticed the built-in cables — one retractable and neatly tucked inside the charger and the other artfully curved into a groove and doubling as a handle. Both wires were braided and felt like they’d be resistant to fraying and destroying themselves over time. Altogether, the general build quality and functionality of all the components made it clear this was a thoughtfully designed product worthy of all the praise and money we’ve hurled at it since my colleagues first tested it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what truly made me smile (and giggle, honestly) was a naughty little <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anker-power-bank-face-easter-egg" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Easter egg</a>. I saw posts on Threads indicating that if you tugged on that retractable cable and let it go in and out a few times, the screen would show a smiley face. I didn’t believe this was true until I saw it for myself. Sure, it felt a little bit odd, but I told myself I was revving a chainsaw, and doing legitimate testing for professional reasons, not jerking off a device. And when I saw the funny face appear, I felt the effect was humorous rather than pervy. The good news for the more staid readers is that if you don’t want to ever see that face, you never have to. And if you like cheeky little touches in your tech products, the Anker Laptop Battery Charger will delight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of how I felt about having pleasured a laptop battery charger, it doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a well-made, well-rounded product. It managed to get my MacBook a few extra hours, so I made it all the way to the end of a multi-hour keynote, though it did run completely empty so I couldn’t recharge my phone after. Blast Apple Park and its utter lack of available power outlets!</p>
<p>Anker’s Laptop Battery Pack effectively allayed my battery anxiety, brought me some mirth and won me over with its thoughtful design. And because I got it on sale, it was $90 well spent.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iRobot, the company that brought robotic vacuum cleaners to homes and popular culture, has filed for  <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html">bankruptcy</a>. It plans to sell all assets to its primary supplier, the Chinese company Picea Robotics. Investors “will experience a total loss and not receive recovery on their investment” if the deal is approved, iRobot said. The company didn’t discuss how the move might affect its employees in the US or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped its $1.7 billion acquisition of the company last year after a veto threat from European regulators, leaving the Roomba maker with no other option. Political scrutiny came on two fronts: The company was also reportedly hit hard by Trump’s tariffs in Vietnam, where it manufactures products for the US market.</p>
<p>iRobot launched its first Roomba in 2002, arguably inventing the world of robot vacuums — and the first robots to enter many of our homes. Competition from rivals has chipped away at its dominance, with other companies coming in at both lower and higher prices, like Roborock, Dyson and Anker’s Eufy.</p>

<p>IKEA’s revamp of its smart home products doesn’t end with Matter support. It also has some new Qi wireless chargers. First up, the $10 VÄSTMÄRKE combines a PopSockets-style phone grip with cable storage in a donut-shaped package.</p>
<p>It can magnetically attach to iPhones with MagSafe or Pixel phones with Google’s Pixelsnap magnets. Then there’s the $25 VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger with lighting, a bowl-shaped charging pad in the center for your smartphone or wireless earbuds.</p>

<p>LG says it will unveil its LG Micro RGB evo TV at CES 2026, but ahead of that, it shared some preliminary information about the screen. Instead of just white lights, Micro RGB means the backlight can be any hue, thanks to individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs, offering a wider color array. This approach is midway between OLED’s individual-pixel lighting and TVs that use typical mini-LEDs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s nothing more frustrating than shooting the perfect reel only to realize that the audio sounds like garbage. For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.<br><br>We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording!</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-phone-mics-for-2026-best-wireless-mics-for-creators">Best phone mics for 2026: Best wireless mics for creators</h2> 
<p>“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera. They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-mobile-microphones">How we test mobile microphones</h2> 
<p>The world of mobile microphones has exploded in recent years thanks to affordable, high-quality wireless systems, the popularity of social media and content creation and, of course, Apple’s reluctant switch to USB-C on the iPhone which has removed connectivity complications for manufacturers.</p> 
<p>When it comes to testing, my experience as a journalist, podcast producer, YouTuber and (failing) music producer has given me a lot of real-world experience with a wide variety of products all aimed at different jobs. When compiling this guide for Engadget, I filter that experience down to a few simple criteria that allows us to focus on what’s important to you, the reader and whatever it is you’re trying to record.</p> 
<p>The main criteria for mobile microphones are simple: Does it sound great? Does it connect to a phone directly and reliably? And, is it good value for its intended purpose? A hobbyist and a professional have different budgets after all.</p> 
<p>What <em>every</em> microphone endures is repeated recording in treated, non-treated and outdoor environments. I’ll also A/B test each one against its rivals and usually a suitable reference microphone — Shure’s SM7b for podcasting microphones or Rode’s NTG 5 for shotgun/video mics, for example.</p> 
<p>Some sub-categories of microphone require a slightly different approach. For wireless systems, I test how far I can walk from the receiver before recordings degrade, along with a standard battery life test by setting them to record until they power off. For podcast and vocal-focused microphones, I record in different spaces to see how they cope with different environments and measure self noise (recording “silence”). Lastly, I test how they sound when recording at different distances from the microphone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss]]></description>

You can also see a list of all the hits you get on your Google account, along with what data breach leaked that particular detail. However, it doesn’t give you guidance on what to do afterwards. </p><p>The company explained that it will focus on tools that can give you clear, actionable step to take instead. Google will stop monitoring for new dark web results on January 15, 2026 and will remove access to the report from your account on February 16.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is getting in on one of the newest trends for televisions with the introduction of Micro RGB. The company will unveil the LG Micro RGB evo at CES 2026, but it shared some preliminary information about the screen today.</p>
<p>Micro RGB is a newer screen technology where rather than white lights, the backlight can be any hue thanks to individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs, offering a wider color array. This approach is a mid-way point between the precision of OLED with its individual pixel lighting, but it offers an upgrade over screens only using mini LEDs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The television is also equipped with an upgraded engine for AI upscaling. According to the company&#39;s press release, the LG Micro RGB evo is certified by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB. The TV has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control.</p>
<p>The few other brands currently using micro RGB are charging a pretty penny for it; the one announced by Samsung earlier this year <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html"><ins>costs $29,999</ins></a>. At 115 inches, the Samsung version is also much larger than LG&#39;s offerings, which include options at 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches. Although the size is reduced, expect the eventual prices for the LG Micro RGB evo to also be very expensive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Louisiana law that would have required social media platforms to verify the ages of their users has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Louisiana-MSJ_Granted.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">been blocked</a> by a judge. The law, known as the Secure Online Child Interaction and Age Limitation, was passed in 2023 and required Meta, Reddit, Snap, YouTube Discord and others to implement age verification and parental control features.</p><p>The ruling came just days before the law, which technically took effect over the summer, would have started to be enforced. In his ruling, Judge John W. deGravelles wrote that the law&#39;s &quot;age-verification and parental-consent requirements are both over- and under-inclusive,&quot; and that its definition of &quot;social media platform&quot; was &quot;nebulous.&quot;</p><p>The ruling was a victory for NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents the tech industry and has challenged the growing number of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">age verification laws</a> around the world. The group had argued that the law was unconstitutional and posed a safety and security risk.</p><p>In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://netchoice.org/netchoice-wins-permanent-block-of-louisiana-age-verification-law-protecting-free-speech-and-parental-rights/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a statement</a> following the ruling, the group pointed to the &quot;massive privacy risk&quot; posed by the Louisiana law and others like it. &quot;Louisiana’s law would have done more than chill speech,&quot; Paul Taske, the co-director of NetChoice’s Litigation Center said. &quot;It would have created a massive privacy risk for Louisianans like those playing out in real time in countries without a First Amendment, like the UK.&quot;</p><p>In a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she would appeal the ruling. “The assault on children by online predators is an all-hands-on-deck problem,” Murrill said. “It’s unfortunate that the court chose to protect huge corporations that facilitate child exploitation over the legislative policy to require simple age verification mechanisms.”</p><p><strong>Update, December 16, 11:50AM PT:</strong> This story has been updated to add a statement from the Louisiana Attorney General’s office.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/judge-blocks-louisianas-social-media-age-verification-law-001212758.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company put its AI chatbot into a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-plan-fizzled-but-it-still-served-a-purpose-130000239.html"><ins>special line of laptops</ins></a> and has also tried to integrate it into other tech products. The latest place you may find Copilot is on your LG smart television, whether you want it or not.</p>
<p>Several LG smart TV owners have taken to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/my_lg_tvs_new_software_update_installed_microsoft/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/tv-providers/lg-tv-update-adds-non-removable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-webos"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> over the past few days to complain that they suddenly have a Copilot app on the device and cannot uninstall it. Two <em>Engadget</em> staffers discovered the app on a 2022 LG OLED and a 2023 UA8000. They confirmed that the app can&#39;t be removed, although they were able to hide it from the home screen. One other person from our team also has a 2022 LG OLED but isn&#39;t seeing Copilot, so your mileage may vary based on what permissions and privacy settings you already have set up with LG.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just last month, Ford seemed to be on the brink of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-may-not-resume-production-of-the-f-150-lightning-221903848.html"><ins>sunsetting</ins></a> the F-150 Lightning. Today, the vehicle manufacturer <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/next-gen-f-150-lightning-extended-range-electric-vehicle"><ins>announced</ins></a> plans to reboot the truck as a hybrid. This next generation of the F-150 Lightning will contain Extended Range Electric Vehicle. An EREV is similar in concept to a plug-in hybrid but with a larger battery that&#39;s topped up by a gas generator — the powertrain itself is all electric. This next generation of the F-150 Lightning will offer an estimated range of more than 700 miles. Production will end this year on the current F-150 Lightning models.</p>
<p>This revamp of the F-150 Lightning is part of Ford&#39;s latest approach to electric vehicles. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-reinvests-trucks-hybrids-affordable-electric-vehicles"><ins>projected</ins></a> that by 2030, half of its global volume will be comprised of hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles, compared with 17 percent today. &quot;As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,&quot; the company&#39;s press release states. Ford will also swap its planned electric commercial van for North America with a new, affordable commercial van that has both gas and hybrid options. The company anticipates seeing a $19.5 billion negative impact for this pivot away from EVs.</p>

<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>So you want to give someone a gift but you don’t have a ton of cash to spare. Don’t fret because first, you’re not alone, and second, there are tons of options to choose from. Especially if you’re looking in the tech space, it can feel especially daunting to find a gadget that’s affordable but also worth gifting — in other words, not a piece of junk that will eventually take up residence at the bottom of a drawer. But you don’t have to drain your wallet to get someone a cool gadget that will both be useful and make their lives easier. We’ve collected our favorite pieces of tech under $25 that make great gifts and help you to stick to a budget.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items. But it would be wrong to think that only the most expensive tech is worth gifting. Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these. However, for the people in your life for which brand names really do matter, these gifts will speak to them.</p>

<p>The year may not be over, but 2025 is all but guaranteed to go down as one of the best 12 months in gaming history. Between releases like <em>Hades 2</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, to name just a few, there was truly something for everyone in 2025. Of course, that abundance also means it can be tricky to find a gift for the gamers in your life, especially if you&#39;re not one yourself. Worry not — Engadget is here to help. We guarantee our guide will help you find the perfect gift for your friend or loved one.</p>

<p>Some moms really do mean it when they say they don’t <em>need</em> any gifts. But those same moms will probably appreciate getting something thoughtful and personal — a gift that shows you put in a bit of consideration. It’s tough to pin-point what that ideal gift is for any given mom, but we’ve got ideas to get you started. Since we spend our days testing and otherwise thinking about tech, most of the presents here have a gadget spin, but all of them are a heck of a lot more unique than a candle and a bath bomb.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not always easy to find gifts for dads, especially for those who are often quick to snap up whatever they need on their own.

<p>Subscription boxes are the rare gift that keeps its charm long after the wrapping paper is gone. You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects. Some appeal to hardcore hobbyists, others to the curious or the comfort seekers, but all offer that same spark of delight that comes from unboxing something unexpected.</p>
