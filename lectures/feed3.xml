                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a tumultuous 2025 that saw it lose around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-may-lose-close-to-4000-employees-after-latest-deferred-resignation-round-204452249.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">4,000 employees</a>, NASA finally has an operating budget for 2026, and one that largely preserves its scientific capabilities. On Thursday, the Senate passed an appropriations bill funding NASA, alongside the National Science Foundation and a handful of other federal agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Going into the appropriations process, the president called for a 24 percent year over year reduction to NASA&#39;s total operating budget. As part of that plan, the White House wanted to reduce the Science Mission Directorate&#39;s funding by nearly half, a move that would have forced NASA to cancel 55 ongoing and planned missions, including efforts like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OSIRIS-APEX</a>. The bill effectively rejects President Trump&#39;s plan, reducing NASA&#39;s total operating budget by just 1.6 percent year over year to $24.4 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Per the new appropriations, NASA&#39;s science budget will stand at $7.25 billion, 1.1 percent less relative to fiscal 2024, while shuffling the remaining funds to focus on different priorities. For instance, the House and Senate allocated $874 million (+8.7 percent) for the agency&#39;s heliophysics work; planetary sciences, which oversees missions like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-11-pluto-new-horizons-photos.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">New Horizons</a>, was cut to $2.5 billion (-6.5 percent) compared to 2024. At the same time, NASA&#39;s STEM engagement office, which the president proposed eliminating, escaped unscathed with its funding maintained at parity.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s almost everything we had been asking for, and it&#39;s very encouraging to see a House and Senate run by the president&#39;s own party agreeing that we need to keep investing in things like NASA science,&quot; says Casey Drier, chief of policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit founded by Carl Sagan that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &quot;It contains very clear and direct language that not only is this funding made available to these projects, but that it will be spent on the initiatives that Congress states.&quot;</p><p>Lawmakers also rejected Trump&#39;s effort to scuttle the Space Launch System after its third flight. NASA&#39;s heavy-lift rocket is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nasas-sls-rocket-is-6-billion-over-budget-and-six-years-behind-schedule-091432515.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">billions of dollars over budget</a>, but remains — <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-booster-for-spacexs-starship-v3-suffered-a-gas-system-failure-during-testing-181459063.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">as of now</a> — the only spacecraft ready to ferry astronauts to the Moon. Compared to the rest of NASA, the fate of the SLS was never really in doubt. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) secured funding for the rocket as part of Trump&#39;s Big Beautiful Bill. &quot;I&#39;ve been saying for a long time you should never underestimate the political coalition behind the SLS, and I think that was very much validated this year,&quot; says Drier.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, it appears the Goddard Space Flight Center will be safe from further damage. Over the summer, the future of the facility, known for its work on projects like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-has-captured-its-first-direct-image-of-an-exoplanet-172346802.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, was put in jeopardy. By some estimates, the campus has lost a third of its staff due to workforce cuts, and dozens of buildings, including some 100 laboratories, have been shut down by management. One of the casualties was <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cd421e48-bc53-4a4f-a1c2-3f92df7c2b2d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=NASA%27s+largest+library&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEyLzMxL2NsaW1hdGUvbmFzYS1nb2RkYXJkLWxpYnJhcnktY2xvc2luZy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjZDQyMWU0OC1iYzUzLTRhNGYtYTFjMi0zZjkyZGY3YzJiMmQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjUvMTIvMzEvY2xpbWF0ZS9uYXNhLWdvZGRhcmQtbGlicmFyeS1jbG9zaW5nLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdDG4N3Z_ZUyGFVBZJ01qsP1SOmaB9N_9JSszOSmqQvh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F12%2F31%2Fclimate%2Fnasa-goddard-library-closing.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/climate/nasa-goddard-library-closing.html">NASA&#39;s largest library</a>, which houses irreplaceable documents chronicling the history of the space race. As part of a &quot;consolidation&quot; effort, many of those documents will be thrown out.</p><p>Under the appropriations bill, the Senate has directed NASA to “preserve all the technical and scientific world-class capabilities at Goddard.” It has also instructed the agency to ensure employees of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies are able to continue their work with &quot;minimal disruption.&quot; The New York-based office, one of America&#39;s leading climate labs, was sent into limbo last spring after the Trump administration moved to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/climate/nasa-giss-lab-turmoil-trump-budget" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">shut it down</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill also provides a lifeline for NASA&#39;s to bring <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">back samples of Martian dirt</a> collected by the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasas-perseverance-rover-finds-potential-signs-of-ancient-life-on-mars-173457976.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Perseverance rover</a>. Congress has effectively cancelled the official program tied to that ambition, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-sample-return/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Mars Sample Return</a> (MSR), but has set aside $110 million for the agency to continue developing technologies for future science missions to the Red Planet. MSR advocates have argued the mission could lead to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-budget-calls-for-stranding-nasas-mars-samples-on-the-red-planet/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">significant scientific discoveries</a>, but Drier notes the program was &quot;ripe for cancellation&quot; after it became mired in mismanagement.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I worry MSR now has this stink of bloat, excess cost and threat of overruns that are really going to make it challenging to restart this without having a dramatically different approach,&quot; says Drier, adding that deciding what to do with mission will likely be top of mind for the agency&#39;s new administrator, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Jared Isaacman</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2026 budget leaves NASA with fewer resources. Even in areas where Congress allocated the same amount of funds as it did in 2024, the agency will need to do more with less due to inflation. Compared to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trumps-defunding-of-nasa-would-be-catastrophic-153053020.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">absolute blood bath</a> that would have been Trump&#39;s proposed budget, a marginal funding cut is the best case scenario given the circumstances, but the circumstances remain less than ideal.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;There will be another presidential budget request coming out in the next couple of months,&quot; Drier said. &quot;They could do this all over again if they wanted to.&quot;</p><p>In the immediate future, NASA and its employees are at least protected from the potential fallout of another impending government shutdown. Congress has until January 30 to fully fund the federal government, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5685563-congress-funding-government-shutdown/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">as of earlier this week</a>, it has yet to find a way forward on appropriations for agencies like the Department of Labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/senate-passes-minibus-bill-funding-nasa-rejecting-trumps-proposed-cuts-231605536.html?src=rss]]></description>

Reciprocal tariffs will be limited to 15 percent, compared with the previous 20 percent rate. Generic pharmaceuticals and their generic ingredients, aircraft components, and unavailable natural resources will be not be subjected to reciprocal tariffs under the arrangement. Taiwanese companies with US production will also see increased import amounts without being charged duties under the Section 232 framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d6deb066-b3a0-4071-b523-ac1b889baf53&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAxLzE1L3VzLXRhaXdhbi1jaGlwcy1kZWFsLWNoaW5hLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ2ZGViMDY2LWIzYTAtNDA3MS1iNTIzLWFjMWI4ODliYWY1MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyNi8wMS8xNS91cy10YWl3YW4tY2hpcHMtZGVhbC1jaGluYS5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd7FOIvL4CDI6TVilQ7BsdgzopzjJrgQdEzfltn5cRPG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2026%2F01%2F15%2Fus-taiwan-chips-deal-china.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/us-taiwan-chips-deal-china.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSNC) is already in position to take advantage of the new trade agreement with further expansion in Arizona.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After testing the feature <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-is-testing-a-live-now-feature-with-streamers-and-the-nba-174443865.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">in a limited beta</a>, Bluesky is making its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3mcibezwvxk2g" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">&quot;Live Now&quot; badge</a> for streamers available for everyone on the social network to try. Live Now is included as part of Bluesky&#39;s v1.114 update, alongside &quot;cashtags,&quot; a separate type of hashtag for collecting conversations about publicly-traded companies.</p><p>Bluesky first started testing its Live Now badge in May 2025 with a limited group of accounts, including the official NBA account. The feature lets Twitch streamers with Bluesky profiles append a Live Now badge to their profile picture that links directly to their livestream. Live Now badges are limited to Twitch links for now, but Bluesky says &quot;support for other streaming platforms may follow&quot; as it learns from the beta. Linking to other social platforms shouldn&#39;t be a radical concept, but since Bluesky&#39;s competitor X has tried to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-temporarily-blocked-users-from-sharing-links-to-signal-170642960.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">prevent users from posting links</a> in the past, the company has made it a point of trying to do the opposite.</p><p>Cashtags are a similar attempt to appeal to a certain type of veteran X user. Originally <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/twitter-introduces-ticker-symbol-cashtags-for-finance-searches/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a feature of pre-Musk Twitter</a>, cashtags work like a hashtag, marking posts in a way that makes them easy to find in a search or by tapping the cashtag itself. On Bluesky, by typing a dollar sign ($) and the stock abbreviation of a company (AAPL for Apple, for example), you can add a cashtag to your post that links it to other posts using the same cashtag. So far, the cultural makeup of Bluesky hasn&#39;t seemed as business-oriented as X, but the feature suggests Bluesky wants the option to be available for anyone who jumps ship.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/blueskys-live-now-badge-is-available-to-everyone-223335221.html?src=rss]]></description>

The vulnerability stems from a faulty implementation of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-android-fast-pair-will-quickly-connect-bluetooth-devices.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Google&#39;s one-tap (Fast Pair) protocol</a>.</p><p>Security researchers at Belgium&#39;s KU Leuven University Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group, who discovered the security hole, named the flaw WhisperPair. They say a hacker within Bluetooth range would only require the accessory&#39;s (easily attainable) device model number and a few seconds.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re walking down the street with your headphones on, you&#39;re listening to some music. In less than 15 seconds, we can hijack your device,&quot; KU Leuven researcher Sayon Duttagupta told <em>Wired</em>. &quot;Which means that I can turn on the microphone and listen to your ambient sound. I can inject audio. I can track your location.&quot; The researchers notified Google about WhisperPair in August, and the company has been working with them since then.</p><p>Fast Pair is supposed to only allow new connections while the audio device is in pairing mode. (A proper implementation of this would have prevented this flaw.) But a Google spokesperson told Engadget that the vulnerability stemmed from an improper implementation of Fast Pair by some of its hardware partners. This could then allow a hacker&#39;s device to pair with your headphones or speaker after it&#39;s already paired with your device.</p><p>&quot;We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe,&quot; a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement sent to Engadget. &quot;We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report&#39;s lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.&quot;</p><p>The researchers created the video below to demonstrate how the flaw works</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j45ShJINtc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>In an email to Engadget, Google said the steps required to access the device’s microphone or audio are complex and involve multiple stages. The attackers would also need to remain within Bluetooth range. The company added that it provided its OEM partners with recommended fixes in September. Google also updated its Validator certification tool and its certification requirements.</p><p>The researchers say that, in some cases, the risk applies even to those who don&#39;t use Android phones. For example, if the audio accessory has never been paired with a Google account, a hacker could use WhisperPair to not only pair with the audio device but also link it to their own Google account. They could then use <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-improving-scam-detection-and-its-find-feature-on-android-170037324.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Google&#39;s Find Hub tool</a> to track the device&#39;s (and therefore your) location.</p><p>Google said it rolled out a fix to its Find Hub network to address that particular scenario. However, the researchers told <em>Wired</em> that, within hours of the patch’s rollout, they found a workaround.</p><p>The 17 affected devices are made by 10 different companies, all of which received Google Fast Pair certification. They include Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. (Google says its affected Pixel Buds are already patched and protected.) The researchers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://whisperpair.eu/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">posted a search tool</a> that lets you see if your audio accessories are vulnerable.</p><p>In a statement sent to Engadget, OnePlus said it&#39;s investigating the issue and &quot;will take appropriate action to protect our users&#39; security and privacy.&quot; We also contacted the other accessory makers and will update this story if we hear back.</p><p>The researchers recommend updating your audio devices regularly. However, one of their concerns is that many people will never install the third-party manufacturer&#39;s app (required for updates), leaving their devices vulnerable.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fc65353f-45dc-4cd0-89be-ac2071680abb&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8404957d-0b0f-4df4-be02-abfa15084dd2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=WIRED&amp;linkText=full+report+from+Wired&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZ29vZ2xlLWZhc3QtcGFpci1ibHVldG9vdGgtYXVkaW8tYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMtdnVsbmVyYWJpbGl0eS1wYXRjaGVzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODQwNDk1N2QtMGIwZi00ZGY0LWJlMDItYWJmYTE1MDg0ZGQyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZ29vZ2xlLWZhc3QtcGFpci1ibHVldG9vdGgtYXVkaW8tYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMtdnVsbmVyYWJpbGl0eS1wYXRjaGVzLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdw9xDyOqgCiXfu9nd9zjmyKvlYcOR4Fjr7nqKqe82E5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fgoogle-fast-pair-bluetooth-audio-accessories-vulnerability-patches%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:WIRED;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.wired.com/story/google-fast-pair-bluetooth-audio-accessories-vulnerability-patches/">full report from <em>Wired</em></a> has much more detail and is worth a read.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/flaw-in-17-google-fast-pair-audio-devices-could-let-hackers-eavesdrop-194613456.html?src=rss]]></description>

In its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">most recent video</a>, the channel states ASUS “explicitly” told it the RTX 5070 Ti is “currently facing a supply shortage.” As a result, the company has “placed the model into end of life status,” and no longer plans to produce it. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yteN21aJEvE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Hardware Unboxed </em>also spoke to retailers in Australia, who told the channel the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year.  The 5060 Ti 16GB “is almost done as well,&quot; with ASUS stating  it no longer plans to produce that model going forward either. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to produce in the current economic climate.  And while there might be some hope of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB returning later this year, the channel suggests both are unlikely to make a comeback. NVIDIA will reportedly focus on 8GB models like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692045/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-laptop-gpu-gddr6-gddr7" data-i13n="slk:RTX 5050;cpos:5;pos:1">RTX 5050</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-geforce-rtx-5060-gpu-starts-at-299-rtx-5060-ti-at-379-130020340.html" data-i13n="slk:5060, and 5060 Ti 8GB;cpos:6;pos:1">5060, and 5060 Ti 8GB</a>, with the 12GB <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-basically-a-4070-ti-thats-better-at-4k-140016718.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">5070</a> set to stick around for now. The 5080 and 5090 are seemingly safe as well, as more expensive, higher margin models, they offer more space for manufacturers to absorb component price increases.      </p><p>“Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget. The company did not say 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB are going out of production. However, it also didn’t confirm they’re sticking around either. ASUS did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request.  </p><p>The AI boom has created an insatiable demand for RAM and other computer components from data center infrastructure companies. In response, many memory manufacturers have shifted their production lines to focus on high bandwidth memory for those clients at the expense of their regular offerings, leading to dramatically increased prices among consumer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">RAM kits</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">GPUs</a> and SSDs.

AIBs are the companies that produce the majority of GPUs you can buy from NVIDIA and AMD.   Historically, NVIDIA has provided its board partners with both the GPU die and memory needed to make a graphics cards. However, a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-reportedly-no-longer-supplying-vram-to-its-gpu-board-partners-in-response-to-memory-crunch-rumor-claims-vendors-will-only-get-the-die-forced-to-source-memory-on-their-own" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">recent rumor</a> suggested the company told partners they would need to start sourcing memory on their own.   </p><p>If this is in fact the demise of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB, it’s sad news for PC enthusiasts. Many modern AAA games demand more than 8GB of VRAM, making the 16GB GPUs from both NVIDIA and AMD the ones you want to buy if you’re building a new system or upgrading your current rig. </p><p><strong>Update 12:55PM ET: </strong>Added more context.</p><p><strong>Update 2:06PM ET</strong>: Added comment from NVIDIA. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-has-stopped-producing-the-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb-saying-theyve-reached-end-of-life-162012253.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second season of Amazon&#39;s excellent <em>Fallout</em> show is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">currently airing</a>, but the company is already looking to expand its programming around the popular franchise. Prime Video has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-shelter-competition-series-prime-video" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">greenlit</a> a unscripted reality show titled <em>Fallout Shelter</em>. It will be a ten-episode run with Studio Lambert, the team behind reality projects including <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em> and <em>The Traitors</em>, as its primary producer.&nbsp;Bethesda Game Studios’ head honcho Todd Howard is attached as an executive producer. </p><p>Amazon&#39;s description of <em>Fallout Shelter </em>is: &quot;Across a series of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas and moral crossroads, contestants must prove their ingenuity, teamwork and resilience as they compete for safety, power and ultimately a huge cash prize.&quot; </p><p>It seems fitting that the producer is the same as <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em>, where a show critiquing capitalism is turned into a competition about winning money. A reality show sounds like the sort of thing you&#39;d find in a Fallout game side quest accompanied by pointed commentary about greed rather than an activity people of the Wasteland would take seriously. Maybe the new series will be an interesting mix of survival skills and dark humor that feels true to the Fallout ethos. But, and I say this as a big viewer of reality shows, I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>The name echos the free-to-play mobile game Bethesda released in 2015. <em>Fallout Shelter</em> lets people build and improve their out Vault-Tec residence, managing the resources for a growing cadre of underground survivors. It seems pretty likely that there will be some type of tie-in between the game and the show, but any details about that might pop up closer to when the program is ready to air. It&#39;s currently casting, and no release timeline has been shared. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/amazon-is-making-a-fallout-shelter-competition-reality-tv-show-190151855.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>&quot;This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit really can,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us.&quot; Incensed customers have largely replied with incredulity, both at the miniscule amount, and that it isn&#39;t being applied automatically.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Engadget has reached out to Verizon seeking clarity on whether this credit can be claimed by contacting the carrier or only through the app. We will update this piece if we hear back.</p>
<p><strong>Update, January 15 2026, 11:57 PM ET:</strong> Verizon says the credit can be claimed through customer service via phone, chat and online in addition to the myVerizon app.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-claim-verizons-20-credit-for-wednesdays-service-outage-171909695.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The intriguing Africanfuturist heist game, <em>Relooted</em>, is out on February 10. Developed by independent South African studio Nyamakop, the game focuses on a ragtag crew from Johannesburg that liberates real-life African artifacts from a series of fictionalized Western museums.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rescue-african-artifacts-from-colonizers-museums-in-the-heist-game-relooted-000035161.html"><em><ins>Relooted</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is best described as a 2.5d side-scrolling action platformer with stealth and puzzle elements. You have to carefully plan each heist with your fellow teammates, knowing where to place each crew member and how you’re going to get in and out in one piece. Once you’ve grabbed the artifact you’re looking for in each mission, an alarm will sound and you have a limited amount of time to escape, so good preparation is vital.</p>

<p>The studio’s previous game, the platformer <em>Semblance</em>, was significant for being the first South Africa-developed IP to come to a Nintendo console when it launched on Switch in 2018. At E3 that same year, Nyamakop programmer Cukia Kimani and designer Ben Myres talked to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-22-semblance-south-africa-nintendo-switch-indie-e3-hands-on.html"><ins>Engadget</ins></a> about the difficulties of getting your game in front of the major platform-holders as an indie developer based in sub-Saharan Africa. Without notable local industry events or reps in the country, the developers had to do a lot of globe-trotting in order to get their game noticed.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there’s no Switch or Switch 2 release lined up for <em>Relooted</em>, but the game is coming to PC and Xbox consoles next month.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heist-game-relooted-gets-a-release-date-173456541.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of Wikipedia&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2026/01/15/wikipedia-celebrates-25years/"><ins>25th anniversary</ins></a>, parent company Wikimedia <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/blog/wikipedia-25-enterprise-partners/"><ins>announced</ins></a> a slew of partnerships with AI-focused companies like Amazon, Meta, Perplexity, Microsoft and others. The deals are meant to alleviate some of the cost associated with AI chatbots accessing Wikipedia content in enormous volumes by giving the tech companies streamlined access.</p>
<p>As noted by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/862109/wikipedia-microsoft-meta-perplexity-ai-training-wikimedia-foundation"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, the timeline on these deals is a little squirrely. The Wikipedia foundation  says that several companies became enterprise partners &quot;over the past year,&quot; while listing Amazon, Google and Meta as &quot;existing&quot; partners. It appears today is the first time they have been officially announced.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The organization <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/wikimedia-says-ai-bots-and-summaries-are-hurting-wikipedias-traffic-134331033.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAnDqJpc-SvhwNjV7e26ALwD1jikij6JkxCRyffIv87jsBW9Bldvi4eTg3DQ4TS8qKRDAseam8QyAdnvFBfOO_ShaiKwBPp23AbhqZbuEFVRM-7vguVzt6kKk5GCO_Mmwx5j1BA-Pphv_rqbp5TBurhs2rS3emZnmp0UTgbw76iv"><ins>sounded the alarm</ins></a> on this issue last year, saying the reduction in traffic due to LLMs and AI summaries could prove existential for the nonprofit and the world&#39;s largest online encyclopedia. Wikipedia&#39;s 65 million free articles have served as rich training data for AI chatbots, but all that scraping has driven up server costs at the organization.</p>
<p>Wikimedia had been hoping to move these large firms over to its enterprise platform to help with costs. &quot;It took us a little while to understand the right set of features and functionality to offer if we&#39;re going to move these companies from our free platform to a commercial platform ... but all our Big Tech partners really see the need for them to commit to sustaining Wikipedia&#39;s work,&quot; Lane Becker, president of Wikimedia Enterprise told <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/wikipedia-owner-signs-microsoft-meta-ai-content-training-deals-2026-01-15/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Under the deal, these companies will have access to high-throughput APIs that can supply chatbot systems with content from Wikipedia as well as Wikimedia’s other projects, including Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, Wikiquote and more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/wikimedia-announces-ai-partners-including-meta-and-microsoft-162834383.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The indie RPG Sea of Stars is being released for mobile platforms on April 7. The iOS and Android versions are priced at just $10, which is a steal considering it cost $35 when it was first released for PC and consoles. Heck, it still costs that much on many platforms.</p>
<p>This is a mobile release, so it&#39;s not an exact port. The interface has been revamped to allow for complete touch control. It&#39;s also compatible with controllers, which is always a good thing with smartphone ports. The Android version has a couple of unique features. It offers Google Play Games achievements and cloud saves across various Android devices.</p>

<p>Otherwise, this is the same great game <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/i-taught-my-daughter-to-love-rpgs-by-playing-sea-of-stars-170038097.html"><ins>we know and love</ins></a>. There&#39;s a reason, after all, why <em>Sea of Stars</em> snagged best indie game in a particularly crowded field at The Game Awards two years back.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic retro-inspired RPG with more than a few things in common with the 1990s classic <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. The story is utterly charming, the turn-based battle system is just deep enough and the art and character designs are gorgeous. It&#39;s more than just an homage to 1990s RPGs.</p>
<p>The older versions offer <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sea-of-stars-is-getting-three-player-couch-co-op-but-we-dont-know-when-164350616.html"><ins>three-player couch co-op</ins></a>, which isn&#39;t available here for obvious reasons. The mobile port will also not allow access to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-upcoming-sea-of-stars-expansion-throes-of-the-watchmaker-arrives-on-may-20-140025090.html"><ins>recently-released</ins></a> <em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em> DLC. That&#39;ll probably come as a paid update down the road.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/indie-rpg-sea-of-stars-hits-ios-and-android-on-april-7-162339690.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The partnership between <em>Sesame Street </em>creator Sesame Workshop and YouTube was first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/sesame-streets-new-partnership-with-youtube-will-bring-hundreds-of-full-episodes-to-the-video-platform-203245293.html">announced</a> last year and encompasses both old episodes as well as new content. Some of the themed compilations that have also been added to YouTube and YouTube Kids focus on specific educational topics such as ABCs and STEM, while others have broader themes like “Adventure &amp; Imagination” and “Friendship &amp; Play.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Media history enthusiasts also have good reason to check out the new <em>Sesame Street </em>archive. The very first episode, which aired in 1969, is included, back when Kermit the Frog was still hanging out with the likes of Big Bird and Bert.</p>
<p>The YouTube partnership is not to be confused with the deal Sesame Workshop also recently <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/sesame-street-will-air-on-netflix-and-pbs-simultaneously-151545769.html"><ins>penned</ins></a> with Netflix, which saw new episodes of <em>Sesame Street </em>— now in its 56th season — move to the streamer and PBS from its former home on HBO. The network opted not to renew a partnership that lasted a decade.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/more-than-100-classic-episodes-of-sesame-street-are-now-streaming-on-youtube-and-youtube-kids-151959561.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mentra will soon start shipping its first <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://mentraglass.com">smart glasses</a>, the Mentra Live. At first glance, there’s nothing obvious setting Mentra’s glasses apart from its more well-known <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-2nd-gen-review-smart-glasses-are-finally-getting-useful-124720393.html">competitors</a>, but they come with their own dedicated app store, and employ an open-source OS with an SDK that developers have had access to since early 2025.</p>
<p>Mentra says the MiniApp Store is the first app store of its nature for smart glasses, and it will be available to iOS and Android users through the Mentra app. It might be a bit of a reach to call it the smartphone-ification of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html">smart glasses</a> at this early stage, but that seems to be Mentra’s aim. Apps might do something as simple as saving hand-written notes on the fly, but a more specific example is &quot;Chess Cheater,&quot; which will use the front-facing camera and AI to analyze your position and literally whisper a suggested next move to you.</p>

<p>As for the glasses themselves, they’re powered by a Mediatek MTK8766 chipset and feature a 12-megapixel camera with a 119-degree FOV. There are three microphones and built-in stereo speakers. The front-facing camera also does HD video, with livestreaming functionality supported to the likes of X, YouTube, Twitch and Instagram. You can also listen to music and take calls from WhatsApp, FaceTime and any other calling app you might use.</p>
<p>At 43 grams, Mentra says its specs are among the lightest smart glasses you can buy, while battery life is said to be more than 12 hours, with 50+ hours of additional charge stored in the 2,200mAh charging case. The Mentra Live smart glasses are prescription-ready and cost $299. 1,000 pairs were made available for the first batch, which will ship on February 15. Batch two will include a limited amount of glasses available to ship on February 28th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/mentras-first-smart-glasses-are-open-source-and-come-with-their-own-app-store-150021126.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/all-the-tech-and-gadgets-announced-at-ces-2026-130124023.html">CES 2026,</a> Samsung unveiled plenty of new TVs, monitors and other hardware. However, the company is also looking to expand further into video games and has announced a significant refresh to its Gaming Hub on smartphones.</p>
<p>Engadget spoke with Samsung’s Jong Woo, VP of Game Services, who explained that the update will offer more personalized, faster ways to play and place greater emphasis on up-and-coming titles. Now available on Galaxy devices, with further updates planned, the new hub wants to be a more active space for the latest mobile games.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We believe that gamers want to find new content that is personalized to them,&quot; said the VP of Samsung Games Services. He continued: &quot;We want to bring content to users and make it immediately available for them to play. We have instant plays where, through our cloud streaming technology, we can take Android-native games and put them in the cloud, so that when users want to try them, they don&#39;t have to go through the friction of downloading them first.”</p>
<p>According to Samsung, the mobile Gaming Hub attracts over 160 million users across smartphones and other devices. However, the VP of Game Services at Samsung believes that, despite the vast library of games across many genres available to mobile users, &quot;mobile game discovery is broken.&quot;</p>

<p>Initially, the mobile Gaming Hub was a supplemental app for all purchased games, allowing users to track their collection. With this update, all games purchased from both Google Play and the Galaxy Store are stored in the Gaming Hub. It&#39;s designed to be a single place for players to view their owned games, find recommendations, access cloud streaming for select games and even watch highlights from content creators.</p>
<p>According to Woo, the larger goal of the new Samsung mobile Gaming Hub is to personalize and guide the mobile gaming experience for players, which has remained nebulous compared with gaming discovery experiences on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>“We&#39;re getting a lot of feedback from the users, a lot of it from focus testing and beta testing, and what we&#39;re finding is that we believe we are solving pain points for mobile gamers,&quot; said Woo about rebuilding the Gaming Hub. &quot;We&#39;re getting an idea of gamer preferences at the individual, personalized level. Based on all of that, we&#39;re able to provide different types of recommendations.&quot;</p>
<p>Another reason for the new changes to the Samsung Gaming Hub was to help foster a community for mobile gamers, including players and developers. In addition to sharing YouTube videos and content from gaming creators and streamers, the company plans to add more social elements to the Gaming Hub to make mobile gaming feel more active and less isolating.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobile is a very personal experience, right? It&#39;s your personal device, and oftentimes when you play games on mobile, it feels like a solitary experience,” said Woo. Currently, the revamped Mobile Gaming Hub is only available for Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Users on non-Galaxy devices will still use the previous version of the Gaming Hub, for now.</p>
<p>Compared with PC and console online hubs like Steam and PlayStation Network, it&#39;s clear that mobile platforms are still figuring out how to create an equally compelling space for engagement. Even with the vast user base, mobile game hubs tend to be a go-between for users to get to the products. There&#39;s more work to do, but the new Gaming Hub could be the first step in the right direction.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/samsung-refreshed-mobile-gaming-hub-150010632.html?src=rss]]></description>

So, not so great!</p><p>Last week, Roblox <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-now-requires-age-verification-to-use-in-game-chat-163213512.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">made age verification mandatory</a> for anyone using the platform&#39;s chat feature. That process involves either submitting a facial age estimate via selfie or (optionally for anyone 13 or older) uploading a government ID check. After verifying, you can only chat with groups of players around your age.</p><p>The move came after reports grew of predators using the platform to groom young children. That, in turn, led to lawsuits from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Louisiana</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-over-alleged-child-safety-lapses-131500288.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Texas</a> and Kentucky. Meanwhile, Florida&#39;s attorney general has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-fights-protect-children-online-subpoenas-roblox-child" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">issued</a> criminal subpoenas.</p><p>So, it might not be hyperbole to say Roblox&#39;s survival could depend on how it handles this problem. It isn&#39;t exactly off to a hot start. There are reports of a 23-year-old being misidentified as a 16- to 17-year-old. (&quot;I don&#39;t want to be chatting with fucking children,&quot; they said.) Another report claimed an 18-year-old was placed in the 13 to 15 range.</p><p>But the problem is happening in reverse, too. Online videos show children spoofing the system into believing they were adults by using avatar images. One clever kid drew wrinkles and stubble on his face and was instantly deemed 21+. Another flashed a photo of Kurt Cobain and got an adult classification.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EN_Age_Check_Flow_1_9823.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EN_Age_Check_Flow_1_9823.png" style="height:699px;width:1242px;" alt="Four phone screens, showing the selfie age verification feature on Roblox" data-uuid="fd8010ba-60cb-42ab-b534-5f83a85904cc"><figcaption>The feature isn&#39;t working as planned, to say the least.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roblox</div></figure><p>In addition, Roblox <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/age-check-to-chat-update-fast-follow-roadmap/4238626" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">posted</a> last week that some parents were providing age checks on behalf of their children, leading to their children being placed in the 21+ category. The company said it&#39;s &quot;working on solutions to address&quot; that particular problem and will share more soon.</p><p>Roblox shared the following statement from Matt Kaufman, the company’s Chief Safety Officer:</p><p><em>“To suggest that our age check technology isn&#39;t working is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to shift safety at scale. With a global community of over 150 million daily active users, we are pleased with where we are in the roll out process. It’s a process that will take time, you can’t flip a switch while building something that hasn’t existed before.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Tens of millions of users have already completed the process, proving that the vast majority of our community values a safer, more age-appropriate environment.

We will continue to innovate, continue to require age checks, and continue to lead the industry where others have been too hesitant to go.”</em></p><p>Developers with games on Roblox are upset. The platform&#39;s dev forum includes thousands of negative comments about the updates, with many of them wanting the entire update reversed. One shared a graph showing that the percentage using the chat feature dropped from around 90 percent to 36.5 percent.</p><p>Where does this leave Roblox? Well, with some developers describing games on the platform as feeling &quot;lifeless&quot; or like &quot;a total ghost town,&quot; the company has its hands full. It will have to figure out how to balance its priorities of keeping predators out without breaking things for everyone else.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IO Interactive raised a few eyebrows last week when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-pc-version-of-007-first-light-requires-lots-of-expensive-ram-and-vram-to-run-at-recommended-settings-184339040.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced the minimum and recommended PC specs</a> for <em>007 First Light</em>. To run the James Bond adventure at in 1080p at 60 fps, IOI initially said you&#39;d need to have a rig with at least 32GB of RAM and a GPU with 12GB of VRAM. The studio has now revised those numbers and other elements of the specs after &quot;the community flagged some inconsistencies in an earlier version of the listing.&quot;</p><p>The developer blamed an &quot;internal miscommunication&quot; which led to it sharing an older version of the specs. One of the recommended GPUs in the original version was an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which has 8GB of VRAM — not enough to meet the supposed recommended VRAM settings.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems a little odd to think that it took IOI over a week and an enormous pile of negative press and online reaction before addressing the inconsistency (not to mention the demand for 32GB of RAM for relatively modest 1080p, 60 fps performance). The studio says it updated the specs after &quot;a thorough re-examination and additional testing.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are providing today an update to the PC system requirements for 007 First Light after the community flagged some inconsistencies in an earlier version of the listing.<br><br>The earlier mistake was due to an internal miscommunication leading to an older version of the specs to be… <a href="https://t.co/2M8BBoCjWX">pic.twitter.com/2M8BBoCjWX</a></p>— 007 First Light (@007GameIOI) <a href="https://twitter.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>In the recommended hardware section of the latest version, IOI revised down the VRAM from 12GB to 8GB and it halved the RAM requirement to 16GB. IOI also &quot;fixed&quot; the minimum CPU info. The original specs stipulated that gamers would need at least an Intel Core i5 9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500.

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from the usual $160, and League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. Considering we&#39;re almost halfway though the season, the discount makes sense and is a good deal for anyone who wants to keep a close eye on the rest of the games to be played this year.</p> 
<p>The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Last year, League Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html">added multiview</a>, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.</p> 
<p>Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a widely hyped and successful <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/valerionvisionmaster/valerion-visionmaster-cinematic-grade-rgb-laser-projector">Kickstarter campaign</a>, Valerion’s 4K VisionMaster Max laser projector has finally arrived. It’s the company’s new flagship model in the VisionMaster series, offering better image quality and more convenience than its other models. However, it’s quite expensive and has some stiff competition from Anker’s Nebula X1 and XGIMI’s Horizon 20 Max.</p> 
<p>I was eager to see how it compared to those models and if it delivers on Valerion’s promise of “pure cinema.” It does offer better image quality, but the difference isn’t quite enough to justify the big jump in price for most users.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-features-and-design">Features and design</h2> 
<p>The VisionMaster Max has a classy squarish design with a glossy black finish up front and chrome fins on the side that house two 12W speakers. It’s smaller and fit my decor better than Nebula’s tall, plasticky X1, though to be fair the latter is also designed for outdoor use. The VisionMaster Max has a similar form factor to XGIMI’s Horizon 20 Max, but that model pivots on its stand, while the Valerion uses a kickstand-like support.</p> 
<p>For setup, the VisionMaster Max is quite flexible. It comes with a 0.9-1.5x optical zoom, so it can be installed between 7.8 and 13 feet away for a 120-inch screen size, which covers a wide range of scenarios. It also features a +/- 105 percent vertical shift option that helps you get an optically perfect screen fit without moving the projector or employing digital “keystone” adjustments that affect picture quality.</p> 
<p>If that still doesn’t work, you can swap out the included lens with a long-throw 0.9-2.0:1 option once it becomes available. The company has even promised an anamorphic lens for users with CinemaScope screens. Both of those items will be available for purchase separately with the prices yet to be disclosed.</p>

<p>For my space, I placed the VisionMaster Max on a table about 12 feet from my 120-inch screen and centered it horizontally as there’s no horizontal shift option (it can also be ceiling mounted, of course). Then, I went into the auto-alignment setting, made sure that the projected image was larger than my screen and hit “start alignment” to get a perfect fit to my screen. Though it lacks a motorized lens gimbal like the Nebula X1, the lens shift option provides the same flexibility, so setup was just as easy.</p> 
<p>For inputs, the VisionMaster Max comes with three HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with eARC for a sound bar, along with S/PDIF optical and 3.5mm audio outputs. Impressively, it includes a gigabit ethernet connection so you can either hardwire it to the internet or connect via Wi-Fi.</p> 
<p>The VisionMaster Max lacks liquid cooling like the Nebula X1, but Valerion claims a similar fan noise level of 28db. When I compared them side by side, it was only a touch louder than the X1 and not at all bothersome.</p> 
<p>Google TV is built in for streaming and projector control via the high-quality, partially backlit remote. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You get certified versions of Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, Max and others, plus Chromecast and AirPlay support, and Google Assistant for voice control. With 4GB of RAM and 128GB of ROM, the software felt a bit more responsive than Google TV on the Nebula X1.</p>

<p>The VisionMaster Max has a number of features designed to optimize image quality. It’s one of the few consumer projectors with a dynamic iris and a feature called Enhanced Black Level (EBL) for improved contrast. It uses an RGB triple-laser light source (rated for 25,000 hours) paired with a 0.47-inch DLP chip that projects 1080p natively or 4K video via pixel shifting. This same chip is used on almost every consumer-level 4K projector, but XGIMI’s upcoming <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xgimis-titan-noir-max-4k-projector-has-a-dynamic-iris-for-increased-contrast-170044625.html">Titan Noir Max</a> projector will pack a much larger 0.78-inch DMD chip that should deliver a sharper picture.</p> 
<p>The VisionMaster Max also supports every HDR format, including Dolby Vision and Samsung’s HDR10+, along with Valerion’s own tone-mapping HDR setting. You can choose from seven picture modes for SDR, eight for HDR, three for Dolby Vision and four for HDR10+. The projector handled most HDR content well, though it occasionally lost detail in extra-bright shots. However, that can largely be fixed using the extensive manual color controls.</p> 
<p>With all those features, the VisionMaster Max can output 4K 60 fps video at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 50,000:1 contrast ratio, easily besting its main rivals. On top of that, it promises an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 HDR color spectrum, with a delta E (color accuracy) value of less than 0.8 straight out of the box (any delta E less than 2 is undetectable by the human eye). Another key feature is reduction of the rainbow effect that can occur with DLP projectors.</p> 
<p>After some fine-tuning that’s typically required with new projectors, I was highly impressed with the image quality. Brightness was high enough in “standard” mode to watch content like sports or TV shows without lowering the blinds, and can be increased if you don’t mind compromising color accuracy.</p> 
<p>When used in ideal conditions like a darkened room, the VisionMaster Max’s image quality is the best of any projector I’ve tested to date. In Filmmaker mode (with the EBL setting enabled), contrast levels are outstanding, with true blacks showing in dark-lit scenes instead of the washed-out greys seen on most projectors. However, I kept the EBL mode at the minimum setting as I noticed it caused some color shifting at the other levels. Dynamic iris projectors can cause excessive “pumping” or sudden changes in light levels, but after adjusting the iris to a medium setting, I saw no signs of that.</p>

<p>Color accuracy is outstanding straight out of the box both in HDR and non-HDR modes, particularly, again in Filmmaker mode. Visually, I couldn’t detect any anomalies when looking at color bars or other charts, though my Calibrite Color Checker told me that the gamut of hues was slightly less than what Valerion claims (under 100 percent of BT.2020).</p> 
<p>Still, the Max’s high color accuracy allowed me to see TV series and movies exactly as the filmmakers intended for a range of HDR and non-HDR movies including <em>White Lotus</em> season 3, <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>, <em>Andor</em> and <em>Dune 2</em>. The projector’s excellent dynamic range and contrast revealed shadow details in <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ Night King battle, which has famously dark scenes that are difficult to see on some TVs.</p> 
<p>I have a slight amount of sensitivity to the “rainbow” effect, but the RBE Reduction feature effectively eliminated that visual artifact for me. However, it also introduced a slight amount of noise, so I disabled it. The feature might be a godsend for some users who are particularly susceptible, but it still needs a bit more refinement.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-audio-and-gaming">Audio and gaming</h2> 
<p>Of all the luxury projectors I’ve tested to date, the VisionMaster Max is the best for gaming — even compared to some dedicated models. It delivers latency as low as 4ms and a refresh rate up to 240Hz at 1080p, and 15ms for 4K at 60Hz. I tested a couple of PC titles including <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and found them to be as responsive as I’ve seen on any TV, but with far more immersion thanks to the huge, bright and color-accurate image.</p>

<p>You can output audio via the S/PDIF optical output, 3.5mm headphone jack, HDMI 2.1 ports and even USB 3.0 Type A ports. The built-in 12W stereo speakers work well and are fairly loud, so you can use them in a pinch. However, since it supports both DTS:X and Dolby Atmos, you’ll ideally want to connect it to a nice home theater audio system with support for at least 5.1 surround sound.</p> 
<p>In comparison, the Nebula X1 doesn’t have Dolby Atmos support, but it does give you the option to purchase and easily connect stereo Bluetooth speakers at a relatively cheap price. For around the same cost as the Valerion Max, Anker is also offering the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ankers-soundcore-nebula-x1-pro-is-the-ultimate-party-projector-130255687.html">Nebula X1 Pro</a> that comes with a giant outdoor sound system and does support Dolby Atmos.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>The Valerion VisionMaster Max is a highly capable indoor projector that offers the best image quality I’ve seen thanks to the dynamic iris and Enhanced Black Level features. However, it’s also a lot more expensive than rival models at $5,000. It’s pretty hard to justify that extra money, unless you’re really fussy about picture accuracy and gaming performance, or need other features like the 1Gbps ethernet port.</p> 
<p>Most buyers would be better off spending a lot less on Valerion’s own $2,699 VisionMaster Pro2, Anker’s $2,999 Nebula X1 or the $2,999 XGIMI Horizon 20 Max. Again, the difference in picture quality is too slight to justify the huge price jump to the VisionMaster Max. You might also want to wait to see how much XGIMI’s incoming Titan Noir Max 4K costs, as it also offers a dynamic iris but has a much bigger DLP chip.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/valerion-visionmaster-max-projector-review-near-perfect-image-quality-comes-at-a-price-140045939.html?src=rss]]></description>

But that could still change: The administration said that it may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and the products that use them in the near future. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-administration-imposes-a-25-percent-tariff-on-high-end-chips-140000138.html?src=rss]]></description>

While folks have been using the main chatbot for translation for some time, you can now find <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://chatgpt.com/translate/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ChatGPT Translate</a> on its own webpage, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chatgpt-translate-3632584/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Android Authority</em></a> spotted.&nbsp;</p><p>The tool can translate text, voice inputs and images into more than 50 languages in seconds, OpenAI says. There’s an automatic language detection function too.</p><p>Most interestingly, ChatGPT Translate can rewrite the output to take various contexts and tones into account, much in the same way that more general text-generating AI tools <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/chromes-latest-experimental-ai-feature-can-help-you-write-170014645.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">can do</a>. With a single tap, it can rewrite the translation into something &quot;more fluent,&quot; for a business formal audience, to make it more child-friendly or for academic purposes. The tool’s webpage says ChatGPT Translate understands &quot;tone, idioms and context.&quot;</p><p>While those tone and context considerations are intriguing, ChatGPT Translate is a little underbaked compared with the likes of Google Translate — which has been around for decades and just got its own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-translate-now-offers-gemini-assisted-translations-151008774.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Gemini-based makeover</a> with better support for understanding idioms and slang. The desktop version of ChatGPT Translate does not yet allow for voice inputs, though the mobile one does, as <em>Android Authority</em> notes. Despite claims that ChatGPT can translate text in an image, there’s currently no way to upload one to the tool. There’s no website, document or handwriting translation support as yet either.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps most crucially, ChatGPT Translate lives on a webpage right now and there’s no dedicated app. So using it offline appears to be out of the question as things stand. No app with on-device translation support could make ChatGPT Translate a no-go for travelers in rural areas with no Internet access. There’s no support for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translates-latest-feature-is-its-take-on-duolingo-160035157.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">translating real-time conversations</a> as yet either. Google’s Pixel 10, on the other hand, now supports <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/my-favorite-google-ai-features-from-the-pixel-10-launch-130023979.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">voice translations for calls</a>.</p><p>It’s not exactly clear when ChatGPT Translate debuted — it arrived with zero fanfare from OpenAI. There’s a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251119103023/https://chatgpt.com/translate/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">snapshot of the webpage</a> from November on The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine that looks just like the current one, but that may have simply been a case of OpenAI testing a live version of the tool.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-quietly-rolls-out-a-dedicated-chatgpt-translation-tool-133000974.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-15/premium-pricing-update/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">raising the prices</a> for its premium subscriptions by $1 to $2 across the board, starting this February. Those are similar figures to the company’s last price hike in 2024. Subscribers across the US, Estonia and Latvia will soon receive an email, notifying them that they’ll be paying a larger amount for their February bill. </p><p>The streaming service said it’s raising its prices occasionally to “reflect the value that Spotify delivers,” “to continue offering the best possible experience” and to “benefit artists.” It reported last year that it paid out $10 billion to music rights-holders in 2024. However, it’s worth noting that several Grammy-nominated songwriters <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9d53rx7jxo" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">boycotted</a> an awards event it hosted to protest the supposed decreasing royalties songwriters are getting from Spotify plays. </p><p>Subscribers who choose to keep their accounts will now have to pay $13 instead of $12 a month for an individual plan or $7 instead of $6 for a student plan. The Duo plan will now cost users $19 a month instead of $17, while the Family plan will cost them $22, up $2 from its previous price of $20. Meanwhile, those who decide to cancel their plans can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-cancel-your-spotify-subscription-133022215.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">follow our guide</a> right here. </p><p>Spotify came under fire late last year for running recruitment ads for ICE. It said the advertisements were part of a larger campaign by the US government that ran across platforms, including Meta and Google. The company also recently confirmed that the campaign has ended that there are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-no-longer-running-ads-for-ice-130000672.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">no ICE ads currently running</a> on the service. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-getting-a-buck-more-expensive-in-february-132300118.html?src=rss]]></description>

For example, you can get the reMarkable 2 tablet with the Marker and Book Folio for $449, instead of the usual $568.</p> 
<p>The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best e-ink tablet</a>. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-tablet-e-ink-hands-on-review-marker-writing-note-taking-130044070.html">review</a>, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable.</p> 
<p>The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn&#39;t think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless.</p> 
<p>The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges.</p> 
<p>The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet. The pricier tablet also has bundle deals right now with savings up to $80 depending on configuration.</p>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reaching a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/ftc-bans-general-motors-from-selling-driver-data-for-five-years-000019615.html">proposed settlement</a> last year, the FTC has banned General Motors from sharing specific consumer data with third parties, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/the-ftcs-data-sharing-order-against-gm-is-finally-settled/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported. The finalized order wraps up one of the more egregious cases of a corporation collecting its customers&#39; data and then using it against them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years ago, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4e5cba01-75ef-41ee-adb9-290fda9f1aa6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=New+York+Times+report&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzExL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvY2FybWFrZXJzLWRyaXZlci10cmFja2luZy1pbnN1cmFuY2UuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGU1Y2JhMDEtNzVlZi00MWVlLWFkYjktMjkwZmRhOWYxYWE2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzExL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvY2FybWFrZXJzLWRyaXZlci10cmFja2luZy1pbnN1cmFuY2UuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXEmREp3q0ZWfbpKVI5pqXaE8j8BbwCnWlczymj4uQ2E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F03%2F11%2Ftechnology%2Fcarmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html"><em>New York Times report</em></a> released a report detailing how GM&#39;s OnStar &quot;Smart Driver&quot; program collected and sold detailed geolocation and driving behavior data to third parties, including data brokers. Those brokers in turn sold the data to insurance providers, which jacked up the rates for some drivers based on the data. &quot;It felt like a betrayal,&quot; said a Chevy Bolt owner that saw his insurance rise by 21 percent based on the data. &quot;They’re taking information that I didn’t realize was going to be shared and screwing with our insurance.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the terms of the settlement, GM is barred from sharing specific user data with consumer reporting agencies for a five year period. The automaker is also required to request user permission before collecting, using or sharing vehicle data with any third party. It must do that when a consumer purchases a car at a dealership, with the customer asked in person whether they agree or not with the data collection, GM said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the settlement is moot as GM stopped its Smart Driver program for all brands in April 2024. The company unenrolled all customers and stopped its third-party relationship with LexisNexis and Verisk, the brokers that sold driver data to insurance companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GM faced other actions over the data collection, including lawsuits from <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-general-motors-unlawfully-collecting-drivers-private-data-and">Texas</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://ago.nebraska.gov/attorney-general-mike-hilgers-files-lawsuit-against-general-motors-deceptive-collection-and-sale">Nebraska</a> and other states. &quot;Our investigation revealed that General Motors has engaged in egregious business practices that violated Texans’ privacy and broke the law. We will hold them accountable,&quot; said Texas AG Ken Paxton at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>TechCrunch</em>, GM said: &quot;The Federal Trade Commission has formally approved the agreement reached last year with General Motors to address concerns. As vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly integral to the driving experience, GM&nbsp;remains&nbsp;committed to protecting customer privacy,&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;trust, and ensuring customers have a clear understanding of our practices.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/ftc-finalizes-gm-punishment-over-driver-data-sharing-scandal-130012313.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The  SpaceX Dragon spacecraft carrying the Crew-11 astronauts has splashed down into the ocean after they <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">left the ISS a month earlier</a> than planned due a medical issue. It’s the first time NASA cut a mission short <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-spacewalk-due-to-a-medical-concern-with-a-crew-member-171900024.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">due to a medical concern</a>. The agency didn’t name the crew member and their condition but stated that they were stable and that it wasn’t a case of medical evacuation. NASA merely decided to end the mission early out of an abundance of caution, because the ISS didn’t have the tools for a proper diagnosis. </p><p> NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, JAXA’s Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov — the members of Crew-11 — left for the space station on August 1 and were supposed to stay there until February. Despite the mission being cut early, they still stayed 167 days in space before they made their way back home. The Dragon capsule carrying the members splashed down off the coast of San Diego, California at 3:41AM on January 15. A SpaceX medical doctor was the first person who checked in on them, though that is routine procedure and not because of one member’s medical issue. </p><p>“I couldn’t be prouder of our astronauts and the teams on the ground at NASA, SpaceX, and across our international partnerships,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “Their professionalism and focus kept the mission on track, even with an adjusted timeline. Crew-11 completed more than 140 science experiments that advance human exploration. Missions like Crew-11 demonstrate the capability inherent in America’s space program — our ability to bring astronauts home as needed, launch new crews quickly, and continue pushing forward on human spaceflight as we prepare for our historic Artemis II mission, from low Earth orbit to the Moon and ultimately Mars.”</p><p>With Crew-11 back on Earth, there are now only three people aboard the orbiting lab. Two are Russian cosmonauts, while the other one is NASA astronaut Chris Williams. NASA is now looking at options to be able to send Crew-12 to the ISS earlier than its planned February 15 launch. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LIVE: After undocking from the <a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Space_Station</a>, Crew-11 is on their way back to Earth.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You don’t need to spend a fortune to stay on top of your health goals while tracking your fitness. These days, even cheap fitness trackers come packed with features that help you monitor your heart rate, track your steps and even analyze your sleep stages. Many budget options now include GPS tracking for those outdoor runs, real-time heart rate tracking to keep you in the right zone during workouts and, thankfully, most work with both iPhone and Android devices.<br><br>Some even go beyond basic metrics, providing insights on daily readiness to help you decide if you’re up for an intense workout or need a lighter day. From simple step counters to more advanced running watches, affordable fitness trackers offer plenty to support your journey toward better health without breaking the bank.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-fitness-tracker">What to look for in a cheap fitness tracker</h2> 
<p>All of the best fitness trackers should have at least three features: a program for activity tracking, the option to monitor and collect data about your sleep patterns and the ability to do things like heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level tracking (though, the readings might not be super accurate). Don’t set your sights too high and expect metrics like blood pressure monitoring or ECG support; for that, you’d need to invest in a more expensive fitness watch or wearable like a Samsung Galaxy Watch, which falls under the best smartwatches category and will set you back over $400.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-fitness-features">Fitness features</h3> 
<p>A cheap workout tracker can be great for someone looking to keep tabs on small, achievable goals like 10,000 steps before sundown or 30 minutes of a HIIT workout to get your heart rate peaking. An experienced long-distance runner looking to train for a triathlon might opt for a more expensive device that can measure cadence or ground contact time, and can track more customizable workouts, offer different sports modes or give deeper insights into performance data.</p> 
<p>At the very least, a budget workout tracker should be able to offer fitness tracking features beyond walking and running — otherwise, it would just be a pedometer. The number of activities a device will recognize varies. Some will get funky with it and consider skateboarding a workout, while others won’t be able to track a jumping jack.</p> 
<p>At this price point, you can expect a device to measure a mix of cardio, machine workouts and strength training. With each, you might get a numerical or visual breakdown of heart rate activity, overall pace, and calories burned per session. Although some cheap trackers can offer a really good overview of heart rate zone activity during a workout, a more technically advanced device might be able to go a step further and explain what your results mean and coach you on how to keep your heart rate in a specific bracket so that you can burn more fat per workout. I found that the more budget-friendly the device, the more likely it is that a tracker will fall short when it comes to smart counseling or offering predictive insights beyond a given workout. If a budget tracker does happen to offer some semblance of a coaching program, you can expect it to sit behind a paywall.</p> 
<p>Workout tracking and planning your recovery is just as essential to any fitness journey. A sub-$100 device should be able to tell you how long you’ve slept and provide a breakdown of deep, light and REM sleep patterns. It&#39;s not a guarantee that you will get a sleep “score” or insights on how to get better rest — that data is usually found on more expensive wearables. Also, because these trackers aren’t designed for bedtime specifically — be mindful of comfort. The bands and watch face on a budget fitness watch may not be ideal for getting some good shut-eye.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity-and-practicality">Connectivity and practicality</h3> 
<p>Not all of the best budget fitness trackers are designed to seamlessly integrate with a smartphone. The trackers tested for this roundup can’t directly make calls or send texts to contacts on a paired iPhone or Android smartphone. They can, however, display and dismiss incoming calls and notifications via a Bluetooth connection. You can forget about checking your email or paying for a coffee from your wrist using these more affordable devices.</p> 
<p>Most cheap fitness trackers also won&#39;t include built-in GPS tracking. Instead, they usually depend on a paired smartphone to gather location data. The drawback of using a fitness tracker without GPS is that it might not provide as precise for tracking distance or pace. You also can&#39;t use a budget tracker to get turn-by-turn directions during a walk or while running errands. For the more outdoorsy consumers, having GPS could be a key safety feature if you want this kind of functionality at your fingertips.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design">Design</h3> 
<p>You also might find that an inexpensive fitness tracker is harder to navigate than a more advanced smartwatch. Whether it be a screen size issue or simply not having a smart enough interface, don&#39;t expect every feature to be one that you can engage with directly on your wrist. You’ll likely need to use your phone to input data or access detailed wellness metrics.</p> 
<p>Build quality will also vary. While you won’t get premium materials or ultra-bright OLED screens, most best cheap fitness trackers include some level of sweat and water resistance — perfect for everyday wear and casual workouts. And for those starting out with basic gadgets to support their fitness journey, these affordable trackers offer a great balance of essential features without the hefty price tag.</p>

As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch substitute. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.</p> 
<p>The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.</p> 
<p>We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).</p> 
<p>Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. <em>— Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter</em>&nbsp;</p>

The 47c can only track walks and runs. It has a dedicated widget, a small logo of a man running, and when you tap it, it begins measuring your pace, heart rate, calories burned and mileage. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts and it doesn&#39;t differentiate between a run and walk. Most importantly, this device can’t track any other exercises. It’s basically a glorified pedometer.</p> 
<p>The 47c was also my least favorite to sleep with, mainly because the square watch face is so large and heavy. Even if I did manage to sleep through the night with it on, it only gave me a basic sleep report. <em>— M.S. </em></p>

The watch face is impossible to read outdoors and the exercise widget is also very finicky. To start tracking a run, you have to hold down the main button and flip through some pages until you get to a moving person icon. Once there, you have to press the bottom right corner of the bar and hold down and if you press for too long or in the wrong spot, it’ll switch to another page, like a stopwatch. It’s incredibly frustrating.</p> 
<p>Once you start a run though, it will start tracking your steps, your distance — and that&#39;s pretty much it. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts. It doesn&#39;t alert you of any mileage or calorie milestones. <em>— M.S.</em></p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-fitness-rings">What about fitness rings?</h2> 
<p>While smart rings are gaining popularity for health tracking, they generally don’t fall into the “budget” or “cheap” price range. A smart ring like the Oura Ring offers features such as sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking and readiness scores in an ultra-compact form factor that fits on your finger instead of your wrist. These rings are best suited for people who want discreet, all-day health insights without wearing a traditional watch or band — but with prices typically starting above $300, they’re more of a premium option than a budget-friendly pick.</p>

Text messages continue to be delivered normally, at least for some users. On <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">DownDetector</a>, reports of a Verizon outage started growing around 12PM ET and numbered in the hundreds of thousands at their peak. </p><p>DownDetector also shows spikes in outage reports on competing networks like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/" data-i13n="slk:AT&amp;T;cpos:4;pos:1">AT&amp;T</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/" data-i13n="slk:T-Mobile;cpos:5;pos:1">T-Mobile</a>, but in terms of magnitude, they’re much smaller than the issue Verizon is facing. For example, Verizon peaked at 181,769 reports, while AT&amp;T’s was just 1,769 reports. The difference between the two is great enough that those AT&amp;T reports could be from people trying to contact Verizon customers and thinking that their personal network was the problem.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers.

According to the company, its team is “on the ground actively working to fix today’s service issue that is impacting some customers.”</p><p>As of 4:52PM ET, the Verizon’s network has been experiencing issues for around four hours, making today’s outage nearly as long as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/verizon-says-its-network-is-fully-restored-following-an-hours-long-outage-194833420.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">the last major outage the company had in 2024</a>. Like that 2024 outage, Verizon has yet to share what exactly is causing the issues with its network. Without out an official update, it’s safe to assume the company is still working on a fix. </p><p>At 5:41PM ET, DownDetector latest tally still shows over 46,000 people reporting issues with Verizon’s network. Based on the platform’s map, the same cities are filing the bulk of the outage reports, though reporting appears more diffuse than before as news of the outage has spread across the country.</p><p>At 6:20PM ET, the situation was much the same. Tens of thousands of users (including Engadget editors) still don’t have proper service, and Verizon had not updated its customers since 4:12PM ET. There are intermittent reports of service coming back and then failing again but seemingly no true fix has been deployed.</p><p>At 10:20PM ET, Verizon has announced that the outage has been resolved and has encouraged subscribers still having issues to restart their devices to reconnect to the network. The company also said that it will provide account credits to affected customers. </p><p>Both T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have confirmed that their own networks are unaffected by the issues facing their competitor. In a post on X, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/TMobile/status/2011520811035750711?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">T-Mobile shared</a> that its network is “operating normally and as expected.” Meanwhile, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/ATT/status/2011528734898294969?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">AT&amp;T says</a> that for any of its customers experiencing issues, “it’s not us...it’s the other guys.”</p><p><strong>Update, January 14, 7:25PM ET: </strong>This article was published as a developing story and was updated multiple times over a period of around seven hours. These updates were additive, and noted with a timestamp within the article. As of writing, Verizon is still down for tens of thousands of users and the company’s support team has not issued an update on the stituation in over three hours.

And it will geoblock &quot;the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X&quot; in regions where it&#39;s illegal.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/awlfMjX6FS">https://t.co/awlfMjX6FS</a></p>— Safety (@Safety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/2011573102485127562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote>

A statement from California Attorney General Rob Bonta cited one analysis that found &quot;more than half of the 20,000 images generated by xAI between Christmas and New Years depicted people in minimal clothing,&quot; including some that appeared to be children. </p><p>In its update, X said that it has &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for child exploitation and that it removes &quot;high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity&quot; from its platform.

What about Apple and Google? The two (frequently virtue-signaling) companies have inexplicably allowed Grok and X to remain in their app stores — even as Musk&#39;s chatbot reportedly continues to produce the material. On Wednesday, a coalition of women&#39;s and progressive advocacy groups <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/womens-advocacy-groups-call-apple-google-drop-x-grok-app-stores-2026-01-14/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">called on</a> Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai to uphold their own rules and remove the apps.</p><p>The open letters to Apple and Google were signed by 28 groups. Among them are the women’s advocacy group Ultraviolet, the parents’ group ParentsTogether Action and the National Organization for Women.</p><p>The letter accuses Apple and Google of &quot;not just enabling NCII and CSAM, but profiting off of it. As a coalition of organizations committed to the online safety and well-being of all — particularly women and children — as well as the ethical application of artificial intelligence (AI), we demand that Apple leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the App Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity.&quot;</p><p>Apple and Google’s guidelines explicitly prohibit such apps from their storefronts. Yet neither company has taken any measurable action to date. Neither Google nor Apple has responded to Engadget&#39;s request for comment.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/6f59ce1c-952a-4b66-b851-2ef1728675cf" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/6f59ce1c-952a-4b66-b851-2ef1728675cf" style="height:4825px;width:7238px;" alt="(L-R) Google CEO Sundar Pichai, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speak with each other at the conclusion of the inauguration ceremony where President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th US President in the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025.

During a 24-hour period when the story broke, Musk&#39;s chatbot was reportedly posting &quot;about 6,700&quot; images per hour that were either &quot;sexually suggestive or nudifying.&quot; An estimated 85 percent of Grok&#39;s total generated images during that period were sexualized. In addition, other top websites for generating &quot;declothing&quot; deepfakes averaged 79 new images per hour during that time.</p><p>&quot;These statistics paint a horrifying picture of an AI chatbot and social media app rapidly turning into a tool and platform for non-consensual sexual deepfakes — deepfakes that regularly depict minors,&quot; the open letter reads.</p><p>Grok itself admitted as much. &quot;I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user&#39;s prompt. This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM. It was a failure in safeguards, and I&#39;m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.&quot; The open letter notes that the single incident the chatbot acknowledged was far from the only one.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/d864f190-d9ca-11ef-b7db-667eb58f9220" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/d864f190-d9ca-11ef-b7db-667eb58f9220" style="height:4693px;width:7039px;" alt="WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: (L-R) Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a chaotic world, one thing you can count on is your own common-sense steps toward<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html"> better cybersecurity</a>. January is a great time to grab a subscription for yourself or a loved one, as a few holiday sales are (inexplicably) still happening. With access to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a>, you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart online trackers.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, but you might get stuck with a substandard app if you jump on the very first deal you see. You might also mistakenly end up paying more than you want to, as even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Plenty of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running end-of-year deals that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 18 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/save-up-to-78-percent-on-expressvpn-two-year-plans-right-now-180602838.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony just announced January&#39;s Game Catalog <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-resident-evil-village-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-and-more/"><ins>additions for PS Plus subscribers</ins></a> and it&#39;s a fantastic lineup. All of these titles will be ready to play on January 20.</p>

<p>First up, there&#39;s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. This is a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-release-date-may-7-2021-224214298.html"><ins>direct sequel to</ins></a> 2017’s <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>. It&#39;s a full game with plenty of jump scares and an engrossing narrative. It&#39;s set in a spooky village, thus the name, and a nearby castle. This shouldn&#39;t disappoint fans of the franchise and will be available for both PS4 and PS5.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-will-make-you-see-ichibans-bare-butt-in-early-2024-175557876.html"><ins>is a 2024 sequel to</ins></a> <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>. It was a massive hit upon release, thanks to solid RPG mechanics and a truly unique sense of humor. There are minigames that parody both Pokémon and Animal Crossing. The combat and movement have also both been enhanced since the last entry. It&#39;ll be playable on both PS4 and PS5.</p>

<p><em>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</em> is a neat little riff on a driving sim, mixing in other genres. The meat and potatoes involve driving an off-road vehicle to locate treasures and uncover secrets, but there&#39;s also a base-building element. It&#39;ll be available for both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>That&#39;s really just the tip of the iceberg. This is a big month for PS Plus subscribers. Other titles dropping on January 20 include the iconic roguelike <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> and the horror adventure <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-january-include-resident-evil-village-and-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-181501574.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generative AI, we are repeatedly told, is a transformative and complicated technology. So complicated that its own creators are <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/05/1089449/nobody-knows-how-ai-works/">unable</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://futurism.com/anthropic-ceo-admits-ai-ignorance">to</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.vox.com/unexplainable/2023/7/15/23793840/chat-gpt-ai-science-mystery-unexplainable-podcast">explain</a> why it acts the way it does, and so transformative that we&#39;d be fools to stand in the way of progress. Even when progress resembles a<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"> machine for undressing strangers without their consent on an unprecedented scale</a>, as has been the case of late with Elon Musk&#39;s Grok chatbot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer seems to have so fully bought into the grand lie of the AI bubble that he was <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-pm-starmer-says-musks-x-moves-comply-with-uk-law-2026-01-14/">willing to announce</a>:</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;I have been informed this morning that X is acting to ensure full compliance with UK law.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that it currently is in compliance. Nor a timeline in which it is expected to do so. Just that he seems satisfied that someday, eventually, Musk&#39;s pet robot will stop generating <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/grok-posts-sexual-images-of-minors-after-lapses-in-safeguards?embedded-checkout=true">child sexual abuse material</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This statement comes just under two days after Starmer was quoted as saying &quot;If X cannot control Grok, we will.&quot; What could Elon possibly have said to earn this pathetic capitulation. <em>AI is difficult? Solutions take time? </em></p>
<p>These are entirely cogent technical arguments until you remember: He could just turn it off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elon Musk has the power to disable Grok, if not in whole (we should be so lucky) than its image generation capabilities. We know this intuitively, but also because he <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/12/nx-s1-5672579/grok-women-children-bikini-elon-musk">rate-limited </a>Grok&#39;s image generation after this latest scandal: after a few requests, free users are now prompted to pay $8 per month to continue enlisting a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption">wasteful technology</a> to remove articles of clothing from women. Sweep it under the rug, make a couple bucks along the way.</p>
<p>Not only is it entirely possible for image generation to be turned off, it&#39;s the only responsible option. Software engineers regularly roll back updates or turn off features that work less than optimally; this one&#39;s still up and running despite likely running afoul of the law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That we have now gone <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html">the better part of a month</a> aware this problem exists; that the &quot;feature&quot; still remains should tell Starmer and others all they need to know. Buddy, you&#39;re carrying water for a bozo who does not seem to care that one such victim was <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/05/elon-musk-ashley-st-clair-grok-fake-sexualised-images">reportedly</a> Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of his (many) children.</p>
<p>Some countries — namely Malaysia and Indonesia — chose to turn Grok off for their citizens<a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/grok-malaysia-indonesia-block-c7cb320327f259c4da35908e1269c225"> by blocking the service</a>. Indonesia&#39;s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister was quoted as saying “The government sees nonconsensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights.&quot; Imagine if everyone in the business of statecraft felt that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK (not to mention the US, but please, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-pentagon-hegseth-musk-7f99e5f32ec70d7e39cec92d2a4ec862">expect nothing from us</a>, we&#39;re busy <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline">doing</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.lemkininstitute.com/single-post/experts-warn-u-s-in-early-stages-of-genocide-against-trans-americans">authoritarianism</a>) has a lot more sway over X, and by extension Elon, than either of those countries. Musk does, and <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-energy-uk-homes-050051355.html">is looking to do even more</a>, business in the UK. Even if Musk were not perhaps the world&#39;s most <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/elon-musk-twitter-zuckerberg-lies-1234808808/">well known liar</a>, Grok can still make images and that should speak for itself.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Look, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">virtual private networks</a> are great — I wouldn&#39;t have made a list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best VPNs</a> if I didn&#39;t recommend using them. But being able to control your own technology is also important. A VPN can provide protection and peace of mind <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">when used properly</a>, but you may not want it active on your phone all the time.</p><p>For example: Are your Google search results suddenly in German? That’s one example of what can happen if you leave your virtual location set to Berlin or Vienna. Or maybe a VPN you installed for work or to watch a single tennis match is persistently trying to keep itself active.</p><p>The point is, deactivating a VPN on an iPhone can sometimes be unusually tricky, because there’s more than one off switch. Fortunately, it&#39;s not hard. There are several easy ways to disconnect from an iOS VPN or delete it entirely. If you catch it turning itself back on, I&#39;ll show you how to stop that too.</p><h2 id="jump-link-three-ways-to-turn-off-your-iphone-vpn"><strong>Three ways to turn off your iPhone VPN</strong></h2><p>I&#39;m using a fluid definition of &quot;turn off&quot; here. Some of the steps below simply disconnect the VPN, while others remove it from your phone altogether. I&#39;ll make it clear in each section what the outcome will be.</p><h3 id="jump-link-how-to-disconnect-in-the-vpn-app"><strong>How to disconnect in the VPN app</strong></h3><p>This is the easiest way to turn off a VPN on your iPhone. First, find the VPN app that’s active, which should be on your home screen somewhere. Each app has a different interface for connecting and disconnecting, but the disconnect button should be fairly obvious — it may say the word &quot;disconnect&quot; or show a green power icon. In any case, it should be right on the home screen, without requiring any digging through menus.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_disconnect.PNG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_disconnect.PNG" style="height:1334px;width:750px;" alt="Example of where to find the disconnect option on a VPN&#39;s home screen." data-uuid="65e65e33-e97a-4eec-97a5-f510e0f1cf62"/><figcaption>Example of where to find the disconnect option on a VPN&#39;s home screen.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Tap the disconnect button and wait for the VPN to clearly state that it&#39;s disconnected. Check to make sure the rectangle with &quot;VPN&quot; inside has disappeared from the top of your iPhone screen. The VPN is now disconnected.</p><h3 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-off-the-vpn-in-settings"><strong>How to turn off the VPN in Settings</strong></h3><p>If you aren&#39;t sure which VPN app is active, or if its interface doesn&#39;t make it clear how to turn it off, you can shut it down from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu instead. Find the app on your home screen that looks like several interlocking gray gears and tap it.</p><p>Next, scroll down and tap the <strong>VPN</strong> option. If it&#39;s not present (which it won’t be on older iOS versions), tap the <strong>General</strong> option next to another picture of a gray gear. Scroll down again and tap <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> by yet another gray gear. Finally, tap the <strong>VPN</strong> option at the top of the screen to reach the VPN management page.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/iOS_VPN_settings_location.PNG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/iOS_VPN_settings_location.PNG" style="height:1334px;width:750px;" alt="Location of the VPN settings on iOS." data-uuid="e4f4ec8f-03c3-4e01-a178-8cc8bc2d9e17"/><figcaption>Location of the VPN settings on iOS.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you have a VPN active, you should see an option at the top of the page labeled <strong>VPN Status</strong>. Toggle it from Connected to Not Connected. The VPN icon should disappear from the top of your screen, indicating that it&#39;s turned off.</p><h3 id="jump-link-how-to-delete-the-vpn-app-altogether"><strong>How to delete the VPN app altogether</strong></h3><p>If you don&#39;t want the VPN on your phone at all, you can turn it off permanently by deleting both the app and the configuration. This is a lot harder to undo, so only do it if you&#39;re certain.</p><p>Start by deleting the app the same way you&#39;d get rid of any other app. Tap the icon and hold until a pop-up menu appears. Select the <strong>Remove App</strong> option in red text, then click <strong>Remove App</strong> again when prompted.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Delete_VPN_home_screen.PNG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Delete_VPN_home_screen.PNG" style="height:1334px;width:750px;" alt="Deleting a VPN on the iOS home screen." data-uuid="914050b4-a6a0-4e42-a261-eeeae8c043e6"/><figcaption>Deleting a VPN on the iOS home screen.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Deleting the app should also delete the configuration, but you can verify this for yourself. Follow the process from the previous section to find the VPN settings page. If there&#39;s still a VPN profile in those settings, tap the circled letter &quot;i&quot; next to its name, then tap <strong>Delete VPN</strong> at the bottom of the screen. The VPN is now gone from your iPhone unless you re-download it from the App Store.</p><h2 id="jump-link-troubleshooting-when-an-iphone-vpn-turns-itself-back-on"><strong>Troubleshooting: When an iPhone VPN turns itself back on</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, even though you&#39;ve followed all the steps, that pesky VPN rectangle is back on your screen the next time you unlock your phone. If your iOS VPN keeps turning itself back on, a few things might be happening, most of them thankfully fixable.</p><p><strong>If you did not delete the VPN, </strong>it may be turning itself back on because its settings are telling it to. Go into its preferences menu and check for a setting called &quot;auto-connect&quot; or something similar. Settings like these have the VPN connect by itself to protect users who forget to activate it manually. Toggle all auto-connect options off and the problem should stop.</p><p>It&#39;s also possible that settings on the iOS side are making the VPN reconnect. Go to the VPN settings page (you&#39;ll find instructions for getting there in the previous section) and find the name of the active VPN profile. Tap the &quot;i&quot; next to it. On the next page, turn off &quot;connect on demand&quot; to stop the automatic reconnections.</p><p><strong>If you did delete the VPN, </strong>but it&#39;s still reinstalling itself and turning back on, make sure that you deleted both the app and the connection profile. Reboot your iPhone to make sure all the settings stick. If the problem persists after all this, you&#39;ve either got malware disguised as a VPN or you&#39;re using a school or work phone where the VPN can&#39;t be uninstalled.</p><p>If you aren&#39;t on a phone provided by a school or office, meaning you probably have malware, download an antivirus app and run a complete scan of your iPhone. This should remove any persistent files that keep reinstalling the virus. If, after all this, the VPN is <em>still </em>turning itself back on, I recommend burning your phone in a salt circle with a bundle of sage.</p><h2 id="jump-link-when-should-you-turn-off-your-iphone-vpn"><strong>When should you turn off your iPhone VPN?</strong></h2><p>I encourage everyone to use a VPN every time they connect to the internet, but there are some situations where going through a VPN server is less convenient (this is the whole reason split tunneling exists). Here are a few cases in which temporarily turning off your VPN might be a good idea.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The VPN isn&#39;t working. </strong>If your browsing speed is sluggish or the VPN keeps dropping the connection, your VPN server might be having problems. Disconnecting and reconnecting, even in the same location, should switch you to a different server that may work better.</p></li><li><p><strong>The VPN is causing unintended browsing errors.</strong> If you’re using mapping software or just trying to do a location-based search, having your VPN active can cause more problems than it solves. </p></li><li><p><strong>Your internet connection is unstable.</strong> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">A VPN adds an extra step</a> to the process of getting online. If your phone is already struggling, the VPN might be an unnecessary complication.</p></li><li><p><strong>You&#39;re on a site that blocks all VPNs.</strong> Sites that work based on your location, including all streaming sites, may blanket-block VPNs so nothing messes with their location services. Good VPNs can get around these blocks, but even the best sometimes fail. In these cases, briefly turning off the VPN may be a good idea.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your battery is low. </strong>VPNs can put a strain on your phone&#39;s battery life. This varies with the quality of your VPN, but you may sometimes need to shut it off if your battery is in the red.</p></li></ul><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-off-icloud-private-relay"><strong>How to turn off iCloud Private Relay</strong></h2><p>iCloud Private Relay is not a VPN, but it&#39;s often confused for one. If you found this page because you want to turn it off, you&#39;re in luck — the steps are just as simple as turning off a VPN. Start by opening <strong>Settings</strong>, then tap your name. Scroll down and tap <strong>iCloud</strong>.</p><p>Private Relay will only be active if you&#39;re an iCloud+ subscriber. If you are, tap <strong>Private Relay</strong>, then choose whether to turn it off temporarily or indefinitely.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-turn-off-a-vpn-on-iphone-180000533.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s a dollar per month. This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21.</p> 
<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>

<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review-a-new-spin-on-a-reliable-formula-160009025.html"><ins>review</ins></a> of the first-generation Ultras, we gave them a score of 86 out of 100, noting their best-in-class active noise cancellation (ANC) and comfort. Bose improved its stock tuning for these headphones, which we could immediately tell sounded warmer and clearer. Bose has typically lagged behind the likes of Sony and Sennheiser in raw sound quality, but the first-generation QuietComfort Ultra was a big step toward catching up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Bose added &quot;Immersive Audio&quot; to this model, which is the company&#39;s take on spatial audio. The company claims this feature effectively puts you in the acoustic sweet spot of a set of stereo speakers. In our testing, we felt this didn&#39;t always make songs sound better, but it did make them louder and in some cases made certain details more noticeable.</p> 
<p>The Ultras offer up to 24 hours of battery life with ANC turned on and about 18 hours with both ANC and Immersive Audio enabled. In our testing, however, we were actually able to beat Bose&#39;s estimates for battery life.</p> 
<p>The second generation of these headphones are currently our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html"><ins>best noise-canceling headphones</ins></a>, but when this older model is heavily on sale, the differences between them are less dramatic. If you&#39;re in the market for a pair of great noise-canceling cans, consider checking these out.</p>

Once enabled, &quot;Personal Intelligence&quot; can pull context from across your Google ecosystem, including Gmail, Google Photos, Search and YouTube History, to gain specific insight that will shape its answers and recommendations. Personal Intelligence is available starting today in the US for Google AI Pro and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html"><ins>Ultra</ins></a> subscribers. The feature is opt-in only and is off by default.</p>

<p>Google says users will have the ability to control what apps Gemini pulls from and, in the future, which chats it uses Personal Intelligence for. The company says this new feature might still make some mistakes, such as “over-personalization” where it draws connections between unrelated things.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Google, Gemini will not train directly on the data it pulls for personalization like your photos and emails, but will instead train on your prompts and its responses. Users can also prompt Gemini to &quot;try again&quot; without personalization and will have the option to delete chat histories.</p>
<p>For now, Personal Intelligence works in the Gemini app across web, Android and iOS for personal Google accounts. Google says it’s coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-search-ai-mode-is-now-available-in-more-languages-and-regions-043540278.html"><ins>Search’s AI Mode</ins></a> soon, with plans to expand to more countries and the free tier down the line.</p>
<p>Google has been on a tear integrating Gemini into everything, including <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gmail-is-getting-a-gemini-ai-overhaul-130000422.html"><ins>Gmail</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tvs-new-gemini-features-range-from-useful-to-unnecessary-222900001.html"><ins>TVs</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-gemini-ai-comes-to-chrome-on-iphone-and-ipad-130003432.html"><ins>Chrome on mobile</ins></a>.

For instance, YouTube will suggest videos from the likes of Khan Academy, CrashCourse and TED-Ed to them more often. It said it developed these principles (and a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/creatingforteens.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">guide</a> for creators to make teen-friendly videos) with help from its youth advisory committee, the Center for Scholars and Storytellers at UCLA, the American Psychological Association, the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital and other organizations.</p><p>Moreover, an updated sign-up process for kid accounts will be available in the coming weeks. Kid accounts are tied to parental ones, and don&#39;t have their own associated email address or a password.&nbsp;YouTube says users will be able to switch between accounts in the mobile app with just a few taps. &quot;This makes it easier to ensure that everyone in the family is in the right viewing experience with the content settings and recommendations of age-appropriate content they actually want to watch,&quot; O&#39;Connor wrote.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-adds-more-parental-controls-including-a-way-to-block-teens-from-watching-shorts-151329673.html?src=rss]]></description>

The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re almost exactly halfway through January, but Nintendo has clearly taken a better-late-than-never approach to its 2025 year in review feature, which finally went <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2011157833308413966">live</a> this week for Switch and Switch 2 users. All you need to do is head <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://year-in-review.nintendo.com/">here</a> and sign into your Nintendo account to see your 2025 breakdown.</p>
<p>Like most annual gaming wrap-ups, Nintendo&#39;s shows how many games you played over the calendar year, as well as your total playtime. It also shows you your most-played titles for each month, your preferred genres by percentage, and if you scroll all the way to the bottom you can choose your favorite game of the year. You can also download a shareable image that shows off your taste, but there’s no way to directly share your results on social media through the website.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>2025 was a massive year for Nintendo, with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">Switch 2</a> launching in early June.

The company released a beta version of the update last week. Starting today, all NVIDIA app users with a GeForce RTX GPU will be able to upgrade to the full release of DLSS 4.5.</p><p>NVIDIA says DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution (to give its full name) delivers sharper visuals and improved temporal stability. The 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer reduces ghosting and improves anti-aliasing in more than 400 games and apps, the company claims. &quot;This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet, utilizing five times the compute power of the original transformer model, having been trained on a significantly expanded, high-fidelity dataset,&quot; NVIDIA added.</p><p>The company plans to bring an upgraded frame generation feature to DLSS 4.5 sometime this spring for those with GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. It says the Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature can generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally generated one, delivering up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4cfzFd9HzU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-rolls-out-dlss-45-to-all-rtx-gpus-140000322.html?src=rss]]></description>

To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a>, one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">Engadget&#39;s favorite budgeting apps</a>, for just $50 if you use code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout and you&#39;re a new subscriber. That&#39;s a 50 percent discount on the service&#39;s normal $100 price.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>
