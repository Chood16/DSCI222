                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone remembers the unique controllers that never quite made it. As third-party peripheral makers attempt to offer gamers something different to the likes of DualSense and Joy-Cons, they often have to go in a different direction. GameSir’s Swift Drive (apparently a working product name) is definitely that. And if you remember 1998’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogcon"><ins>JogCon</ins></a> for the PS1, there’s definitely some shared DNA.</p>
<p>It features a compact steering wheel at the center of an otherwise typical controller design. It’s also got force feedback, tech usually found in (full-size!) steering wheel controllers. GameSir says it has a “high precision” Hall Effect encoder built in for “ultra-accurate” steering.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/3db02270-eb5b-11f0-9fe7-e24c400fcfcb" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/3db02270-eb5b-11f0-9fe7-e24c400fcfcb" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="GameSir Swiftdrive hands-on at CES 2026" data-uuid="196ab6e4-d479-36f1-b4d4-fab7a3350235"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>

<p>You will be able to adjust the steering range from 30 to 1080 degrees, but you’d likely want to keep it high – it’s the entire point of this controller. GameSir has added Hall-effect sensors to its more typical joysticks and buttons, while each trigger has its own haptic motor to simulate wheel slip and braking. Several RGB lights across the top of the controller will even attempt to replicate your in-game RPMs, which is a cute touch.</p>
<div id="3718a9bbcc6a4ea390075861a98a2bcf"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCGWBtrjUIY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>On the show floor at CES, I drove a big rig in a demonstration area that was stripped down to wireframe ramps and curved surfaces. The force-feedback is powerful and it’s a surprisingly satisfying driving experience as I wheeled around, rotating the steering wheel with both thumbs. The steering wheel can also be customized with different plates. It felt like a miniaturized steering-wheel controller and would lock out when I oversteered or stopped. You may be concerned about battery life, but the controller should last 20-30 hours on a single charge.</p>
<p>A GameSir spokesperson said the controller is expected to go on sale later this year, but pricing has not yet been confirmed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-game-controller-has-a-force-feedback-steering-wheel-lodged-in-the-middle-034521141.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robot vacuum companies are once again out in full force at CES 2026, giving their devices a new set of intriguing — and sometimes unsettling — capabilities. This year, Chinese appliance maker Dreame is showing off a vacuum prototype with giant legs that can climb up and down an entire flight of stairs.</p><p>The concept, called the Cyber X, was previewed last year at IFA in Berlin. The vacuum sports a somewhat terrifying set of legs with rubber treads that allow it to autonomously navigate multi-story environments. While Dreame has previously shown off vacuums that can move up <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-x50-robot-vacuum-can-climb-stairs-200058312.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">smaller steps</a>, it says the Cyber X can climb stairs up to 25cm (9.8 inches) high and slopes up to 42 degrees. It can manage both straight and curved staircases, and can climb a flight of steps in 27 seconds, according to the company.</p><p>We got a chance to see the Cyber X and its stair-climbing abilities at Dreame’s CES booth, and the device was able to deftly crawl up and down a flight of stairs. The Cyber X didn’t use its “legs” to walk up the steps, though. Instead, it used the treads horizontally, moving a bit like a miniature, cleaning tank.</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/CrFGiQsa" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Interestingly, the actual vacuum is separate from the climbing apparatus. As you can see in the image below, the larger device with legs has an opening where the actual robot vacuum can dock inside and sit while the Cyber X climbs stairs. </p><p>That likely means the Cyber X isn’t able to clean the stairs themselves, though it does cleverly solve the problem of transporting the vacuum throughout multi-story environments. </p><p>In addition to its legs, the Cyber X’s vacuum also has a built-in water tank to support mopping abilities, and a laser-powered navigation system to help it maneuver up stairs and around other obstacles. It also has a braking system that allows it to stay stable on floors and stairs, even if the battery dies. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_cyber_x_and_base.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_cyber_x_and_base.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Dreame&#39;s Cyber X." data-uuid="8a324934-df10-4c2c-b2ab-0b05c9d1562d"><figcaption>Dreame&#39;s Cyber X.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>For now, Dreame says Cyber X is just a research prototype and hasn&#39;t indicated if it plans to make it, or a robo vac like it, more widely available at some point in the future.

The appropriately-named Lenovo AI Glasses Concept promises to transform &quot;how users interact with their surroundings and unifies their workflow.&quot;</p>
<p>They look like a standard pair of specs and not all that different from something like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>. A pair weighs just 45 grams and the battery lasts eight hours, which is just enough time to get through a standard workday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The glasses are wirelessly tethered to a smart device, which is what does most of the computational heavy lifting. They do include Lenovo and Motorola&#39;s proprietary AI platform called Qira, which delivers &quot;sub-millisecond live translation and intelligent image recognition.&quot; There&#39;s also something called the Catch Me Up feature, which is an AI-generated recap of various notifications from various devices.</p>
<p>The hardware allows for touch and voice control and includes teleprompter software. The concept glasses include speakers, as Lenovo is advertising music playback as a feature.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know when or if these smart glasses will ever hit store shelves. Lenovo tends to drop several intriguing concept designs <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-lenovos-tech-world-event-at-ces-2026-130004053.html">each year at CES</a> and not all of them make it to market.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/lenovo-just-revealed-a-concept-for-ai-powered-smartglasses-at-ces-010057822.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lenovo has brought a slew of updates to its Legion and LOQ line of gaming laptops for CES 2026. The refreshed laptops are all built around Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>
<p>The new Legion 7a is both thinner and lighter than the previous generation and is aimed at gamers, creators, and working professionals. Lenovo says the new 7a will be powered by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-ai-400-chips-are-a-big-boost-for-laptops-and-desktops-alike-033000635.html"><ins>AMD Ryzen AI 400 CPUs</ins></a> and RTX 50-series GPUs, delivering up to 125W of total system power.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Presumably this means buyers will choose from multiple CPU and GPU configurations, and Lenovo says the 7a will support up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 and up to an RTX 5060 GPU, but precise details on other configurations have not been made available.</p>
<p>The laptop sports a 16-inch OLED display and Lenovo says the laptop&#39;s &quot;AI-optimized&quot; performance is ready to handle complex coding, simulation, and 3D modeling projects. The 7a runs on Windows 11 Copilot+ and uses on-board software to dynamically tune power use and thermals depending on the workload the laptop is under. The Legion 7a will start at $2,000, with availability &quot;expected&quot; in April.</p>
<p>Lenovo is also refreshing the Legion 5 line with the Legion 5i powered by the new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html"><ins>Intel Core Ultra Series 3</ins></a> and Legion 5a with a choice of an AMD Ryzen AI 400 or Ryzen 200. Both will offer RTX 50-series GPUs, OLED displays and the same software-based tuning features as the 7a. Lenovo says the 5i can be figured up to an Intel Ultra 9 386H with an RTX 5060 GPU, and the 5a up to a Ryzen AI 9 465 with RTX 5060. Here again we don&#39;t yet have details on alternate configurations.</p>
<p>The Legion 5 laptops run on Windows 11 Copilot+, and Lenovo says they are ready for gaming, streaming, building presentations and video editing.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Motorola just announced its very first side-foldable smartphone, joining the ranks of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-tankiest-foldable-170051471.html">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. The Razr Fold boasts an impressive 6.6-inch external screen and an 8.1-inch flexible main display. The company hasn&#39;t provided dimensions, so we don&#39;t know how thick it is.</p>
<p>We do know, however, that it&#39;ll include support for the Moto Pen Ultra stylus. This is actually a fairly big deal, as Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/unpacked-2025-s-pen-shocker-galaxy-z-fold-7-loses-compatibility-with-stylus">dropped the feature for the Z Fold 7</a>. Modern foldables basically double as tablets, so a stylus is always appreciated.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a robust camera system here, with a 50MP Sony sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro, a 50MP telephoto, a 32MP external selfie lens and a 20MP internal camera. It also offers the ability to record in Dolby Vision.</p>
<p>The Razr Fold will be available in blue and white. We don&#39;t have any information regarding internal specs, pricing or availability. Motorola says that &quot;more specifications will be shared in the coming months.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that while this is the company&#39;s first side-folding camera, Motorola has always made top-folding phones. After all, that&#39;s what a flip phone is. The company continues to refine this basic idea with its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html">standard Razr line</a> of midrange top-folding smartphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-just-announced-a-foldable-phone-to-rival-samsung-and-google-at-ces-010015323.html?src=rss]]></description>

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition and ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Gen 11 Aura Edition come with a new design the company has dubbed “Space Frame.” </p><p>Lenovo calls Space Frame an “engineering breakthrough” and describes it as a design that restructures the interior of a laptop, so that components are placed on both sides of the motherboard. This structure improves the computer’s cooling and, hence, enables higher sustained performance. It comes with replaceable USB ports, battery, keyboard speakers and fans for easier repairs, and it also gives Lenovo enough room to equip laptops with a larger haptic touchpad.</p><p>In addition to having the Space Frame design, both ThinkPad X1 Carbon and X1 2-in-1 Aura Editions are Microsoft Copilot+ PCs powered by the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Intel Core Ultra X7 Series 3 processors,</a> which also debuted at CES. The processors ship with 12Xe graphic cores and integrated NPUs for AI acceleration. Both models also introduce  a new 10MP camera with a 110-degree-wide field of view that features advanced distortion correction. As for the ThinkPad X1 2-in-1, it ships with a new magnetically docked pen that was designed to be ergonomic. </p><p>The company has announced the ThinkPad X9 15p Aura Edition at the event, as well. It’s a follow-up to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">last year’s X9</a> with an all-aluminum chassis, making it an alternative to Apple’s MacBooks. This model comes with a 15.3-inch 2.8K OLED display and ThinkPad’s largest haptic touchpad, and it’s powered by the new Intel Core Ultra X9 Series 3 processors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-14th-gen-thinkpad-x1-carbon-comes-with-a-new-space-frame-design-010000262.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you saw <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-review-the-utility-pc-gaming-handheld-120000533.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lenovo&#39;s Legion Go 2 launch</a> last year and thought, &quot;I&#39;ll wait for the SteamOS version,&quot; well, you&#39;ll have to wait a little longer. But at least now it&#39;s official. At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company revealed the Legion Go 2, Powered by SteamOS. The Valve-friendly variant of the gaming handheld arrives in June, starting at a pricey $1,199.</p><p>There aren&#39;t any surprises here. It&#39;s the same Lenovo Legion Go 2 hardware, with SteamOS replacing the sometimes-awkward Windows. In many ways, you could view the SteamOS Legion Go 2 as a more powerful and versatile (and expensive!) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam Deck</a>. One notable exception is the optimizations game developers often make for Valve&#39;s handheld. (Ditto for &quot;Steam Deck Verified&quot; badges on store listings to learn quickly how playable games are.)</p><p>So, all the specs from the Windows version carry over. That includes a spacious 8.8-inch OLED display at 1,920 x 1,200 and with a 144Hz VRR. You still have two tiers to choose from: Ryzen Z2 / 16GB  / 1TB or Ryzen Z2 Extreme / 32GB / 2TB. The device has a microSD slot, kickstand, detachable controllers and a 74Wh battery. At 2.2 lbs, it&#39;s a bulky affair, so you&#39;ll want to look elsewhere if a light, compact handheld is your priority.</p><p>Lenovo says the Legion Go 2, Powered by SteamOS is expected in June. It will start at $1,199 for the entry-level variant. (Lenovo hasn&#39;t yet announced pricing for the Z2 Extreme tier.)

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A couple years ago Lenovo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-auto-twist-concept-laptop-has-a-lid-that-can-swivel-and-bow-down-at-your-command-150022971.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">showed off a concept laptop stand</a> that used cameras and AI to follow you around. But now at CES 2026, the company has taken that idea and turned it into a full-fledged system that it’s actually going to sell.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubbed the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist, instead of a laptop stand, Lenovo created a standalone notebook with the same functionality, plus a little more. The impressive thing is that despite having a built-in motor that lets its display follow you around, the laptop’s design doesn&#39;t look all that outlandish. And after playing around with it a bit, I discovered a handful of other tricks it can do.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2LFxh30Xo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Instead of using your fingers to open the lid like a luddite, all you have to do is knock a couple times and then the laptop’s display will pop up by itself. From there, you’re greeted with a surprisingly good-looking 14-inch 2.8K OLED display and a traditional keyboard that won’t upset longtime ThinkBook or ThinkPad aficionados. You also get solid specs including support for Intel’s new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, up to 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage and a decently large 75Whr battery. The laptop also sports a strong selection of ports including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, a full-size HDMI jack and Wi-Fi 7. And all of this comes in a chassis that weighs 3.1 pounds, which is very reasonable for a 14-inch machine.&nbsp;</p><p>As for its auto-twisting abilities, the main use case is during presentation and video calls, where the laptop can use its motor, 10-MP webcam and AI to track your face as you move around so you stay neatly in frame. Compared to the concept I saw before, the laptop pivots and rotates its display more smoothly (though it’s still a bit jerky) and if you want, you can even make it dance to music. Alternatively, the laptop can analyze your posture to position its screen in the optimal position to prevent slouching or automatically transform between laptop, tablet and presentation modes. While this is a really minor inclusion, my favorite thing about the Auto Twist is that when you turn the system off, the laptop will automatically close its own lid, as if it was tucking itself into bed.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6aa8e884-d5ee-41d7-bfc3-315af0af150f"/><p>The other goal of this laptop is that Lenovo is touting it as a vertical AI solution for small businesses. Naturally this means that the system supports Microsoft’s Copilot+ features, though we also saw a demo of Lenovo’s own AI companion. Not only can you talk to it, ask it questions or use it to translate other languages like a regular digital assistant, the company created a friendly face that reacts to your queries and comments.&nbsp;</p><p>The one odd inclusion, which probably won’t make it to retail units, was an AI feature designed to help you understand hidden meanings or subtext in other languages. However, in my experience (as seen in the video above), this turned into a weird excuse to get negged by AI or at the very least make yourself more paranoid about what your friends or coworkers are saying about you.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/auto-twist-lid-twisted.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/auto-twist-lid-twisted.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="My favorite thing about the Auto Twist is that if you shut it down, it will automatically close its own lid.

But if you have happy feet during work meetings or like to express yourself through movement, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist might be the business notebook you need. Plus, considering it features relatively novel tech, its starting price of $1,649 is surprisingly approachable. You’ll just have to wait until it goes on sale sometime in June.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-7-auto-twist-wont-let-you-out-of-it-sight-010000913.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Lenovo has experimented more with laptops featuring rollable displays than pretty much any other PC maker and at CES 2026 it’s keeping that trend going with the XD Rollable Concept.</p><p>Equipped with a 180-degree Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover, the XD Rollable concept features a very futuristic design. However, underneath, it has the same basic engineering as last year’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6.</a> That means with the touch of a button, its 13.3-inch flexible OLED display can expand to 16 inches, which gives you around 50 percent extra screen space in just a few seconds. The main difference with Lenovo’s latest concept is that instead of hiding the unused section of its rollable display underneath its keyboard, the XD’s panel wraps up and over its lid to create a “world-facing” display around back. This allows people sitting on the other side of the laptop to see content, with the laptop capable of mirroring elements from its main display or using that space as a small secondary monitor.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kswd5I_trbc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Now I will admit that after seeing the XD Rollable in person, its design does feel a bit gimmicky. Even though Lenovo’s space-themed animation that appears when the laptop’s display extends is pretty slick, I’m not sure how helpful that world-facing display really is. In normal use, you can’t even see it because it’s on the other side of the lid and while I suppose you could utilize that area for meetings or presentations, I think most people would be much better off simply connecting the notebook to a dedicated secondary monitor or projector.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="36d6ee06-e8a6-4dc9-9a89-3befeba89c7e"/><p>That said, I do like that contrary to the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, by exposing the unused part of the XD Rollable’s display when it’s not extended, you get a little bit of extra value out of it. At the very least, it beats stashing the rest of the panel underneath the keyboard where it won’t be seen at all. On top of that, I like the look of having no bezel along the top of the display and you can even use touch controls on the edge of the display to control widgets or expand its flexible screen. Interestingly, the coolest part about the XD Rollable might not even be its screen, but the motors and rails that Lenovo uses to extend its display, which are easily seen beneath its glass design.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the XD Rollable is very down to earth with it featuring a comfy keyboard and a decent-sized touchpad. The main downsides are that its glass lid makes the concept a bit heavier than a more traditional 13-inch notebook and you only get two USB-C ports. But considering that Lenovo isn’t planning to put this thing into production, that lack of connectivity or info regarding its specs shouldn’t come as a big surprise.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html?src=rss]]></description>

At CES 2026, the company is announcing a sequel to its tracker, the Moto Tag 2, a stylus for its new folding phone, the Moto Pen Ultra and a more premium smartwatch called the Moto Watch.</p><p>The Moto Watch has a 47mm round face with a stainless steel crown and an aluminum frame. The smartwatch comes with a PANTONE &quot;Volcanic Ash&quot; silicone band, but is designed to support third-party 22mm bands, too, which greatly expands its customization options. Motorola says the watch can get up to 13 days of battery life normally or seven days with its always-on display enabled, and also features a built-in speaker and microphone for hands-free controls and audio notifications. The Moto Watch is meant to be fairly durable, as well, with Gorilla Glass 3 front glass and IP68 water and dust resistance.</p><p>The actual fitness features of the watch are powered by Motorola&#39;s new partner Polar, a company with its own line of fitness trackers and smartwatches. The Moto Watch lets users log their calorie consumption throughout the day, track their workouts and activity levels (with a daily Activity Goal and Activity Score) and monitor their sleep. The watch also has built-in dual-frequency GPS for tracking runs, bike rides and hikes.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Motorola-Moto-Pen-Ultra.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Motorola-Moto-Pen-Ultra.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A hand holding a Moto Pen Ultra writing on a Razr Fold." data-uuid="6ca15c61-76c8-4b0c-b2a4-db8c356cae1c"/><figcaption>A hand holding a Moto Pen Ultra writing on a Razr Fold.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Motorola</div></figure><p>While Samsung dropped S Pen stylus support on its latest version of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (one of many ways the company got the foldable so thin), Motorola is embracing styluses on its new Razr Fold.

The Moto Tag 2 is IP68-rated and now gets over 500 days of battery life in comparison to the original Tag&#39;s year-long battery. As before, the Bluetooth tracker connects to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-improving-scam-detection-and-its-find-feature-on-android-170037324.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Google&#39;s Find Hub</a> network and Motorola says the tracker&#39;s ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna and support for Bluetooth Channel Sounding can help users determine the exact distance they are from their tracked object. You can also press the button on the Moto Tag 2 to ring your phone if it&#39;s missing, or customize the Tag to act as a camera shutter button.</p><p>Motorola hasn&#39;t shared pricing details for any of its new Moto Things accessories, though it has provided a release date for at least one. The Moto Watch will be available on January 22 from the company&#39;s website. The Moto Tag 2 and Moto Pen Ultra, meanwhile, will both be available in North America &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-expands-its-moto-things-lineup-with-a-new-bluetooth-tracker-stylus-and-smartwatch-010000669.html?src=rss]]></description>

On Tuesday evening, the company announced Qira, a cross-device AI for both its own computers and Motorola smartphones. Set to arrive later this quarter, it will live at the system level of Lenovo devices. Users won&#39;t need to open or switch to the assistant. Instead, &quot;it&#39;s always present,&quot; says Lenovo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you can ignore Qira, and it will stay quiet if you don&#39;t need the software to do anything for you. Occasionally, Lenovo says Qira will surface proactive suggestions, and for frequent users, the company promises a machine learning system that will develop a &quot;living model&quot; of your world, &quot;understanding context, continuity and personal patterns of over time.&quot; In practice, that means Qira can write emails for you, transcribe and translate meetings and provide summaries of things you might have missed. You know, all the usual stuff every company is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-essential-spaces-ai-powered-app-done-right-163042976.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">offering with their on-device assistants</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From a privacy standpoint, Lenovo says Qira employs a hybrid architecture that &quot;prioritizes&quot; on-device processing, and won&#39;t collect customer data without the user&#39;s permission.&nbsp;&quot;Every aspect of the Lenovo Qira experience is designed to be secure, ethical, and accountable.&quot; I asked Lenovo how Qira would interact with Copilot and Gemini on the company&#39;s PCs and Motorola smartphones, and if the new assistant would add to the processing load on those devices, but the company has yet to respond to my email. I&#39;ll update this article when I hear back.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, creating a dedicated AI assistant for the company&#39;s devices is something I&#39;m sure Lenovo executives agreed was a good idea, but when many people aren&#39;t even using Copilot, it feels like a misread of what Lenovo users want. In April, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/microsofts-big-ai-hire-cant-match" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reporting from <em>Newcomer</em></a><em> </em>suggested Copilot had flatlined at around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">20 million weekly users</a> in 2024.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lenovo might have the most concept devices of any company at CES 2026, but the wildest and most interesting one is almost certainly the Legion Pro Rollable which features a 16-inch flexible display that can expand to not one but two different sizes.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the Legion Pro Rollable, Lenovo started out with a standard <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-ces-2025-the-10th-gen-legion-pro-7i-gaming-laptop-supports-up-to-rtx-5090-graphics-160004703.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Legion Pro 7i</a> and kept the bottom half including all of its ports and support for an RTX 5090 GPU. But then the company went a bit crazy: Instead of replacing the notebook’s original 16-inch OLED screen with a rollable variant that extends upwards like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Thinkbook Plus Gen 6</a> from 2025, Lenovo opted for one that expands outwards to either 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches This means instead of being restricted to a standard 16:10 aspect ratio, you also have the choice of 21:9 or an ultra-wide 24:9 with just the touch of a button. Or more like two buttons because to widen or shrink its display, you need to press FN plus one of its arrow keys.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept goes wide and wiiiider. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/R5fJ0vU3NX">pic.twitter.com/R5fJ0vU3NX</a></p>— Sam Rutherford (@samrutherford) <a href="https://twitter.com/samrutherford/status/2008706297118761202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>Admittedly that feels a bit clunky considering some of Lenovo’s other laptops with expandable displays have a dedicated button. But this is a concept device after all, which was immediately obvious when I got a chance to see this up close. The bottom of the laptop feels solid, as you’d probably expect because not much has changed there. However, the top of the laptop didn’t feel super sturdy, probably due to the display’s hinge not being able to fully support a heavier lid and the notebook’s bulkier rollable display.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="edb91ca6-76a5-410a-be3b-1728f1d796a5"/><p>I also noticed that there were some faint lines left by the internal motors that allow the rollable display to do its thing and a bit of waviness from the panel due to it not being super taut. That said, from the side, I was impressed that even for a prototype, Lenovo did a halfway decent job of eliminating any huge panel gaps or empty spaces where the lid expands. The biggest bummer is that even though Lenovo had a handful of demo units on on site, there weren’t any games installed so I wasn’t able see the Legion Pro Rollable’s tech function in full glory.&nbsp;</p><p>But if we’re being honest, none of that really matters on a gadget that’s meant to be a showcase and testbed for next-gen tech. The idea of a gaming laptop with a screen that can go from normal to ultra-wide at the touch of a button (or buttons) is super cool, especially if you play titles like flight sims, racing games or big open-world adventures that can take advantage of an extra wide screen. And out of all of the concepts I’ve seen at CES 2026, this one is at the top of the list of stuff that I hope eventually gets turned into a proper retail product.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year at CES, Dreame showed off a robot vacuum prototype with a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">mechanical arm</a>. But while we were able to see the arm extend and retract, we didn’t see the device, which was described as a prototype at the time, actually grab anything, which was a bit disappointing.</p><p>This year, though, the company has made its arm-enabled vacuum a reality with the Cyber 10 Ultra. Dreame previewed it recently at IFA in Berlin, but has now confirmed it will be on sale later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The vacuum has an extendable arm that looks pretty similar to the prototype version we saw last year. It extends from the top of the vacuum and has a claw-like device at the end for scooping up objects. According to Dreame, it can pick up items that weigh up to 500 grams (about 1 pound) so it should be able to grab a wider variety of stuff than the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/roborocks-new-flagship-robot-vacuum-has-an-arm-that-can-grab-small-objects-170020390.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Roborock vac</a> we saw last year, which had a 300-gram weight limit for its arm.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="0" height="0" src="" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>The arm can also do more than pick up stuff from the floor. It supports its own cleaning accessories, and can grab vacuum nozzles and brush attachments from its base station. This allows the arm to act as an extension of the vacuum itself so it can be used similarly to how you might use hose attachments to reach hard-to-get areas with a traditional vacuum.&nbsp;</p><p>We were able to see a brief demo of the Cyber 10 arm in action on the CES show floor.  It was able to pick up balls and place them in a basket. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see it lift any heavier object or grab its cleaning attachments, but we were able to get a good look at the base station and the small cubbies where they will be stored.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_base_station.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_base_station.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="The base station that holds the attachments for the vacuum&#39;s arm." data-uuid="e9ecf531-8452-40b7-82fc-fe838692138e"><figcaption>The base station that holds the attachments for the vacuum&#39;s arm.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>And, like Dreame&#39;s other robot vacuums, the Cyber 10 Ultra also has mopping abilities and can climb up small steps up to 6cm (about 2.4 inches). That&#39;s not quite as impressive as the tank-like stair-climbing Cyber X prototype it also brought to CES, but should help the Cyber 10 reach a few extra places in the house.&nbsp;</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t announced an exact release date, but says it&#39;s targeting August of this year and currently expects the Cyber 10 Ultra to cost around €1799 (about $2,100).</p><p><strong>Update, January 6, 2026, 4:17PM PT:</strong> This story was updated with new photos, a video and information about the Cyber 10 Ultra.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-robot-vacuum-with-an-arm-is-back-at-ces-2026-and-it-can-do-more-than-pick-up-shoes-210000020.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the original, and<em> </em>best <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-11-total-recall-mind-bending-blu-ray-july-31st.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Total Recall,</em></a><em> </em>there’s a scene where Rekall’s receptionist uses a digital pen to change the color of her nail polish. It’s only taken 35 years, but now a company has turned up to CES 2026 with a version that actually works outside a pricey sci-fi movie. iPolish is a company which makes press-on acrylic nails that, when you apply an electric charge, changes color.</p><p>In order to enjoy kaleidoscopic nails, you’ll need to charge the wand, which then connects to your phone. Once you’ve selected your color of choice, you just put the tip of the nail into the wand, and it’ll pass a short charge into the nail to change it. Sadly, the company wouldn’t shed too much light on the process it uses to run the nails but, from my guess, it’s some sort of electrochemical shenanigans going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;All in all, it took around five seconds to change the color of a single nail, so it’s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"/><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>iPolish says that each nail can display 400 colors, and can be changed as many times as the user would like. So, if you’re coordinating your nails with your outfits, you’re not bound to a single color palette in the weeks between salon visits. They’re also surprisingly affordable, with the starter set <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ipolish.fashion/collections/starter-kits" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">costing $95</a> which contains two sets of nails, one in Ballerina cut, one in Squoval. The Ballerinas are relatively short, while the Sqovals are longer.&nbsp; It’s worth noting that you can’t shape the nails as you’ll break the hardware, so if you don’t like those shapes, you can’t use ‘em.</p><p>When it comes time to replace your nails when one breaks or you lose it in some nailbed mishap, you’ll be able to pick up spares for $6.50. Given the theoretical cost of getting your nails re-done on a weekly basis, being able to change color on a whim seems like a bargain. Of course, we won’t be able to speak to iPolish’s quality and reliability until they start shipping, which is presently expected to begin in June 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html?src=rss]]></description>

</div><p>The experience is part of Garmin&#39;s &quot;Unified Cabin&quot; concept, which explores a bunch of AI-centric in-car experiences. The demo I tried was fairly limited: while wearing a neural band, I was able to navigate two apps on a touchscreen display in Garmin&#39;s cockpit setup. In one, I used pinch and swipe gestures to manipulate an onscreen model of a car, much like how I would use the band to zoom in and out of an image while wearing the display glasses. The second demo, somewhat bizarrely, was a game of 2048. I used the same swipe gestures to move the tiles around.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither of those are the kinds of experiences you immediately think of when you imagine &quot;in-car entertainment,&quot; but Garmin, which works with a number of major car brands on infotainment systems, seems to be thinking about some more practical use cases too. The company told me that it will explore using the neural band to control vehicle functions like rolling down windows or unlocking doors.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Meta also announced a research collaboration with the University of Utah that will explore how its EMG tech can be used to help people who have ALS, muscular dystrophy and other conditions that affect the use of their hands.</p><p>Researchers will work with Meta to test gestures that could enable people to control smart speakers, blinds, thermostats, locks and other household devices using the neural band.&nbsp; &quot;Meta Neural Band is sensitive enough to detect subtle muscle activity in the wrist — even for people who can’t move their hands,&quot; the company explains in a blog post. Researchers will also look at using the band for mobility use cases, like the University of Utah&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tetraski.us/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">TetraSki</a> program, which currently uses a joystick or mouth-based controller to help participants ski. </p><p>Update, Tuesday, January 6, 2026, 3:40PM PT: Added a video from garmin’s demo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-emg-wristband-is-moving-beyond-its-ar-glasses-120000503.html?src=rss]]></description>

The 1996 game from the legendary id Software has also been designated Handheld Optimized for the Xbox ROG Ally devices.

And don&#39;t forget that Valve&#39;s anticipated Steam Machine is due out some time early this year, so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to have those verification checkmarks start to carry more weight in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/quake-is-now-steam-deck-verified-223009852.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been using the same smartphone controller on my iPhone for years. That’s partly because most options are so similar. Announced at CES 2026, the X5 Alteron couldn’t be more different. It’s a collaboration between GameSir (which loves unusual peripheral <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-tarantula-pro"><ins>dalliances</ins></a>) and Hyperkin (retro-leaning <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyperkin-xenon-controller-announced-191629821.html"><ins>controller maker</ins></a>).</p>
<p>The X5 Alteron is apparently the world&#39;s first fully modular mobile games controller. While the headline feature might be the stick/d-pad/button modules, the X5 Alteron has a very accommodating vice grip that works with devices from iPhone and Android phones through to the Switch series and even iPads. There’s even Bluetooth if you want to use it with a PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the showfloor, Gamesir had a non-working prototype model with swappable modules, able to replicate most of your favorite layouts, including asymmetric analogue sticks, a yellow stick that’s aspiring to be a Gamecube controller and even a six-button array for those wanting to scratch that Sega Saturn itch. And if you want symmetrical sticks, you maniac, you can have that too. Rumble motors will also be built into the controller.</p>
<core-slideshow data-slideshowid="26e84b0a-6b31-45e1-8932-b9344f26b639"/>
<p>The modules lie flush when magnetically attached to the controller, although on the early prototype, they were difficult to remove. It’s pretty much fully customizable: there will be adjustable stick heights and hot-swappable buttons. Hyperkin and Gamesir are promising GameCube and N64 modules, and even a trackpad module for FPS games.</p>
<p>There’s contemporary technology too. The X5 Alteron will have capacitive sticks, not Hall-Effect ones. This should offer much more precision: the technology remains pretty rare in controllers. There are Hall-Effect analog triggers on the rear of the controller. It’s early days, with no release date or pricing set yet, but I&#39;m intrigued — and I suspect many mobile gamers are too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyperkin-and-gamesir-x5-alteron-modular-game-controller-ces-2026-221853624.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How far has Intel&#39;s embedded Arc&nbsp;graphics come over the years? Enough to let me play <em>Battlefield </em>6 at up to 190 fps in 1080p, with the graphics settings set to high, all on an unassuming Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5. There was no need for dedicated graphics, just the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Intel Core Ultra X9 388H&#39;s</a> built-in Arc B390 GPU. </p><p>There&#39;s a catch, of course: Intel&#39;s XeSS3 AI upscaling and 4X frame generation is the big reason why I was able to see such high fps figures. I was playing <em>Battlefield 6 </em>on a controller, with the Lenovo laptop connected to a TV, and I was surprised by how smooth the gameplay felt. There wasn&#39;t any sense of lag like I&#39;ve seen in earlier frame-gen implementations, though any lag would probably be more noticeable if I was playing with a high DPI gaming mouse. </p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/vU1uTQIR" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Environmental details, shadows, lighting and particle effects also looked flawless. If I was sitting on a couch, I’d think the game was being powered by a console or a budget gaming PC. I didn’t get a chance to push the resolution up to 1440p, but it’d be interesting to see if it could maintain at least 100 fps in that mode. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-3.jpg" style="height:1095px;width:2000px;" alt="Intel Core Ultra 3 gaming on a Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5." data-uuid="4a924e24-ce61-4a46-8e36-9c465245dc5d"><figcaption>Playing &quot;Battlefield 6&quot; with a Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5, powered by Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 3 chip.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Not all of Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 3 chips will achieve such lofty gaming heights, unfortunately. Only the X7 and X9 chips include 12 Xe GPU cores and Arc B390 graphics. The rest of the Core Ultra 3 family has the typical four Xe cores and basic Intel graphics. </p><p>Intel claims the B390 is around 80 percent faster than the Radeon 890M, which is built into the Ryzen HX370. Additionally, the company says the new GPU is 76 percent faster than its Arc 140T, and overall it should offer similar performance to the mobile RTX 4050 GPU.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-2.jpg" style="height:1236px;width:2000px;" alt="A Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5." data-uuid="1a614df4-c8a3-4a7e-bdd5-0616f3dfc66d"><figcaption>A Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The battery lasts for 30 hours when you include return trips to the charging case, at around eight hours a pop. They offer multipoint Bluetooth that switches between audio sources with just a single button press. There&#39;s an app for keeping an eye on battery levels and ANC levels.</p> 
<p>The primary downside when these were first released was the high price tag, which has been alleviated by this sale. Beyond that, there&#39;s really just one nitpick. Smaller earbuds translate to a smaller touch panel, which requires precision to operate.</p>

<p>Cosori says the air fryer is meant to address a pain point in the market regarding consumer concern over heating food in plastic air fryers. The company&#39;s answer to this is a 6.5-quart stainless steel fryer with a ceramic, nonstick coating on all surfaces that come in contact with food. Iconic has a brushed metal finish that Cosori says is corrosion resistant.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The controls and display for the fryer are seated under tempered glass atop the motor. From there, users can select from six different cooking functions consisting of air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate, proof and reheat. The fryer can run as cool as 90 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as 450.</p>
<p>Users can connect Iconic with the VeSync app, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Vesync;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d3f51408-1487-4ad5-a82e-1d819da83ad9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=89064382-8f58-4b86-8df2-ea297bfd9563&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vesync&amp;linkText=parent+company%27s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLnZlc3luYy5jb20vc3BlY2lhbC10b3BpYy8zNTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg5MDY0MzgyLThmNTgtNGI4Ni04ZGYyLWVhMjk3YmZkOTU2MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy52ZXN5bmMuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtdG9waWMvMzUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVuR2tybeZyoxvFbnuGoNv_2KUKSindU7dSQQCHLSQ2P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.vesync.com%2Fspecial-topic%2F350" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.vesync.com/special-topic/350"><ins>parent company&#39;s</ins></a> app for bluetooth-enabled devices across its brand portfolio.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IO Interactive just revealed minimum and recommended specs for the PC build of <em>007 First Light</em>. The company recommends 32GB of RAM and 12GB of VRAM. In a normal world, this wouldn&#39;t be news, as modern NVIDIA GPUs certainly have more than enough VRAM. However, we live in a world where <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html"><ins>AI companies gobble up lots of memory</ins></a><ins>.</ins></p>
<p>This has caused newer cards to tick up in price, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amd-and-nvidia-will-reportedly-raise-gpu-prices-significantly-in-2026"><ins>with more hikes to come</ins></a>. Older cards like the RTX 3070 just won&#39;t cut it, as that one ships with 8GB of VRAM. Standard RAM is also getting much more expensive, putting that 32GB out of reach for many gamers. In other words, playing the James Bond sim at max settings will likely cost a pretty Moneypenny.</p>

<p>IO also recommends an Intel Core i5 13500 or an AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, along with 80GB of storage space. Rumors have been swirling that NVIDIA is set to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-reportedly-bringing-back-2021s-rtx-3060-gpu-because-ai-is-eating-all-of-the-newer-cards-194241706.html"><ins>relaunch the RTX 3060</ins></a> from 2021 to help offset increased demand caused by the hungry hippo that is AI. That one does ship with enough VRAM to run the game at recommended settings.</p>
<p>However, mostly everyone will be able to play the game at minimum settings. It requires just an NVIDIA GTX 1660 or AMD RX 5700 and an Intel Core i5 9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500. Players must have 16GB of traditional RAM and 8GB of VRAM.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that both the recommended and minimum specs are for running the game in 1080p. The company hasn&#39;t announced anything for 4K settings, so it must be pretty bad on the VRAM front.</p>

<p>IO has also revealed a partnership with NVIDIA on the game. <em>007 First Light</em> will include DLSS 3 with Multi Frame Generation for &quot;an even deeper sense of immersion and improved performance.&quot;</p>
<p><em>007 First Light</em> is a nifty-looking action title that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html"><ins>chronicles the early years</ins></a> of everyone&#39;s favorite lothario spy.

That means it can comfortably fit with room to spare in a media PC enclosure like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/ridge/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Fractal Ridge</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Technically, NVIDIA&#39;s reference designs for the 5070 and 5080 are also dual-slot solutions, but most of the company&#39;s manufacturing partners produce two-and-half or three slot variants of those cards. And with no Founders Edition version of the 5070 Ti available from NVIDIA, PNY&#39;s new take on that GPU will likely find a dedicated fanbase among PC enthusiasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PNY says the new cards will arrive in February, with the company planning to offer both standard and overclocked versions of all three models. However, PNY isn&#39;t sharing pricing details just yet. That probably has to do with the state of the entire PC industry right now.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft announced the first batch of incoming Game Pass titles for 2026. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> headline the first wave of the January lineup.</p><p>If you (perhaps wisely) held off on spending $70 on Ubisoft&#39;s first stab at a Star Wars game, here&#39;s your chance to try it for less. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> sets you loose in an open world as the young thief Kay Vess. The third-person action title includes melee, shooting and stealth. There’s even some speeder chases and space dogfights to scratch your (boilerplate) Star Wars itch. Does it do anything novel or innovative to justify its full price? Not really. But it can still be a good time for fans of the saga.</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> arrives on Game Pass on January 13 (cloud, PC, and current-gen Xbox consoles). It will only be available for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>If you&#39;re less into Wookies and more about <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-mocap-interview-halloween-2021-163032866.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">10-foot-tall vampire ladies</a>, there&#39;s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. Capcom&#39;s 2021 title is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-horror-games-120029388.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">&quot;a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game,&quot;</a> as Engadget&#39;s Jessica Conditt put it. In addition to the iconic Countess Alcina Dimitrescu, you&#39;ll encounter werewolves, sea creatures and the requisite creepy dolls. The franchise&#39;s eighth mainline game is something of a departure for the series, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of familiar horror, puzzles and action.</p><p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> lands on Game Pass on January 20 (cloud, console, PC). It will be available for the Ultimate, Premium and PC tiers.</p><p>There&#39;s plenty of other fare arriving this month. <em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</em> and the twin-stick shooter <em>Brews &amp; Bastards</em> arrive today. The first-person survival action game <em>Atomfall</em> and the online soccer game <em>Rematch</em> land on January 7. Finally, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> 2D pixel remake arrives on January 8.</p><p>You can check out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Microsoft&#39;s blog post</a> for more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/resident-evil-village-and-star-wars-outlaws-join-januarys-game-pass-additions-182500938.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, we went hands-on at CES with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-sound-suite-hands-on-at-ces-2026-home-theater-powered-by-dolby-atmos-flexconnect-192709499.html"><ins>LG&#39;s new Sound Suite</ins></a> speakers featuring <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html"><ins>Dolby Atmos FlexConnect</ins></a> and now we have pricing for the entire lineup. The modular home audio system consists of four speakers that include a soundbar, surround speakers and a subwoofer.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the group is the H7 soundbar, which will retail for $1,000. The soundbar uses FlexConnect to optimize sound based on the layout of a room and its location therein. This is intended to solve for when a speaker can&#39;t be perfectly placed to deliver optimal sound, especially spatial audio.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The H7 also has a feature LG is calling Sound Follow that tracks the location of a user&#39;s phone throughout a room and adapts the audio to their location. The idea is that if you move from one side of the couch to the other, or to a chair in a totally different part of the room, you&#39;ll still receive the best possible sound.</p>
<p>The M7 and M5 surround speakers will sell for $400 and $250 respectively. These serve as satellite speakers to the H7 and can be placed around a room in pairs or used on their own. The W7 subwoofer carries a price tag of $600.</p>
<p>The entire suite is available for pre-order on LG&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LG Electronics;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1d615601-adcc-4281-a201-ab5efe07476c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;linkText=US+site&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvc291bmQtc3VpdGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFkNjE1NjAxLWFkY2MtNDI4MS1hMjAxLWFiNWVmZTA3NDc2YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3VzL3NvdW5kLXN1aXRlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAduVyJ15itMjM-eugXpka59-_VWwzESWW59HnjSuo1om&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fsound-suite" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.lg.com/us/sound-suite"><ins>US site</ins></a> now. The site lists several packages like the &quot;Immersive Quad Suite 7&quot; that include the H7 soundbar and four M7 speakers. Sadly, there do not seem to be discounts for purchasing these speakers as a bundle.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-has-released-pricing-for-its-new-sound-suite-speaker-lineup-181053832.html?src=rss]]></description>

The new accessories include improved visual interfaces, faster Qi2 wireless charging and “upgraded ecosystems” that support the latest iPhones. Some of the latest devices are even available to buy right now.</p>
<p>First up is the Anker Nano Charger with smart display, which features a tiny screen, 180-degree foldable prongs and provides up to 45W of power. The plug can identify the exact iPhone model connected and then deliver the right amount of power for your phone. Anker says the Nano uses three-stage power delivery and a "Care Mode" that the company claims keeps batteries cooler than some competing 45W chargers. It arrives in late January 2026 and will retail for $40.</p>
<p>For fans of wireless charging stations, the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station offers a 3-in-1 solution for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. It uses a "AirCool" system for "faster, safer performance" and offers up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. The design is also foldable for compact travel. It's set for release in Q1 2026 and will retail for $150.</p>
<p>The company debuted a clamp-on 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip with 70W of output and built-in surge protection. It sports two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and six AC outlets. The Nano Power Strip is getting a late January release, and it will sell for $70.</p>
<p>Anker also unveiled a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station. This serves as an all-in-one hub with support for up to three displays (with 4K resolution supported on a single display), up to 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between connected devices. It also features a removable 6-in-1 hub with SD and microSD card readers, a USB-A port and a 5 Gbps USB-C port. The Nano Docking Station is available now and retails for $150.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese micromobility company Navee has some wild new stuff at CES 2026. The lineup is headlined by the UT5 Ultra X, a dual-motor e-scooter with an advertised top speed of 43 mph. And who among us isn&#39;t in the market for an auto-following golf cart and a seaplane?</p><p>The flagship UT5 Ultra X is a sleek-looking e-scooter with a pair of 2,400W motors. Navee says it can reach a top speed of 43 mph and has a max range of 87 miles. (However, in the world of e-scooters, it&#39;s safe to expect the real-world range to be around half of what manufacturers promise.) It has a front and rear hydraulic suspension and front and rear hydraulic disc brakes. Navee claims it can accelerate from 0 to 12 mph in 1.98 seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_scooter.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_scooter.jpg" style="height:737px;width:1020px;" alt="Rendering of a helmeted person riding the UT5 Ultra X e-scooter on a racetrack." data-uuid="d859b3cb-4211-46c0-b6c7-f4d9affb665c"><figcaption>Navee UT5 Ultra X</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Navee</div></figure><p>If you want something that can hold its own on rougher terrain, there&#39;s the NT5 Ultra X. A pair of 1,200W motors helps this e-scooter reach a top speed of 40 mph and an advertised range of 56 miles. It has dual-disc brakes and an electronic anti-lock braking system. To help manage the bumps, it has two suspension types: a front telescopic suspension and a rear spring one. Navee claims its steel frame supports up to 330 lbs.</p><p>Then there&#39;s the Eagle F1X, which could put golf caddies out of work. This electronic cart can carry your clubs (up to 44 lbs). It has a &quot;smart auto-follow&quot; feature that uses a combination of AI and ultra-wideband. It also responds to voice and gesture controls. The 33-lb. cart uses a pair of 250W motors, and Navee claims it can handle 36-hole games. Strangely, the bottom portion looks like an F1 racer because, hey, why not?</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_golf_push_cart_caddy.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_golf_push_cart_caddy.jpg" style="height:737px;width:1020px;" alt="Render of a golfer using the Navee Eagle F1X as its caddy, following behind." data-uuid="4179c3ca-cdad-4d2c-9fc7-1a1c6447a036"><figcaption>Navee Eagle F1X</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Navee</div></figure><p>To further prove that Navee isn&#39;t afraid to jump the shark, the company has a product that could, well, jump over sharks. The WaveFly 5X is an electric seaplane that can &quot;glide on the water and ride into the sky.&quot; The company claims a max speed of 53 mph, a cruising speed of 40 mph, and a maximum flight time of 70 minutes. I&#39;m not ready to put my life in its hands, but surely some deep-pocketed adventurer will.</p><p>In addition to real-world ranges almost always being much lower than advertised, there are other caveats. First, post-purchase customer support in the world of micromobility is almost always a sketchy prospect. I once had to file a Better Business Bureau claim to get support from even the most well-established brand, Segway. Don&#39;t be shocked to experience the same or worse from lesser-known companies.</p><p>Second, Navee hasn&#39;t yet listed pricing or release dates for its new models. Based on their specs and the company&#39;s older gear, you&#39;ll likely see prices of well above $1,000 for each one. (And that’s not even counting the seaplane.)

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to your first CES edition of TMA, attempting (almost futilely) to distill the biggest product reveals and announcements. Despite two days of briefings and conferences, today is merely day one. However, we’ve already seen Sony Honda reveal <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html">its next car</a> — and the Afeela 1 isn’t yet on sale. We’ve got a deep dive on what we’ve seen so far, right here.</p>
<p>AMD announced new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-ai-400-chips-are-a-big-boost-for-laptops-and-desktops-alike-033000635.html">Ryzen AI 400 laptop processors</a> and updated desktop chips, including the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, with a new focus broadly on AI processing improvements. NVIDIA had a lengthy, dense press conference showing off its dominance in AI tech, but it lacked major consumer announcements — until overnight, when it revealed next-gen G-Sync tech and an upgraded version of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html">DLSS</a>. The new tech can handle up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance. It also adds an improved version of Super Resolution Transformer, with more stability.</p>
<p>This year’s wildcard CES press conference was… Lego? It revealed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html">Smart Bricks</a>, which adds sensors, audio and wireless communication to traditional Lego pieces. The system is launching with Star Wars sets later this year — and perhaps crucially, no smartphone or screen is needed to play.</p>
<p>There’s also LG and Samsung to get into — more on those below!</p>

<p>After launching its double-folding smartphone in Korea, Samsung is giving its newest foldable the press tour at CES 2026 and, despite reservations, it’s slick. The key difference between the Z Trifold and the Z Fold series is a second fold-out wing, turning it from a traditional smartphone into a more tablet-like form factor, closer to what we’re used to. Farewell square-ish screens.</p>
<p>This is what we were promised when foldables first appeared: a larger screen that offers greater utility than traditional smartphones, without compromise. Sam Rutherford tested one out. Read on for his impressions.</p>

<p>The big reveal at Samsung’s First Look CES press conference was literally big: a flagship 130-inch Micro RGB TV framed by a giant metal easel with embedded speakers. It’s much more in the realm of concept than reality — no price, no release date. It works as a halo product for more realistic TV sets using Samsung’s new preferred display technology. This year it’ll be offering TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. And if you’re curious, <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html">we explain what Micro RGB TVs are</a>.</p>

<p>CES 2026 marks the return of LG’s ultra-thin Wallpaper TV. The latest version sports a gorgeous OLED screen and wireless connectivity, and it’s about as thin as a pencil. We checked out the new Wallpaper TV during a CES preview event, along with LG’s Gallery and Micro RGB sets. If money were no object, I’d want a 100-inch LG Wallpaper TV. According to Devindra Hardawar, it looks “shockingly thin” in person.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-specs-price-the-first-dual-screen-laptop-worth-buying-130016756.html" data-i13n="slk:ASUS Zenbook Duo;cpos:1;pos:1">ASUS Zenbook Duo</a> was easily one of my favorite laptops of 2024 as it was the first dual-screen notebook actually worth buying. But now at CES 2026, ASUS has given the second-gen model a complete revamp with practically all the upgrades and tweaks I’ve been hoping for.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the rest of the Zenbook line, the 2026 Duo is getting ASUS’ Ceraluminum treatment on its lid, bottom and kickstand, which not only looks great but it adds an extra bit of durability and scratch resistance. There’s also an improved magnetic latch system and Bluetooth connection for its detachable keyboard to help keep it charged up and paired more reliably. However, the biggest upgrade is ASUS’ all-new &quot;hideaway&quot; hinge. Not only does it allow the system to unfold flat against a table, it also massively shrinks the gap between the laptop’s two 3K 144Hz Lumina Pro OLED displays to just 8.28 mm. That’s a reduction of 70 percent compared to the previous model and it makes the idea of using a dual screen laptop just that much more seamless and appealing than before.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="a968affa-7848-473e-a72f-b5e186aa81b3"/><p>Another important upgrade is that despite having a significantly larger 99Whr battery (up from 75Whr on its predecessor), the overall footprint of the second-gen Zenbook Duo is actually five percent smaller than before. That makes it noticeably more compact without sacrificing on weight or thinness, which is staying pretty much the same at 3.6 pounds and 0.77 to 0.9 inches thick (depending on where you measure). Connectivity remains excellent as well, with ASUS including Wi-Fi 7, two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 connector and even a full-size HDMI 2.1 jack. And for all the artists out there, the Zenbook Duo also supports stylus input via the ASUS Pen 3.0, so you can easily detach the wireless keyboard and use either screen as a built-in drawing tablet. That said, it’s currently unclear if the stylus comes included or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile on the inside, the Zenbook Duo features either an Intel Core Ultra 7 355 or Ultra 9 386H chip with up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. On top of that, ASUS increased the Duo’s TDP to 45 watts, which is another notable bump up over the original. So not only does it have a larger battery, its performance is getting a big boost as well, especially when combined with the much improved onboard graphics from Intel’s latest integrated Arc GPU.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Zenbook-duo-new-vs-old.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Zenbook-duo-new-vs-old.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Here&#39;s how the new 2026 ASUS Zenbook duo (right) stacks up against the outgoing model (left).

But as the kind of person who feels like they are missing a limb when I’m traveling and away from my two monitors at home, the second-gen Zenbook Duo feels like a major refinement of an already great idea. It’s got a bigger battery, faster performance and a hugely streamlined design without gaining any bulkiness or weight. Out of all of the laptops I’ve seen at CES 2026, this is the one I most wish I could grab and start using right away.&nbsp;</p><p>The one potential concern is that ASUS has yet to release pricing for the new Zenbook Duo or say when it will go on sale. So here’s hoping it won’t break the bank when it arrives sometime later this year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-asus-zenbook-duo-got-a-fantastic-redesign-for-ces-2026-173000392.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Eric Migicovsky has been thinking a lot about friction. Specifically, he’s been thinking about how too much friction in the way of using a device can put people off wearing it altogether. The founder of Pebble is here <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">at CES 2026</a> with a few new devices from the company he recently started to bring back the beloved smartwatch brand, including the Pebble Round 2 and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-is-making-a-weird-little-smart-ring-for-recording-thoughts-161723645.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the Index 01</a>. That second one is a simple ring with a button on it that you push down to talk to Pebble’s AI whenever you want it to help you remember something. </p><p>In the sea of AI gadgets that clutter the showfloors of CES (and the current tech industry in general), the Index 01 is refreshingly simple. The prototypes I saw here in Las Vegas weren’t connected to phones, so they weren’t actually working. They also seemed a little unfinished, like there was still some polishing to do. But I was able to put a few on and push their buttons. I also checked out the one Migicovsky wears — more on that in a bit.</p><p>I have to caveat that the rings that Migicovsky and his team had for us to try on were way too large for me. I did manage to get sized and found out I was a Pebble size 7, while my colleague Dan Cooper was determined to be a size 11. These demo rings sat loosely on my finger — and Migicovsky was particular that I wear it on my index finger and not my thumb or middle finger. </p><p>I suspect that has to do with how you reach for and press the button. It’s much easier to push the key if it’s closer to your thumb. Since the idea of the Index 01 began as an app on the Pebble watch, Migicovsky has been working hard to figure out how best to make it easy to access. Back when it was an app, “friction points were having to use your other hand” to press the screen, he said. “We also experimented with gestures and voice activation, wake words,” he added. But as many of us are painfully familiar with, those triggers don’t always work well. </p><p>“The whole thing that drives this ring is it being something that you can rely on. It being something that you can incorporate into your… habits,” Migicovsky said. So putting a button right by your thumb not only makes sense, but might even be, in my opinion, a bit more accessible for people with, say, speech impediments or only one hand. </p><p>I have to admit I initially found the Index 01’s design to be a bit bulky-looking, and the rubbery button protrudes a lot more than I expected from looking at it in its glamor shots. It’s like in place of a diamond or a gemstone on the ring, there’s a weird little nipple that you twiddle around until you want to push it. </p><p>I did find the button easy to press, if that allays any of your concerns at all. But, really, the Index’s powers aren’t visible. It’s what happens after you push the button that matters. </p><h2 id="jump-link-using-the-pebble-index-01-ring">Using the Pebble Index 01 ring</h2><p>The actual demo was brief. Migicovsky prefaced things by telling me what he was about to ask, held up his hand to his mouth, pushed the button and asked me “What’s your favorite book these days?” I explained I had recently been reading <em>Kaiju Preservation Society </em>by John Scalzi and then Migicovsky let go of the button. </p><p>After a few starts and stops due to internet woes, the companion app on his phone responded, showing a transcription of what we said, followed by an answer “That sounds like a fun read! I can create a note about the book you are reading if you’d like.”</p><p>I didn’t get to ask many more questions, and I think I’d need to live with an actual unit in my life to start to rely on it more. But I love the idea of a second brain or an AI assistant that’s always ready for my random thoughts at the push of a button. Migicovsky said the Index 01 is water resistant, so you never have to take it off, even in the shower. So for those times when you’re sudsing up and have a random stroke of inspiration about soap art, you can still tell the Index 01 to remember your Eureka moment.</p><p>Migicovsky said you can also double click the button (and then hold it) to access a different side of the AI. Instead of simply remembering things you tell it, the AI can try to provide answers. Pebble’s AI is powered by Claude, so the usefulness of these results is going to be dependent on that model.</p><p>Depending on how you use it, Migicovsky said the Index 01 can last for years — up to three if you’re not too heavy of a user. Since he doesn’t want for you to have to place the ring on a charger and forget to put it back on again, the device is not rechargeable. When you’re about a month away from running out of juice, the app will send you a warning and ask if you want to order a replacement. You’ll also be offered the option of sending it in for recycling.</p><p>That still feels a bit wasteful and potentially expensive, but Migicovsky’s thinking is that if you still are using the ring enough after two years to be thinking about extending its battery life, the price might be justifiable to you.</p><h2 id="jump-link-why-a-pebble-ai-ring-instead-of-others">Why a Pebble AI ring instead of others?</h2><p>It’s things like this that make me think Migicovsky (and the Pebble team) have the right approach to making an AI ring. Though the hardware is not the most advanced and there is a quaint simplicity to the software, there is a level of thought and care that feels important to any product’s success. </p><p>Migicovsky is quick to acknowledge that Pebble watches won’t be for everyone. That if you want a health-tracking device or something with a bright, colorful screen, you should consider something else. He’s even considering placing ads for other smartwatches on the website listing the new Pebble devices.</p><p>“Look — I’m the first person to call myself out when I fail,” Migicovsky wrote in a blog he posted last November. And when he spoke with Engadget, he also recognized that Pebble at one point might have tried to do too much. These days, there are other companies making smart rings that are all about tracking your sleep and fitness, and the Index 01 is not that. “And Pebble is absolutely 100 percent not that company.” Maybe with a renewed focus on a sustainable business model, Pebble actually has a chance to survive and continue making its AI ring and other devices. </p><p>Nowadays, Migicovsky just wants to make gadgets that will make you smile. And when I look at a cute little nyan cat wiggling about in its lo-fi, lo-res and low-frame-rate glory on the new Pebble smartwatches, I just feel warm inside. </p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://repebble.com/index" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Index 01 is available for pre-order now</a> at an early bird price of $75 and will cost $100 after it starts shipping in May.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebbles-founder-might-be-just-the-right-person-to-make-an-ai-ring-170104222.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, PocketBook <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/inkposter-uses-an-e-paper-display-to-bring-art-to-your-home-170016899.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">rocked up at CES with a series of large e-paper displays to display art on the walls of your home</a>. This year, the company has turned up with a far larger, A1-sized model called the Duna, which it says mimics the “texture, depth and tonal richness of printed paper.” It’s intended to act as an upmarket alternative to those big screen TVs which display art when they’re not being used for their intended purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, such a fancy product also needs some fancy accessories, so it’s recruited Italian design house Pininfarina to help. It claims the credit for the Duna’s “precision-engineered aluminum frame” and its “elegantly stitched Alcantara.” To celebrate the pairing, the InkPoster App will enable you to view original design sketches from the Pininfarina archives on your screens.&nbsp;</p><p>At last year’s CES, I <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/inkposter-uses-an-e-paper-display-to-bring-art-to-your-home-170016899.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">saw the three smaller models</a> in person and found them to be very promising. The colors are vibrant in a way you don’t expect from an e-paper display, and at a distance you could easily mistake these for a real canvas. Just don’t get too close to the screen itself, since you’ll still be able to see the pixels rather than brush strokes. I’m no expert, but I suspect the technology suits bold, blocky art styles — think modern artists like Modigliani — better than delicate, more antiquated forms.</p><p>As before, each InkPoster can be hung for up to a year on a single charge, refreshing from its library of licensed artwork according to your whims. Plus, you can use it as a digital photo frame, if you want to display your selfies at art gallery or movie poster sizes.</p><p>If you’re interested in buying one of the new models, you’ll have to wait until April, after the frames are exhibited at Milan Design Week in April. While we don’t have full pricing details right now, you can expect to pay something in the region of $6,000 for one.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/inkposter-launches-a-premium-41-inch-e-paper-display-for-your-home-170000292.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>The following article discusses themes of an adult nature.</em></strong></p><p>Lovense has turned up to CES with a “companion doll,” a life-size sex doll that’s designed to be more than just a life size <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-11-realdolls-first-sex-robot-took-me-to-the-uncanny-valley.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">sex doll</a>. The company has equipped it with its proprietary AI engine and promises “human-like cognition, emotional awareness and expressive behavior.” The doll, which in the marketing video is called Emily, is Lovense’s answer to the global loneliness crisis. It says, over time, a user’s relationship with the system will grow deeper as it learns to adapt to their needs. And that the doll is the natural evolution of the virtual companions that have, until now, “existed only on phones and screens.”</p><p>From a hardware standpoint, the doll uses a standard user posable skeleton for everywhere but inside the skull. Up top, there are various servos and mechanisms to give the doll the ability to slightly move their mouth while speaking, as well as some basic facial expressions. (You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Emily attempt a smize or a wink in a matter few would describe as flirtatious.) The company hasn’t spoken about the less delicate parts of her anatomy, but did say her built in Bluetooth can “integrate effortlessly with the full Lovense ecosystem” and can run for eight hours on a single charge.</p><p>The major focus, however, is on the AI part of the equation, explaining it will remember details of previous conversations to enable users to build a deeper bond with its user. In addition, you can even engage with the AI when you’re out and about, messaging it via the Lovense app. Oh, and you can even get “AI-generated selfies that mirror her real-world appearance” should you want. The company, in its materials, say that the doll will hopefully lead people out of their comfort zone and better equip them to engage with real people.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it’s worth noting that Lovense’s track record with people’s most intimate data isn’t the best. In 2017, a Reddit user discovered the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-10-connected-sex-toys-recorded-intimate-sessions-without-consent.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Lovense app was recording a private moment</a> between them and their partner. In July 2025, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/a-lovense-security-flaw-may-be-letting-people-take-over-accounts-without-a-password-160528730.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">another security flaw enabled</a> hackers to hijack accounts without a password. The company addressed both issues at the time, but it’s one to consider if you’re thinking about forming a long-term relationship with one of its bots.</p><p>There’s no word on pricing or availability just yet —the company will be launching a pre-sale in the near future — but you can probably expect it to be fairly expensive.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lovense-launches-an-ai-companion-doll-at-ces-170000490.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As soon as I held the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-brings-its-round-faced-smartwatch-back-from-the-dead-150000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Pebble Round 2</a> in my hand, I suddenly realized what I’d been missing for the better part of a decade. I’ve always felt smartwatches should supplement, rather than supplant, your phone, but that’s an attitude that feels almost quaint these days. After all, Apple and Samsung believe everyone wants a watch that can do almost everything your phone can do. But that wasn’t the prevailing opinion at the dawn of the smartwatch era, either philosophically or from limitations in the technology. Back then, companies like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-25-pebble-smartwatch-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Pebble</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-18-vector-luna-smartwatch.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Vector</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-14-basis-peak-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Basis</a> and others all built devices that added a second screen to the device in your pocket, and were all the better for it. Thankfully, Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky agrees, and if his project to revive the company is successful, perhaps we’ll once again see these alternative approaches flourish. The first step on this very long road is the Pebble Round 2, which aims to be the standard bearer for a new generation of comparatively <em>less smart</em>, but fundamentally more useful, smartwatches.</p>
<p>Round 2 was announced on January 2, and is the second product in Core Devices’ (Migicovsky’s new company) lineup of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-founder-eric-migicovsky-just-introduced-two-new-e-paper-smartwatches-160008363.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">revived Pebbles</a>. The first was the revamped Time 2, aping the form of its more successful predecessor, while the Round 2 is an attempt to correct the mistakes of 2015’s Pebble Time Round. That watch, when it debuted, was met with disappointment from critics who loved its aesthetics but little else. Back then, building a Pebble with a round face required plenty of compromise, including a higher price, shorter battery life, fewer features and a massive bezel. A decade on, and the technology has come along sufficiently to render such compromises moot, making for a much better device overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new watch has a 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen which stretches to the end of the case. Its display has been bonded to the glass crystal, dramatically improving the viewing angles and reducing glare. You should expect to get two weeks of life on a single charge, but it remains just 8.1mm thick, and you can really feel that lack of heft when it’s in your hand. In fact, compared to so many of its smartwatch peers, you could almost unironically describe it as dainty, making its case size feel almost comically large. On the materials side, the case feels strong enough that I think it would withstand the rigors of daily life, and I’m quite smitten with both the polished rose gold and brushed silver finishes.</p>
<p>On one hand, it’s hardly the major reason to buy a watch, but I’m deeply smitten by how much text the Round 2’s display can render. Even the fanciest of smartwatches aren’t that willing to display big reams of text for your ease of reading. I was tickled to read a lengthy Slack message which reminded me, again, of what I’ve been missing for all of these years. Perhaps that’s a sign of the broader benefits a device like this offers, which is the ability to tweak its UI to what you need, rather than being tied by the UI designers in Cupertino and Mountain View.</p>
<p>There are plenty of omissions in the spec list, including no optical heart rate sensor, no GPS and no speaker. I’m not weeping over any of them: I’ve not used my smartwatch’s GPS in years and yes, and Pebble is swerving away from the health and fitness market. I don’t want to take calls from my wrist, either, and while the omitted heart rate sensor is harder to take given their ubiquity, it’s been done to ensure the watch is thinner than many of its competitors. </p>
<p>Migicovsky is candid about Pebble’s failure, saying the company spent too much to become a global hardware brand. He invested heavily in inventory in anticipation of blockbuster sales that never came, similar to Peloton’s post-COVID slump. This time around, the focus is on ensuring the company remains sustainable over the long term and, hopefully, building a succession of products. Rather than big investments, he’ll make small batches of devices to cater to pre-orders and won’t water down his philosophy in the hope of attracting a broad user base. He even said the Pebble website may include recommendations for alternative smartwatches from other companies to ensure he’s only catering to the faithful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s his hope that this approach will give him the time and space to make more products, such as the already-announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-is-making-a-weird-little-smart-ring-for-recording-thoughts-161723645.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Pebble Index 01</a>. It’s a $75 ring equipped with a microphone, Bluetooth and a single push button, where users can record brief reminders to themselves. Rather than add weight and complexity with a rechargeable battery, each Index has a sealed-in cell that the company promises will last for up to two years. A month before the battery is due to expire, you’ll be asked if you want to buy a replacement, sending in the original for recycling. It’s an unusual arrangement but one that Migicovsky believes is more compelling than some others. After all, users aren’t saddled with any monthly subscription fees, and they only need to buy a new one if they’ve actually gotten the benefit out of their existing model. As with the revived Pebbles, the prevailing attitude is that nobody’s twisting your arm here.</p>

<p>More broadly, Migicovsky has the time and money now to explore these product ideas free from the usual pressures. He has no investors or backers demanding instant returns and fast growth, giving him license to pursue his ideas as far as he wants to take them. And he is determined to return a small degree of whimsy to consumer electronics, building gadgets that are in some way fun. Let’s hope he succeeds, because the industry can’t survive another decade of homogeneity.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Multiple of Satechi's Thunderbolt 4 docks are on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-docking-station-160041863.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Engadget's list of the best docking stations</a>, so when the company announces a new accessory, it's usually worth a look. At CES 2026, Satechi is finally making the jump to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-thunderbolt-5-launch-130006804.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Thunderbolt 5</a> with a new docking station and cable. The Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure and Thunderbolt 5 Pro Cable leverage the faster speeds of Intel's cable tech, and in the case of the dock, also include extra benefits like space for SSD storage.</p>
<p>The CubeDock is made from a block of solid aluminum and is clearly supposed to evoke Apple's desktop Macs, like the new Mac mini. Satechi already made <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/satechi-details-new-mac-mini-m4-stand-at-ces-2025-170038397.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a Mac mini hub</a> that can do some of the same things as CubeDock, but that accessory was focused on Thunderbolt 4. With the Thunderbolt 5 on the CubeDock, the new docking station can offer support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. </p>

<p>The dock also features a microSD card slot, SD card slots and headphone jack on the front, with multiple other input options on the back, including Thunderbolt 5 ports and an ethernet port. If you're interested in extra storage, you can also pop off the bottom of the CubeDock and add up to 8TB of SSD storage.</p>
<p>To pair with the CubeDock, Satechi is also releasing its own Thunderbolt 5 cable. The Thunderbolt 5 Pro Cable supports up to 120 Gb/s uni-directional or 80 Gb/s bi-directional data transfers, 240W power delivery and either dual 8K/60Hz displays or a trio of 4K/144Hz displays.</p>

The Galleon 100 SD is a mechanical keyboard with a 5-inch screen, two rotary encoders and a full complement of Stream Deck buttons.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Stream Deck is basically a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/elgatos-latest-stream-deck-is-a-900-rackmount-unit-for-pros-215003305.html" data-i13n="slk:collection of hot keys;cpos:3;pos:1">collection of hot keys</a> that execute various commands. It's been incredibly popular for streamers and the like, but it's also become a boon for PC gamers.</p>
<p>Corsair is advertising the Galleon 100 SD directly to gamers, so it boasts of hot keys being used to "access abilities, call in airstrikes and manage inventory without diving through menus." The Elgato Marketplace offers profiles for specific games, eliminating the need to manually program the buttons. The included screen can display relevant stats while playing.</p>
<p>However, this is a real Stream Deck. It has 12 big buttons, which can be programmed to do all kinds of things beyond gaming. People use it to stream, yes, but also to control smart home devices, assist with creative tasks and a lot more.</p>

<p>Everything is housed in a durable aluminum frame with gasket housing and six layers of sound dampening. There's a cushioned palm rest and configurable RGB lighting.</p>

Normally retailing for $23, you can pick one up for $16.</p> 
<p>The TimeCapsule case uses two AA batteries to offer up to 14 times the lifespan of the CR2032 battery that powers an AirTag. The company based those estimates on Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, so your mileage may vary. Once an AirTag is seated inside the case, which is a compact 4.45 x 1.57 inches, it is sealed shut with four screws at the corners. The case is fiber-reinforced, according to Elevation Lab, and rated IP69 waterproof.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The company says it’s intended for use cases where you might place an AirTag for long periods of time, like in a vehicle, a piece of luggage or a work bag.

At CES 2026, that meant new flagship productivity machines, reconsidered gaming notebooks and solid incremental updates across several major lineups. While we’re still seeing embargoes lift and hands-on time on the show floor, the announcements below reflect the most significant laptops we’ve seen so far. Plus, the list will grow as more companies reveal details throughout January 6 and beyond.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-book6-series">Samsung Galaxy Book6 series</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/9dce55c0-eab9-11f0-bef9-b1978212f09b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/9dce55c0-eab9-11f0-bef9-b1978212f09b" style="height:1125px;width:2000px;" alt="New Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs." data-uuid="e8976874-d578-3ca0-bad9-05fbd3b90c83"/><figcaption>New Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Samsung announced the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Galaxy Book6 family at CES 2026</a>, introducing three new laptops built around Intel’s Panther Lake chips: the Galaxy Book6, Book6 Pro and Book6 Ultra. The focus this year is on slimmer designs, improved thermals and longer battery life, with Samsung claiming up to 30 hours of video playback on the Book6 Ultra and Pro.</p><p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book6 Ultra sits at the top of the lineup, with configurations offering up to Intel Core Ultra X9 processors, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, including RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 options. Samsung says the Ultra delivers up to 1.6x better CPU performance and 1.7x improved graphics compared with the previous Galaxy Book generation, helped by a wider vapor chamber and a new dual-path fan system for GPU cooling.</p><p>Both the Book6 Ultra and Book6 Pro feature upgraded 2,880 x 1,800 AMOLED 2X displays with touch support, adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz and peak brightness of up to 1,000 nits. The laptops are thinner than their predecessors, with the Ultra measuring 15.4mm thick and the Pro coming in at 11.9mm — and Samsung has added haptic trackpads across the series for the first time. Pricing and release dates have not yet been announced.</p><h2 id="jump-link-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo">ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits." data-uuid="3b80f798-cec6-305a-954f-3f36c7222243"/><figcaption>On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>ASUS brought its dual-screen design into the gaming space at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ROG Zephyrus Duo</a>, a laptop that pairs two full-size 16-inch displays with high-end gaming hardware. Unlike productivity-focused dual-screen systems, the Zephyrus Duo is positioned as a hybrid machine designed to handle gaming, content creation and multitasking in a single portable setup.</p><p>Both 16-inch Nebula OLED panels support HDR with up to 1,100 nits of peak brightness, NVIDIA G-SYNC, stylus input and high color accuracy. Performance comes from Intel’s latest Core Ultra processors paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, up to an RTX 5090. While the system’s 135W power budget means it won’t match the raw performance of some single-screen gaming laptops, ASUS is clearly prioritizing versatility over maximum output.</p><p>The Zephyrus Duo includes a detachable wireless keyboard, a built-in kickstand and multiple usage modes, including stacked dual-screen layouts and drawing configurations. Despite weighing a whopping 6.28 pounds, ASUS has kept the chassis relatively slim at 0.77 inches and equipped it with a six-speaker system, vapor chamber cooling and a broad selection of ports including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1 and a full-size SD card slot. Pricing and availability have not yet been announced.</p><h2 id="jump-link-msi-stealth-16-ai">MSI Stealth 16 AI+</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/msi-raider-16-max.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/msi-raider-16-max.jpg" style="height:1062px;width:1600px;" alt="MSI&#39;s most powerful gaming laptop." data-uuid="4bf56ae4-fbf2-4fa3-9b3d-9a45f04249f2"/><figcaption>MSI&#39;s most powerful gaming laptop.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MSI</div></figure><p>MSI updated its Stealth lineup at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Stealth 16 AI+</a>, a gaming laptop designed to balance performance and portability. The system measures just 16.6mm thick, weighs under two kilograms and is equipped with NVIDIA RTX 50-series graphics alongside Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors.</p><p>Despite its slim profile, the Stealth 16 AI+ includes dual memory slots and dual SSD bays, giving it more upgrade flexibility than many thin gaming laptops. MSI is positioning it as a versatile machine for users who want gaming performance without the bulk typically associated with high-end hardware.</p><h2 id="jump-link-msi-crosshair-16-max-hx">MSI Crosshair 16 Max HX</h2><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Crosshair 16 Max HX</a> represents MSI’s more traditional gaming approach, pairing Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs. It sits below the company’s flagship Raider models but still targets players who want strong performance in a relatively streamlined chassis.</p><p>Buyers can opt for an optional QHD+ OLED display with a 165Hz refresh rate, adding sharper visuals and smoother motion for gaming and media. Alongside the Max HX, MSI also announced a Crosshair 16 HX variant, giving the Crosshair line a broader range of configurations aimed at mid-to-high-end gaming buyers.</p><h2 id="jump-link-hp-omnibook-ultra-14">HP OmniBook Ultra 14</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/omnibook-ultra-right-side-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/omnibook-ultra-right-side-2.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="HP claims the Omnibook Ultra 14 has passed 20 different MIL-STD 810H tests for things like extreme temperature and shock resistance." data-uuid="cb5ee58a-4970-3477-b25c-abfbc39ecf63"/><figcaption>HP claims the Omnibook Ultra 14 has passed 20 different MIL-STD 810H tests for things like extreme temperature and shock resistance.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>HP used CES 2026 to debut its new flagship consumer laptop, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-hp-omnibook-ultra-14-at-ces-2026-super-sleek-and-surprisingly-durable-170000330.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">OmniBook Ultra 14</a>. It’s a premium ultraportable built around an ultra-thin but durability-focused design. The laptop measures just 0.42 inches thick and weighs 2.8 pounds, yet HP says it passes 20 MIL-STD-810 tests for shock, drops and extreme temperatures. Rather than a traditional unibody chassis, HP uses a forge-stamped aluminum construction designed to improve strength and bend resistance.</p><p>The OmniBook Ultra 14 features a 3K OLED display and can be configured with up to 64GB of memory and 2TB of storage. Buyers can choose between Intel Core Ultra processors or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite, with the Snapdragon version offering a more powerful NPU rated at up to 85 TOPS for AI workloads. HP has also added a vapor chamber for the first time in an OmniBook to support sustained performance in such a slim chassis.</p><p>HP rounds things out with a large touchpad, quad speakers and three USB-C ports supporting Thunderbolt 4, DisplayPort 2.1 and fast charging. The OmniBook Ultra 14 is expected to go on sale later this month starting at $1,550.</p><h2 id="jump-link-hp-omen-max-16">HP Omen Max 16</h2><p>HP also refreshed its gaming lineup at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-hp-omnibook-ultra-14-at-ces-2026-super-sleek-and-surprisingly-durable-170000330.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Omen Max 16</a>, which the company describes as its most powerful 16-inch gaming laptop to date.

HP is positioning the laptop as the flagship of its Omen lineup, sitting above refreshed Omen 15 and Omen 16 models that target more mainstream gaming buyers.</p><p>Pricing and availability for the Omen Max 16 have not yet been announced, with HP expected to share more details later this year.</p><h2 id="jump-link-acer-swift-16-ai">Acer Swift 16 AI</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Acer_Swift_16_AI.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Acer_Swift_16_AI.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Promo photo of the Acer Swift 16 AI laptop" data-uuid="316175aa-d260-4828-bd31-66e5ba0071c2"/><figcaption>Promo photo of the Acer Swift 16 AI laptop</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>Acer expanded its flagship Swift lineup at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/acer-goes-big-on-the-haptic-trackpad-for-ces-with-the-swift-16-ai-laptop-230000750.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Swift 16 AI</a>, a large-screen ultraportable that leans heavily into input innovation and display quality.

It can be configured with up to an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H processor and Intel Arc B390 graphics, with up to 32GB of memory and 2TB of storage. Despite the large display, the laptop measures just 14.9mm thick and weighs about 3.4 pounds.</p><p>Acer says the Swift 16 AI is part of the Copilot+ PC program, positioning it around on-device AI features alongside performance and portability.

Instead of simplifying its product offering, the rebranding only bewildered consumers and tech journalists alike, both of which had come to know the XPS lineup to be synonymous with quality. Now, Dell is getting back to its roots and coming out with a whole refreshed lineup of XPS laptops, including new XPS 13, XPS 14 and XPS 16 machines. Specific details for each model still remain under wraps, and there’s no word yet on when they will hit the market.</p><h2 id="jump-link-alienware-gaming-laptops">Alienware gaming laptops</h2><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-teases-new-super-slim-and-entry-level-gaming-laptops-at-ces-2026-033000700.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Alienware used CES 2026 to tease a new ultra-slim gaming laptop</a> designed to sit below the company’s Area-51 flagships. The laptop measures roughly 17mm, or about 0.67 inches, thick and will be offered in both 14-inch and 16-inch sizes.</p><p>According to Alienware, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-16-area-51-review-a-fully-retooled-gaming-mothership-150000871.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">16-inch version</a> will feature NVIDIA discrete graphics paired with new, highly efficient CPUs. Rather than positioning it as a pure gaming machine, Alienware says the laptop is intended to balance gaming performance with creative work, productivity and everyday use.</p><p>Alienware has not shared pricing, availability or full specifications, and it remains unclear how the 14-inch and 16-inch models will differ beyond size.</p><p>Alienware also previewed a new entry-level gaming laptop aimed at expanding its reach to more budget-conscious players. While specs remain limited, the company says the system will deliver strong gaming performance at its most accessible price point yet.</p><p>Alienware suggests pricing should come in below the $1,199 starting price of the Alienware 16 Aurora, potentially making it the most affordable gaming laptop the brand currently offers.

The new QHD display, which uses LG Display&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.lgdisplay.com/eng/product/tv-display/oled-4th-gen">4th-gen RGB Tandem 2.0 OLED tech</a>, can hit 335 nits typical brightness and is DisplayHDR True Black 500 certified. At the same time, it offers an outstanding 540Hz refresh rate at QHD (720Hz at HD) and a .002ms grey-to-grey (GtG) response time. So in other words, about 5,000 times faster than the best human reflexes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Though a gaming monitor by design, the GX7 would make an excellent content creation monitor too thanks to the true 10-bit panel that delivers 99.5 percent DCI-P3 color gamma coverage and Delta E&lt;2 color accuracy. It&#39;s also UL certified for anti-glare, flicker-free, low blue light, reduced blue light and reduced circadian stimulating blue light. Finally, it carries VESA&#39;s ClearMR 21000 certification for the highest motion-clarity tier, eliminating the faint blur that can occur around fast moving objects. And as you&#39;d expect, it&#39;s NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro compatible.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Appearance wise, it&#39;s what LG calls &quot;virtually borderless&quot; and has adjustable height, tilt, swivel and pivot controls. For connectivity, you get Dual HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1 and Thunderbolt USB-C connectivity, along with two USB 3.0 downstream ports and a 4-pole headphone jack for audio and comms.</p> 
<p>The RGB Tandem OLED technology in the UltraGear GX7 is designed for speed and brightness and should not be confused with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.lgcorp.com/media/release/29720">LG&#39;s RGB V-Stripe OLED technology</a>. The latter tech maxes out at 240Hz and is oriented more toward clarity of text and other display elements. The UltraGear GX7 is now available for pre-order at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LG Electronics;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=caec6c25-9644-40a5-b7f6-c74a55e73035&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;linkText=LG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvbW9uaXRvcnMvbGctMjdneDc5MGItYi1nYW1pbmctbW9uaXRvciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2FlYzZjMjUtOTY0NC00MGE1LWI3ZjYtYzc0YTU1ZTczMDM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvbW9uaXRvcnMvbGctMjdneDc5MGItYi1nYW1pbmctbW9uaXRvciJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAar1DY-kT051hdlfH1TLKljgu1Q-2fGg4AMIC0bSPO-Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-27gx790b-b-gaming-monitor" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27gx790b-b-gaming-monitor">LG.com</a> and anyone who orders before February 1st will receive a $299 27-inch FHD 240Hz gaming monitor for free.&nbsp;</p>

That's because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots.</p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We'll be keeping this story updated throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-micro-rgb-tvs">Micro RGB TVs&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg" style="height:1423px;width:2000px;" alt="Samsung&amp;#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV." data-uuid="0e796659-fedf-4a07-9718-5aab3d0b16da"><figcaption>Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer</a> for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.</p><p>We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>.

Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung).

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. It all seems very neat and I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with these Smart Bricks.</p><p>The first “<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:30;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures.

It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that draft an email when you say you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.</p><h2 id="jump-link-robots">Robots</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Boston-Dynamics-Atlas.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Boston-Dynamics-Atlas.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas." data-uuid="eca6e520-f063-477a-afcd-7fb18656fa63"><figcaption>The product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Boston Dynamics</div></figure><p>Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll.

It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250 Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. </p><p>You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. </p><p>It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/66a8a0f0-ea3c-11f0-bfee-7797bdd266e8" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/66a8a0f0-ea3c-11f0-bfee-7797bdd266e8" style="height:1080px;width:1530px;" alt="8BitDo FlipPad" data-uuid="725a4eb2-b568-334f-b4b9-0726fec4b7c3"><figcaption>8BitDo FlipPad</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">8BitDo</div></figure><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdo-is-unveiling-a-new-mobile-gaming-pad-at-ces-134555603.html" data-i13n="cpos:67;pos:1">FlipPad</a> is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year.

But on the other, all this fancy tech comes with an even higher price — around $2,500 based on current conversion rates from Korean won — not to mention the added bulk you get from a third folding panel. So even as someone who has used a foldable as my daily driver for almost a decade straight, it felt like Samsung’s latest high-end phone was going backwards in terms of both portability and affordability. But then at CES 2026, I got a chance to go hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold and all of my concerns pretty much instantly disappeared because with this thing, flexing is believing.</p><p>My initial consternation comes in large part from using the Z Fold 7, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/foldable-phone-makers-have-solved-every-issue-except-one-130000891.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">hit a major milestone this year thanks</a> to a revamped design that doesn’t come with any added size or weight even when compared to comparable candybar-style phones like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-too-much-ai-not-enough-ultra-140022798.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. That’s a major breakthrough considering how hefty and chunky the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-14-samsung-galaxy-fold-redesign-review-durability-screen.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">original Galaxy Fold</a> was back in 2019. And when you compare the Z Fold 7’s dimensions (7.58 ounces and 8.9mm thick when folded) to the new TriFold (10.9 ounces and 12.9mm when folded), there’s no doubt that Samsung’s new flagship foldable comes with a lot of extra bulk. To put things into context, we have to go back several generations to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-5-review-five-years-in-samsung-is-treading-water-140002461.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Z Fold 5</a> just to find a comparable phone with similar thickness (13.4mm). And even then, that handset is still significantly lighter than the TriFold at 8.92 ounces.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-thickness.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-thickness.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="There&#39;s simply no denying that the Z TriFold (left) is a much bulkier device than the Z Fold 7 (right). " data-uuid="0436edc2-2210-4ce3-b714-3643112973bc"/><figcaption>There&#39;s simply no denying that the Z TriFold (left) is a much bulkier device than the Z Fold 7 (right). </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>But then I opened it up and my concerns were quickly pushed aside because suddenly you’re greeted with 10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness. As a phone that can pull double duty as a tablet, the jump up from the Z Fold 7’s 8-inch main display cannot be understated. Not only does it make multitasking so much easier, when combined with Samsung’s DeX desktop mode, you basically get a miniature laptop experience from a device that fits in a pocket. Especially if you don’t mind carrying around a travel-friendly mouse and keyboard. Plus, you can connect the TriFold to an external display (either wired or wirelessly) to access even more screen space. Way more than with the Z Fold 7, I can honestly see myself leaving my PC at home and using the TriFold as my primary work device.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important but easily overlooked upgrade on the Galaxy Z Trifold is the 4:3 aspect ratio for its 10-inch main display. Compared to the Z Fold 7 and its almost perfectly square screen, you just get so much extra room on the sides for widescreen movies and shows. I tested this out by watching the trailer for Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Odyssey</em>, and even though that movie uses a super wide aspect ratio due to being filmed entirely on IMAX cameras, the viewing experience was just so much better. Peak watchability is something the regular Z Fold line has sort of left by the wayside as the company moved to larger exterior displays, which resulted in the series’ primary screen becoming more square. The one downside though is that the TriFold may make you more of a resolution snob, as it’s a lot easier to tell the difference between 1080p and 2K or 4K on a larger 10-inch panel.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="8ace2500-60c9-402d-824d-64866eb5f9cd" /><p>The final pillar of the TriFold’s kit is all the engineering that Samsung put into making it easy to open and close. Simply moving from one hinge to two while adding a third folding panel undersells the complexity of its design. Samsung actually uses two different types of magnets that push or pull depending on where they are, which makes accessing the TriFold’s primary display practically just as easy as on the Z Fold 7. That’s no small feat. Opening and shutting this thing is just so satisfying on a tactile level, and that’s before you consider that there’s basically no downgrade in terms of image quality.&nbsp;</p><p>While there’s only one way to unfurl the TriFold, which might seem confusing at first, Samsung addressed that too by throwing up a warning and making the whole phone vibrate if you try to do it wrong. And then there are components like the glass-reinforced carbon panels Samsung uses to add strength and durability to its chassis while keeping it as thin as possible. The one potential concern in the future is that unlike Samsung’s older foldables, there’s not as much room for improvement to shrink its dimensions much further, as the TriFold’s slimness is currently limited by the size of its USB-C jack. So if the next model wants to make big gains there, it may need to go completely portless.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Z-Fold-TriFold-movie-watching.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Z-Fold-TriFold-movie-watching.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Here&#39;s what The Odyssey trailer looks like on the Z TriFold (right) compared to the Z Fold 7 (left).

I really don’t want to go back to bigger, heavier phones that are even more bulky <em>and</em> expensive than the Z Fold 7. But the appeal is impossible to deny and for people who love a good multitasker, I can easily see how these tradeoffs are worth the upside of Samsung’s latest apex foldable.&nbsp;</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is currently on sale in South Korea, though we’re still waiting for official pricing and availability for the US and North American market.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold is one of many new technologies <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Samsung announced</a> at CES 2026.

<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p>
<p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;cpos:3;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward. </p>

<h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2>
<p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p>
<p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p>
<p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p>

The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p>
<p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2>
<p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;cpos:6;pos:1">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p>
<p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p>
<p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2>
<p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p>
<p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2>
<p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p>
<p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p>
<p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p>
<p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jensen Huang took to the CES stage on Monday to share the latest from NVIDIA,  and while the presentation was more a refresher of technologies the company has been working on for the past few years, there were a couple of notable announcements. </p><p>NVIDIA announced  Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece of the release is Alpamayo 1 , a 10-billion parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says is capable of approaching driving more like a human being would. The model works by breaking down unexpected driving situations into a smaller set of problems before finding the safest  path forward. At each step of the way, the model can explain its reasoning. </p><p>A sister model named AlpaSim allows developers to do closed-loop training for driving scenarios that are rarely encountered in real life. Huang said the 2025 Mercedes Benz CLA will be the first vehicle to ship with NVIDIA’s entire AV stack, including Alpamayo. "Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous," Huang said. </p><p>Following the Alpamayo announcements,  a pair of BD-1 droids from <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </em>joined Huang on stage. We saw one join the executive at last year’s CES. After that, Huang turned to Vera Rubin. NVIDIA <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_(microarchitecture)" data-i13n="slk:first announced the GPU architecture in 2024;cpos:1;pos:1">first announced the GPU architecture in 2024</a>, and now the company has begun production on a super computer that makes use of the new tech. One Vera CPU has 88 custom Olympus cores and 1.5TB of system memory for a total of 227 billion transistors. Meanwhile, one Rubin GPU features 336 billion transistors. Each Vera Rubin supercomputer has a pair of both components.   </p><p>Following the presentation, NVIDIA held a separate briefing where it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/dlss-path-tracing-g-sync-pulsar-ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced DLSS 4.5 and G-Sync Pulsar</a>. The latest version of NVIDIA’s upscaling technology was trained on a second-generation transformer model, which should reduce ghosting and shimmering, leading to a more stable image, even when there’s a lot of movement on screen. As part of DLSS 4.5, NVIDIA is also adding support for 6x multi-frame and dynamic generation.  The two features will arrive sometime in the spring. The former allows a 50-series GPU to generate five frames for every traditionally rendered frame. The idea here is to allow a powerful GPU like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review-pure-ai-excess-for-2000-140053371.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">RTX 5090</a> to saturate a 4K, 240HZ display with as many frames as possible.  Dynamic frame generation, meanwhile, is exactly what it sounds like. DLSS 4.5 can dynamically scale the number of generated frames to fit the scenario. In demanding scenes, your 50-series GPU will generate more frames, while scaling back during less hectic ones so it only computes what it needs.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4cfzFd9HzU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>As for <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=29e2c7bd-fe16-414f-bbd5-59e8cb1322d2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;linkText=G-Sync+Pulsar&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2dlZm9yY2UvbmV3cy9nLXN5bmMtcHVsc2FyLWdhbWluZy1tb25pdG9ycy1hdmFpbGFibGUtamFudWFyeS03LTIwMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyOWUyYzdiZC1mZTE2LTQxNGYtYmJkNS01OWU4Y2IxMzIyZDIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm52aWRpYS5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2Vmb3JjZS9uZXdzL2ctc3luYy1wdWxzYXItZ2FtaW5nLW1vbml0b3JzLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1qYW51YXJ5LTctMjAyNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARUWZFkbmjckP-EG15JXrZI__WL77V0Joy-Crx7OJLuV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fg-sync-pulsar-gaming-monitors-available-january-7-2026%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NVIDIA;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-sync-pulsar-gaming-monitors-available-january-7-2026/">G-Sync Pulsar</a>, it’s the latest improvement to NVIDIA’s flicker reduction technology. By pulsing a display’s backlight, NVIDIA says it can deliver perceived motion clarity relative to 1,000Hz, leading to greater clarity.  Those same displays will also ship with the ability to automatically adjust their brightness and color temperature to ambient lighting conditions.  Pre-orders for the first batch of  G-Sync Pulsar displays will open on January 7. </p><p><strong>Update 01/06/26 9:30AM</strong>: Added information about <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">DLSS 4.5</a> and G-SYNC Pulsar.  </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html?src=rss]]></description>

AI was everywhere, chipmakers dominated the schedule and a handful of brands used the pre-show window to quietly drop meaningful hardware updates.</p><p>Below are the biggest announcements and trends from January 5, plus a few standout hands-ons from Pepcom and CES Unveiled.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-doubles-down-on-ai">LG doubles down on AI</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="LG&#39;s CLOiD robot." data-uuid="4f24430f-4e32-4bc7-a1ad-481a02508ce9"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s CLOiD robot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">LG’s World Premiere keynote</a> leaned hard into its vision of “Affectionate Intelligence,” with AI positioned as the connective tissue across TVs, appliances and even robotics. While most of the hardware was announced ahead of time, the company used the stage to show how its ideas fit together, including updated OLED TVs, Micro RGB panels and its ultra-thin Wallpaper TV.</p><p>The most memorable moment, though, was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-reveals-its-laundry-folding-robot-at-ces-2026-215121021.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">CLOiD</a>, LG’s humanoid home robot, which capped off the presentation with demos that were more theatrical than practical.

If you were hoping for new GeForce news, this wasn’t the keynote for you.</p><h2 id="jump-link-intel-tries-to-reset-the-pc-narrative">Intel tries to reset the PC narrative</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/intelcoreultra.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/intelcoreultra.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="Image of a Core Ultra Series 3" data-uuid="9048a8a3-ce09-4feb-8d2d-1d0fdf1abd5d"/><figcaption>Image of a Core Ultra Series 3</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-intel-ces-2026-launch-event-130040089.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Intel’s press conference</a> followed NVIDIA’s with a more focused pitch: the launch of Core Ultra Series 3 processors, also known as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Panther Lake</a>. Built on Intel’s 18A process — that’s less than 2nm — the chips are designed to power the next wave of AI PCs, with improved graphics, better efficiency and stronger local AI performance.</p><p>The message was clear: Intel wants to convince partners and consumers that it’s back in the game for high-end laptops, even as competition from AMD, Qualcomm and Apple continues to intensify.</p><h2 id="jump-link-amd-closes-the-night-with-ai-first-silicon">AMD closes the night with AI-first silicon</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ryzen_AI_400_Series_04.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Ryzen_AI_400_Series_04.jpg" style="height:1164px;width:2000px;" alt="AMD Ryzen AI 400" data-uuid="ea3385b4-e182-4f56-873a-3a7a9f362525"/><figcaption>AMD Ryzen AI 400</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-amd-ces-2026-keynote-live-190012078.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">AMD wrapped up press day</a> with a keynote that mixed familiar AI rhetoric with meaningful chip announcements.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dell has unveiled an ultrawide, curved 52-inch 6K monitor at CES 2026. This productivity behemoth is designed for stock traders, engineers and other data professionals. Dell claims the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the world&#39;s first 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (but with that many qualifiers almost anything can be a world first).</p>
<p>Given Dell’s experience in the monitor realm, this could be a dream display for professionals who handle vast data sets such as trading platforms, AutoCAD, 3D rendering software, spreadsheets and more. It sports a 120Hz refresh rate on an IPS Black panel and emits up to 60 percent less blue light when compared to competing monitors. It delivers an impressive 129 ppi (for comparison a 4K 32-inch monitor delivers 138 ppi) and an ambient light sensor helps avoid eye strain during long work sessions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users can connect up to four PCs to the monitor simultaneously, which can use picture-by-picture to treat each partitioned screen as an individual monitor. It also features built-in KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) features that let users control all connected PCs via a single mouse and keyboard. The monitor can also charge your laptop with up to 140W of power via a Thunderbolt 4 connection.</p>
<p>Dell also rolled out a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with support for both True Black 500 HDR and Dolby Vision. It claims true-to-life color accuracy out of the box and excellent gamut coverage at 99 percent of DCI-P3. This monitor would be a strong fit for film and photo editing.</p>
<p>The Dell UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is priced at $2,900 with stand or $2,800 without. It will be widely available starting January 6. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor comes in at $2,600 and will be available beginning February 24.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-unveils-a-massive-52-inch-6k-ultrawide-monitor-at-ces-2026-140024029.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">NVIDIA</a> has unveiled the G-Sync Pulsar, which it calls the “latest evolution of [its] pioneering VRR (variable refresh rate) technology,” at CES 2026. The new tech promises a gaming experience that’s free of stutter with buttery smooth motion, which is made possible by pulsing the display’s backlight. G-Sync Pulsar displays have multiple horizontal backlight sections that are pulsed independently from top to bottom, unlike traditional displays whose backlight is always on. When the backlight is always active, the image fades from one frame to the next. The displays with the new tech give pixels in a frame enough time to stabilize before they’re backlit so that they’re shown in their right locations, effectively reducing monitor-based motion blur.  </p><p>The company says G-Sync Pulsar can effectively quadruple your refresh rate. If you’re playing at 250 fps, that means it can deliver a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz. That enables easier tracking and shooting in-game, making displays with the technology especially suited for esports. You can see the difference in motion in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> between a 360Hz monitor without G-Sync Pulsar and one with the technology switched on in the video below. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJlzDfCcNzw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>The first four displays designed specifically to support G-Sync Pulsar and Ambient Adaptive Technology, which allows users to automatically adjust color temperature and brightness based on ambient lighting, will be available starting on January 7. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI will each be releasing a 27-inch 2,560 × 1,440 IPS display, which comes with a 360Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of peak brightness in HDR.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-tech-can-minimize-motion-blur-for-gamers-140000058.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We see plenty of far-out ideas on the CES show floor, and this year Razer brought in a concept piece called Project Motoko. The device is Razer&#39;s take on blurring the line between a gaming headset and an AI-powered wearable for daily life. Or it&#39;s a way for <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> fans to feel affronted by Razer taking The Major&#39;s name in vain, take your pick.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Motoko is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon platforms. The headset has a pair of first-person view cameras positioned at eye level that can support real-time object and text recognition. It also has a wide field of attention that can capture things happening beyond the normal human eye&#39;s peripheral vision, and its microphone array is designed to capture both near and distant audio. In addition to taking in environmental details, Project Motoko can also operate as a wearable AI assistant, and the model is compatible with several different chatbots. The company&#39;s press release noted that it can integrate with Grok, OpenAI and Gemini. </p><p>&quot;Project Motoko is more than a concept, it’s a vision for the future of AI and wearable computing,&quot; Nick Bourne, Razer&#39;s global head of mobile console division, said in the press release about the device. &quot;By partnering with Qualcomm Technologies, we’re building a platform that enhances gameplay while transforming how technology integrates into everyday life. This is the next frontier for immersive experiences.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes concept designs we see at CES remain just that: thought experiments with no plan for commercial release. However, according to a rep from Razer: &quot;Our goal is to bring this headset to market in the near future, with a dev-kit available first followed by a full retail release.&quot; It should be interesting to see if Razer does commit to Project Motoko in the longer term. Razer is also well-established as a brand for serious gamers, so seeing the company explore making an AI wearable that could appeal to a broader audience, if still a geeky one, is an intriguing move.</p><p><strong>Update, January 6, 2026, 1:08PM ET:</strong> Added statement from Razer rep about future commercial prospects.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-motoko-is-a-concept-gaming-headset-that-doubles-as-an-ai-wearable-140000534.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Razer is once again thinking big about what a gaming chair can do, and its concept for CES 2026 isn&#39;t just a chair but an entire multisensory experience to match whatever&#39;s happening on-screen. The concept, called Project Madison, combines reactive lighting, spatial audio and multi-zone haptic feedback to make the player feel more immersed in the in-game environment. We&#39;re talking Razer Chroma light strips along the head flaps, THX Spatial Audio for 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound and six haptic motor actuators powered by Razer Sensa HD Haptics to bring the physical sensations of a game to life. </p><p>One can only imagine the price tag on such a setup. Actually, I&#39;d rather not. Project Madison isn&#39;t a product you can buy right now anyway, but Razer did bring a real — albeit far less flashy — new(ish) gaming chair to CES too. The company has updated its Iskur V2 lineup with the Iskur V2 NewGen, which features the same dynamic lumbar support and dual-density cold-cured foam seat cushion that it&#39;s known for, but now wrapped in Razer&#39;s Gen-2 EPU Leather with CoolTouch Technology for a long-lasting cooling effect.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Iskur_V2_NewGen.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Iskur_V2_NewGen.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Four Razer gaming chairs &#x002014; in light gray, black with green trim, black, and light pink &#x002014; are pictured beside each other spot-lit in a dark room" data-uuid="590b87fe-97e7-4cda-b531-5620edf5e1bd"/><figcaption>Razer&#39;s Iskur V2 NewGen chair in Light Gray, Black/Green, Black and Quartz.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Per Razer, &quot;The chair’s material delivers high thermal effusivity, keeping it cool to the touch for hours of play.&quot; That CoolTouch faux leather is also coming to the less expensive Iskur V2 X, with the Iskur V2 X NewGen. Pre-orders for both chairs are now open, though the company hasn&#39;t yet said when they&#39;ll ship. The $650 Razer Iskur V2 NewGen comes in Black/Green, Black, Quartz and Light Gray, while the $350 Iskur V2 X NewGen is available in Black/Green, Black and Quartz.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-madison-concept-chair-has-reactive-lighting-immersive-audio-and-multi-zone-haptics-140000118.html?src=rss]]></description>

Ring Sensors (for that is their name) is a new lineup of tools, built on Amazon’s Sidewalk low-power networking protocol. That includes updated versions of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-02-ring-protect-home-security-system.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFosSCo6ISp0KdhLHnu1rNGge0S1foVXhWpFAN9QN4wYvcCb9N2r-T7utBC6IVnPwKeCMlweVnHE9bHN69mRUqeL2UCT9JYcJqXeyv6yLdukUq_PaE72_B3MrXsF4nBKOhgndxkvNst1h9slQJkn_KJAeHVfKrjBTEJLXcmExr1v" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">door, window</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-glass-break-sensor-home-alarm-160001208.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">break glass sensors</a>, as well as a new OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. You’ll be able to pre-order the new car alarm today, while the rest of the new sensors will be available at some point in March. And, in tandem with that news, Amazon is announcing that Sidewalk is expanding outside of the US, starting in Canada and Mexico.</p><p>At the same time, the company is launching a number of enhancements to its app platform, including the Ring Appstore. This will let users purchase and integrate with third-party apps which have been built to cater to “specific use cases, from small business operations to everyday needs around the home.” The company added that, in the coming weeks, users will be able to browse a growing number of apps designed to help “you get more value from your Ring cameras.”</p><p>The company is also throwing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-uses-generative-ai-to-cut-down-on-unnecessary-alerts-150033561.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">more AI into its system</a> to better coordinate its alerts, including Unusual Event Alerts. These will learn from the patterns around your home and, when it spots something out of the ordinary, send you a ping. Active Warnings, meanwhile, will use computer vision to identify potential threats and offer “specific warnings based on details like location and actions.”</p><p>Finally, Ring has teamed up with Watch Duty, a non-profit alert platform designed to share useful information about local wildfires. The pair have added a Fire Watch feature to the Neighbors app to enable communities keep each other in the loop about local fire and smoke events. Ring users are encouraged to share details from their own Ring cameras to “support first responders on the ground.”</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-relaunches-its-suite-of-smart-home-sensors-140000667.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Paris court has found 10 people guilty of cyberbullying Brigitte Macron, wife of President of France Emmanuel Macron, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78v6z7597yo" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the <em>BBC</em> reports</a>. The judge found that the defendants made false claims about Macron's gender and sexuality, and "malicious remarks" about the 24-year age gap between Macron and her spouse.</p><p>Of the ten defendants, only one received a firm prison sentence of six months, according to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="c-link link" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2026/01/05/les-cyberharceleurs-de-brigitte-macron-condamnes-jusqu-a-6-mois-de-prison-ferme_6660611_3224.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>LeMonde</em></a>. Eight others received suspended sentences (effectively probation in France) of four to eight months, while the 10th person received a fine and was required to attend a sensitivity training course. Three of the “instigators” found guilty will lose access to their social media accounts for six months.</p><p>Key to the lawsuit is the fringe belief that Brigitte Macron was born a man — proponents for some reason believe Macron is Jean-Michel Trogneux, her older brother — and transitioned to living as a woman at some point later in life. This style of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://glaad.org/transvestigation-definition-meaning-anti-lgbt-online-hate/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">"transvestigation"</a> is an unfortunately common type of online conspiracy theory, a roundabout way to both spread hateful rhetoric about transgender people and bully cisgender people at the same time. The campaign against Macron has the added twist of her age: Brigitte Macron is 72, 24 years older than President Macron. The pair married in 2007, but their age difference has been an ongoing narrative throughout Emmanuel Macron's political career.</p><p>In July 2025, Macron also filed <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9f9f3597-08dc-42a1-8337-e67318bbf482&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=a+defamation+lawsuit+in+the+US+against+Candace+Owens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA3LzIzL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9tYWNyb24tbGF3c3VpdC1jYW5kYWNlLW93ZW5zLWRlZmFtYXRpb24uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWY5ZjM1OTctMDhkYy00MmExLTgzMzctZTY3MzE4YmJmNDgyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA3LzIzL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9tYWNyb24tbGF3c3VpdC1jYW5kYWNlLW93ZW5zLWRlZmFtYXRpb24uaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVDLcX-PqDG4_l1VrG3yQOGKoF7LmqUBGdNekhDcNQ1E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F07%2F23%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fmacron-lawsuit-candace-owens-defamation.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/world/europe/macron-lawsuit-candace-owens-defamation.html">a defamation lawsuit in the US against Candace Owens</a>, a right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist.
