Although Apple has not disclosed terms of the deal, sources told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Financial Times</em></a> that the arrangement is reportedly valued at nearly $2 billion.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A group of music publishers led by Concord Music Group and Universal Music Group <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gkplqybmavb/ANTHROPIC%20MUSIC%20COPYRIGHT%20LAWSUIT%20piracy.pdf"><ins>are suing</ins></a> Anthropic, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/anthropic-faces-new-music-publisher-lawsuit-over-alleged-piracy-2026-01-28/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. The suit accuses the AI company of illegally downloading more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, lyrics and compositions.</p>
<p>These songs were then allegedly fed into the chatbot Claude for training purposes. There are some iconic tunes named by Universal in the suit, including tracks by The Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond and Elton John, among many others. Concord is an independent publisher that handles artists like Common, Killer Mike and Korn.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The publishers issued a statement saying that the damages could amount to more than $3 billion. This would make it one of the largest non-class action copyright cases in US history.</p>
<p>&quot;While Anthropic misleadingly claims to be an AI &#39;safety and research&#39; company, its record of illegal torrenting of copyrighted works makes clear that its multibillion-dollar business empire has in fact been built on piracy,&quot; the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The suit was filed by the same legal team as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-will-pay-a-record-breaking-15-billion-to-settle-copyright-lawsuit-with-authors-192800292.html"><ins>last year&#39;s Bartz v. Anthropic case</ins></a>. The music publishers say they found that Anthropic had been illegally downloading thousands of songs during the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"><ins>discovery process of that suit</ins></a>.</p>
<div id="4616e9701c2d48308e64680cddd03411"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVpIt0Q35uc?si=l9W9sJxfKj87_9ks" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Bartz v. Anthropic case ended with an award of $1.5 billion to impacted writers after it was found that the company had illegally downloaded their published works for similar training purposes. The terms of that agreement dictated that the 500,000 authors involved in the case would get $3,000 per work. The $1.5 billion looks like a big number, but not so much when broken down like that. Also, Anthropic <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/anthropic-plans-raise-10-billion-350-billion-valuation-wsj-reports-2026-01-07"><ins>is worth around $350 billion</ins></a>.</p>
<p>In the Bartz case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it was legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content but not legal to acquire that content via piracy. We&#39;ll have to wait and see how this new suit shakes out. The legal precedent here seems to suggest that if Anthropic would have just spent a buck on each copyrighted song, then they&#39;d be in the clear. That&#39;s an odd distinction when it comes to building an entire company around snatching up copyrighted content, but whatever.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3-billion-over-flagrant-piracy-185459358.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past summer, Google DeepMind <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-3-can-dynamically-alter-the-state-of-its-simulated-worlds-140052124.html" data-i13n="slk:debuted Genie 3;cpos:1;pos:1">debuted Genie 3</a>. It’s what’s known as a world world, an AI system capable of generating images and reacting as the user moves through the environment the software is simulating. At the time, DeepMind positioned Genie 3 as a tool for training AI agents. Now, it’s making the model available to people outside of Google to try with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/project-genie/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Project Genie</a>. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YxkGdX4WIBE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>To start, you’ll need Google’s $250 per month AI Ultra plan to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">check out Project Genie</a>. You’ll also need to live in the US and be 18 years or older. At launch, Project Genie offers three different modes of interaction: World Sketching, exploration and remixing. The first sees Google’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Nano Banana Pro</a> model generating the source image Genie 3 will use to create the world you will later explore. At this stage, you can describe your character, define the camera perspective — be it first-person, third-person or isometric — and how you want to explore the world Genie 3 is about to generate. Before you can jump into the model’s creation, Nano Banana Pro will “sketch” what you’re about to see so you can make tweaks. It’s also possible to write your own prompts for worlds others have used Genie to generate. </p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that Genie 3 is not a game engine. While its outputs can look game-like, and it can simulate physical interactions, there aren’t traditional game mechanics here. Generations are also limited to 60 seconds, as is the presentation, which is capped at 24 frames per second and 720p. Still, if you’re an AI Ultra subscriber, this is a cool opportunity to see the bleeding edge of what DeepMind has been working over the past couple of years.         </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-project-genie-lets-you-generate-your-own-interactive-worlds-183646186.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Retro98 may look like it&#39;s made for playing <em>Quake</em> while you wait for <em>The Phantom Menace</em> trailer to drop.

The hand-built tower includes an LED fan-speed display, a working turbo button and a power-lockout key. Sticking with the nostalgic motif, its front I/O is hidden behind the Maingear logo. I can already hear The Beastie Boys&#39; “Intergalactic” playing in the background.</p><p>Fortunately, you won&#39;t be limited to 1998 games. (Dope as they are.)

Finally, the open-loop-cooled &quot;Alpha&quot; build is a whopping $9,799. Hey, those aren&#39;t 1998 prices!</p><p>The Retro98 also has an extremely limited run.

The incident took place in Santa Monica, California, on January 23. The company reported it to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">opened an investigation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The agency said the incident occurred close to a school within regular drop-off hours, with other children and a crossing guard nearby. The child ran from behind a double-parked SUV into the path of a Waymo Driver. Waymo said its vehicle detected the child immediately as they emerged and that the robotaxi braked hard to lower its speed from around 17 mph to under 6 mph at the time of impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Waymo said the child stood up immediately and moved to the sidewalk. The company contacted emergency services and the vehicle remained stationary at the side of the road until law enforcement allowed it to leave.</p><p>The NHTSA&#39;s Office of Defects Investigation will examine whether the Waymo Driver used appropriate caution given that it was close to a school during drop-off hours and children were close by. The probe is expected to look at the intended behavior of the vehicle&#39;s automated driving systems around schools (particularly during regular pick-up and drop-off times) and Waymo&#39;s response to the incident.</p><p>On the day that the incident took place, the National Transportation Safety Board <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/ntsb-will-investigate-why-waymos-robotaxis-are-illegally-passing-school-buses-160943613.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">opened an investigation</a> into Waymo over its vehicles improperly passing school buses in Austin, Texas.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honda and DriveOhio have teamed up on a new road safety <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/honda-corporate/releases/release-362088f67796c0d72b8469227602bc7d-honda-and-driveohio-complete-pilot-of-nations-first-proactive-roadway-maintenance-system-aimed-at-creating-safer-roads">initiative</a> in which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html">Honda</a> vehicles are being used to collect real-time data that can advise about potential issues and road deficiencies before they become a problem. Honda’s Proactive Roadway Maintenance System, which has been in prototyping since 2021, uses &quot;advanced vision and LiDAR sensors&quot; to identify issues such as worn or obstructed road signs, damaged guardrails, rough roads and emerging potholes.</p>
<p>During the pilot, members of the Ohio Department of Transportation’s smart mobility hub drove the test vehicles on around 3,000 miles of road in central and southeastern Ohio. They covered a mix of urban and rural environments, in varying weather conditions and at different times of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ODOT operators were able to review any flagged road or infrastructure deficiencies in real time using smart dashboards developed by Honda and tech firm Parsons. The University of Cincinnati helped Honda fit the sensors to its vehicles, led the development of the damage detection feature and assisted ODOT during the pilot.</p>
<p>The data collected by the vehicles was processed by Edge AI models and then passed on to Honda’s own cloud platform. The system then automatically generated work orders for ODOT’s maintenance teams in order of priority.</p>
<p>While a relatively small pilot in scope, the Proactive Roadway Maintenance System performed well in the trial across a number of metrics, delivering as high as 99 percent accuracy at highlighting damaged or obstructed signs. Accuracy was 93 percent for damaged guardrails and a slightly lower 89 percent for spotting potholes.</p>
<p>Honda says its technology could also detect high-severity shoulder drop-offs that were easy to miss in a routine visual inspection, while the system also proved reliable at measuring road roughness. The team that worked on the project estimated that if implemented on a larger scale, the automated system could save ODOT over $4.5 million a year.</p>
<p>Honda and its partners are now looking at ways to scale up the prototype Proactive Roadway Maintenance System for real-world use. The manufacturer also says it aims to eventually have similar technology in the vehicles of its customers, who will be able to share their own detection data anonymously and help create safer roads.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/honda-vehicles-used-to-proactively-report-road-safety-issues-in-nation-first-pilot-151629967.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has agreed to a preliminary $135 million settlement in a class action lawsuit brought by Android users who accused it of harvesting their data without consent. The suit alleged that since November 12, 2017, Google has been illegally collecting cellular data from phones purchased through carriers, even when apps were closed or location features were disabled.</p>
<p>As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-pay-135-million-settle-android-data-transfer-lawsuit-2026-01-28/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the affected users believed Google using their data for marketing and product development meant it was guilty of &quot;conversion.&quot; In US law, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conversion"><ins>conversion</ins></a> occurs when one party takes the property of another with &quot;the intent to deprive them of it&quot; or &quot;exert property rights over it.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Subject to approval from a judge, a settlement of $135 million was filed in a San Jose federal court earlier this week. The payout would be one of, if not the largest ever in a case of this nature, according to Glen Summers, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Each user involved in the lawsuit would be entitled to up to $100 from Google, which denies any wrongdoing and has agreed to seek consent during the setup process of a new phone from now on. A toggle will be added to enable users to easily disable data transfer, while the Alphabet-owned company will also adjust its terms of service accordingly. A trial is scheduled for August 5.</p>
<p>This is the second settlement this week for Google. On January 26, the company also <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-agrees-to-68-million-settlement-in-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-222405727.html"><ins>agreed</ins></a> to a $68 million settlement regarding claims that Google Assistant had been spying on users after being triggered by what it had misheard as wake words. Again, Google denied any wrongdoing in the class action suit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-pay-135-million-to-settle-illegal-data-collection-lawsuit-133012112.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s the year 2026 and the hottest game in my living room is <em>Fruit Ninja</em>. No, I&#39;m not in the midst of an ill-advised retro mobile gaming kick. Instead, my family and I have been jumping around and slicing flying fruit in our living room using the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nexplayground.com/?r=0" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Nex Playground</a>. It&#39;s a tiny gaming system built entirely around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-04-kinect-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Kinect</a>-like games. With its camera and onboard computer vision processing, the $249 Nex Playground can track up to four players as effectively as Microsoft&#39;s clunky old Xbox motion tracker. Simply put, the dream of the Kinect, as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-11-16-nintendo-wii-review-roundup.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Nintendo&#39;s Wii</a>, lives on in the Nex Playground.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, I was skeptical about Nex making a dent in the console arena. It&#39;s tough for new companies with no hardware experience to steal any limelight away from entrenched competitors like Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. But the Nex Playground&#39;s simplicity, accurate motion tracking and library of kid-friendly titles (including the likes of <em>Peppa Pig</em> and <em>Bluey</em>) has made it a hit among families. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260105396416/en/Nex-Playground-Showcases-Future-of-Active-Play-at-CES-and-an-Early-First-Look-at-its-2026-Product-Roadmap" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">company says it sold&nbsp;650,000 units</a> last year, which might not sound like much, but it was enough to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4rn3xk2w" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">beat the beleagured Xbox last November</a>.</p>

 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="d756c3f8-8e2c-402e-9931-9c944829c1cb" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?maas=maas_adg_27861A96B3EB230E7B0BB19CCA7340BA_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;th=1"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Honestly, I&#39;m just happy it gets my kids off the couch. I do my best to limit screen time with them, but as someone who has fond memories planted in front of my TV playing endless hours of SNES games, I also leave some room for my kids to explore tech and media on their own. I love the way <em>Minecraft&#39;s</em> near-limitless creative potential has unleashed my daughter&#39;s imagination, but I also want her to move more, especially in these winter months when we can&#39;t easily go outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the Nex Playground is another screen-based activity, the sheer variety of games to play keeps my kids entertained <em>and</em> it helps them break a sweat. The console’s version of <em>Fruit Ninja</em> is similar to that game&#39;s VR forays, where you have to stand up and make an effort to swipe your arms. You&#39;re not just dragging your fingers across a screen. <em>Go Keeper</em> gamifies the role of a soccer goalkeeper, which leads to my kids jumping all over our family room to block and catch stray balls. And we all love having mini-dance parties with <em>Starri</em>, which has you swinging your arms and dodging obstacles, similar to VR titles like <em>Beat Saber</em> and <em>Synth Riders</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to those three games, the Nex Playground comes with <em>Party Fowl</em>, a collection of mini games, as well as its own spin on <em>Whack-a-mole. </em>If you want more games, you have to subscribe to the Nex Play Pass for $89 a year or $49 for three months. The company also offers a $29 Sports Pack at Target stores, which includes tennis, basketball and bowling games. Beyond those options, though, there&#39;s no other way to add new titles to the Playground. You can&#39;t buy anything individually, and since the entire platform is digital, there&#39;s also no market for cheap used games like you&#39;d find for consoles.</p>
<p>Nex&#39;s subscription model is undoubtedly the Playground&#39;s biggest flaw, especially given the system’s $249 price. Instead of being an expensive console that you buy once (like an Xbox), and then occasionally purchase new titles for, the Playground is an ongoing commitment constantly calling for your wallet. To the company&#39;s credit, the device doesn&#39;t feature any ads or in-app purchases.</p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately, we would like to establish that long-term relationship ... we want to serve your family consistently with new content, and new updates all year round,&quot; Nex CEO David Lee said in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-why-is-the-nex-playground-ai-console-such-a-hit-181151201.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">an interview on the Engadget Podcast</a>. He noted that the company added twenty new games to its subscription over the last two years, as well as 40 game updates over the last year. Similar to Xbox&#39;s Game Pass, the goal is to maintain the Nex Play Pass&#39;s value over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could argue the Nex Play Pass&#39;s steep price isn&#39;t as bad as the $15 to $30 per child that indoor activity centers charge. Those godforsaken places only distract kids for a few hours at a time, and visiting one also comes with the risk of contracting exotic childhood illnesses. Theoretically, the Nex Playground could be something you turn to whenever you need to work out restless energy from your kids. And if that means parents could get a bit more sleep on the weekend, or just a few minutes to themselves for a cup of coffee, all of a sudden $89 a year doesn&#39;t seem so bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also impressed by the Nex Playground&#39;s hardware and software, both of which are far more polished than I&#39;d expect from a new hardware company. The device itself is a pastel-colored plastic box with a camera on the front (and a cute lens cover). You just have to plug it into power and an HDMI port, slap some batteries in the remote (which looks like an elongated Roku remote) and connect to Wi-Fi. It took a few minutes for the Playground to update the first time I turned it on, and I also had to create a Nex account using my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that initial setup phase was over, it took another five minutes to download the initial batch of five games to the Playground via my gigabit connection. That timing entirely depends on your internet setup — I&#39;ve seen reports of it taking up to 30 minutes to install the Nex&#39;s core games. I was also able to download the entire Play Pass library of titles in 35 minutes, but it could take a few hours on slower connections. Thankfully, those downloads happen in the background, so you can play other titles while waiting for new ones to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another plus? Once you&#39;ve downloaded the games, you can play them entirely offline. That makes it easier to grab the Playground and bring it on vacation, or to a friend&#39;s house, than it is to travel with other consoles. As long as you can reach a TV&#39;s inputs, have nearby power and clear out around six feet of space, you can play the Playground.</p>

<p>Nex&#39;s long experience developing motion-tracked games and experiences is a major reason why the Playground is so successful. The company previously created <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.homecourt.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Homecourt</a>, an app for tracking your basketball skills, as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.activearcade.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Active Arcade</a>, a collection of Playground-like minigames for iOS devices. Lee admitted that it’s tough to get parents to use their phones for things like Active Arcade. That led him to develop the Playground as a closed ecosystem, where the company could build a suite of games around a device where it could control every aspect of the hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that Nex Playground features games from well-known kids brands like <em>Peppa Pig</em>, it’s clear that Lee’s intuition has paid off. While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences. You don’t need to set up a clunky console or any additional accessories. Just plug in the Nex Playground, and you too could be hand-slicing virtual fruit on your TV in no time.</p>

You can pick them up for $199 right now, which is $50 off and the best discount we&#39;ve seen since the earbuds came out at the end of last year.</p> 
<p>We gave these AirPods a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">review</a> and we consider them the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds for iPhone</a> users. The third generation model is a substantial update to an already impressive product, bringing new features like live translation to the table.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="9d2a9c264099463ba10d3ed1a8a4d49b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 also offer heart-rate tracking, allowing them to stream live data to Apple Fitness and other third-party workout apps. This lets you track your fitness and close activity rings similarly to when using an Apple Watch.</p> 
<p>Apple also improved the sound quality of this generation thanks in large part to a redesigned acoustic architecture that improves how air is delivered into the ear canal. Additionally, the company changed the angle of the drivers to help more sound get where it needs to go instead of bouncing off the sides of your ear. We felt the jump in audio quality from the last generation to this one was substantial.</p> 
<p>The ANC on the AirPods Pro 3 has also been improved. Apple claims this model filters out twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. We found the noise cancellation to be top-notch.</p> 
<p>Live Translation is as neat as it sounds, leveraging the AirPods&#39; noise cancellation tech, Apple&#39;s AI and beam-forming mics to help you understand a speaker in a different language. Right now, this is limited to a handful of languages with more being added over time.</p> 
<p>It&#39;s not often you see one of Apple&#39;s best and most recent products on sale for 20 percent off, so if you&#39;re in the market for an upgrade or your first set of AirPods, consider taking advantage of this deal. If you&#39;re looking to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale right now, too, for $119.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brandon Sanderson, a popular author of high-fantasy and science fiction books, has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">signed a deal</a> with Apple TV to adapt his works set in the Cosmere fictional universe into films and TV shows. Sanderson <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/brandon-sanderson-mistborn-movie-celsius-232" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">said</a> last year at Celsius 232, Spain’s annual sci-fi and fantasy convention, that his ultimate dream project is a “really good <em>Mistborn</em> film.” Apple TV is making that come true: Some of the first projects to come out of the deal are feature film adaptations of the Mistborn books and a TV show based on  series. </p><p>According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, Sanderson’s deal with the streaming service is unprecedented, because he will have major creative control over the adaptations. He will write, produce and consult for the projects under development, and he will have the power to sign off on various aspects of the adaptations. That’s a level of control other famous authors such as George R. R. Martin don’t enjoy. In fact, Martin recently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/george-rr-martin-interview-thrones-winds-dragon-knight-1236473519/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">talked about</a> how <em>House of the Dragon’s</em> showrunner, Ryan Condal, has stopped taking his notes and suggestions into account. </p><p>Sanderson’s Cosmere universe encompasses dozens of books set in various but interconnected worlds and timelines. They’re all bound by a single creation myth, which explains where the universe’s different types of magic come from. Apple TV has yet to announce timelines and release dates for the projects based on Sanderson’s work, but The Stormlight Archive TV adaptation already has a producer (Blue Marble) attached to it. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-signs-tv-and-movie-deal-for-brandon-sandersons-fantasy-books-130000797.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been household technology for a while now, but there&#39;s still a lot of uncertainty around them. This is partly due to the fact that they can conceal online activity that local or national governments deem illegal — up to and including, say, circumventing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ID checks for age verification</a>. Consumers aren&#39;t helped by the sheer amount of duds sold in app stores right next to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best VPNs</a>, especially when they&#39;re <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">purposefully exploiting moments</a> that have people rushing to shore up their online anonymity. If you&#39;ve almost decided to start using a VPN, you may be wondering if the services you&#39;re looking at are actually safe.</p><p>Unfortunately, the answer is a hard &quot;it depends.&quot; VPNs are technology that can work well or poorly, just like they can be used for good or evil. There&#39;s nothing intrinsically dangerous about using a VPN — whether or not one is safe comes down to who built it and how they&#39;re running it. The good news is that there are easy ways to tell whether you’re using one of the good ones.</p><p>The question &quot;Are VPNs really safe?&quot; can also mean something else — &quot;Is using a VPN enough to keep me safe online?&quot; I&#39;ll get into that too, but to spoil the ending: VPNs are important security tools, but they aren&#39;t enough to protect against all digital threats by themselves. Also, to be clear, I&#39;m talking here about commercial VPNs like Proton VPN and ExpressVPN, not commercial VPNs like NordLayer or Cisco AnyConnect.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-vpn-unsafe"><strong>What makes a VPN unsafe?</strong></h2><p>There are two main things that can make me call a VPN unsafe: negligence and malice. A negligent VPN doesn&#39;t protect against the dangers it&#39;s supposed to ward off, leaving you more exposed than if you weren&#39;t using a VPN at all. A malicious VPN is designed to make you less safe so the people behind it can profit.</p><p>Some ways a negligent VPN might endanger its users:</p><ul><li><p>Using outdated protocols with cracked encryption, like PPTP, or homebrewed protocols with insufficient security. A weakly secured protocol might expose your search activity.</p></li><li><p>Allowing leaks by using public DNS servers rather than setting up their own system to resolve requests. This risks revealing what websites the VPN&#39;s users are visiting.</p></li><li><p>Leaking the user&#39;s real location by failing to block or properly manage IPv6.</p></li><li><p>Leaving its servers in the hands of unvetted third parties, who might let them get hacked.</p></li><li><p>Failing to include a kill switch, which puts users at risk of connecting to false servers.</p></li></ul><p>Some ways a VPN can be malicious:</p><ul><li><p>Making its money from in-app ads, especially if those ads contain trackers.</p></li><li><p>Harvesting the user&#39;s residential IP address and selling it as a proxy.</p></li><li><p>Tracking the user&#39;s activity and selling it to advertisers.</p></li><li><p>Planting malware on the user&#39;s device.</p></li></ul><p>I want to stress again that none of these risks are inherent to how a VPN works. VPNs aren&#39;t required to be dangerous in any way. There are plenty of good ones, which makes it all the more important to pick the bad ones out of the lineup. In the next section, I&#39;ll discuss how to do that.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-tell-if-a-vpn-is-safe"><strong>How to tell if a VPN is safe</strong></h2><p>The process of checking up on a VPN starts before you buy it. Before you consider downloading any VPN app, do your research and learn as much as you can. Read review sites like Engadget, but also try to get reports from regular users on social media and app stores. Be suspicious of five-star reviews that are light on specifics — the more positive reviews from actual users, the better.</p><p>While researching, look for any cases in which the VPN failed in its mission to protect customers. Did it ever turn information over to police, despite having a no-logs policy? Were any of its servers ever breached by hackers in ways that put other users in danger? Is it cagey about key information, like where it&#39;s based or who its parent company is?</p><p>You can also close-read the VPN&#39;s privacy policy, like I do in my VPN reviews. A privacy policy is a legal document that can invite lawsuits if the provider ignores it outright, so most companies prefer to plant vague loopholes instead. Read the policy and decide for yourself if it makes any unacceptable exceptions to &quot;no logs ever.&quot;</p><p>If the answer to all those questions is no, your next step is to download the VPN and test it. Every worthwhile VPN has a guaranteed refund within a certain period, so you can use that time to test the factors below. If you like the results, you can subscribe for longer; if not, you can cancel and get your money back. Here&#39;s what to look for during the refund period:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check which VPN protocols are available. </strong>The best expert-verified protocols are OpenVPN, IKEv2 and WireGuard. If the VPN uses a protocol other than these three, make sure it&#39;s using an unbreakable encryption cipher like AES-256 or ChaCha20.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test for leaks. </strong>You can run a simple leak test using a website like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a></a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://whatismyipaddress.com" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">whatismyipaddress.com</a></a>. Just check your normal IP address, connect to a VPN server, then check again. If the IP address you see is the same as before, the VPN is leaking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find the kill switch.</strong> A kill switch prevents you from accessing the internet while you&#39;re not connected to its associated VPN. This is critical to prevent certain types of hack that rely on fake servers to work. Most top VPNs have a kill switch or a similar feature with a different name (such as Windscribe&#39;s Firewall).</p></li><li><p><strong>See if the apps are open-source. </strong>A VPN making its services available for viewing on Github states powerfully that it has nothing to hide. Anonymity is an inalienable right for individuals, but VPN apps aren&#39;t people — the more transparent the code, the better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test its other security features. </strong>If the VPN has a blocker for ads, malware or trackers, see if it prevents banner ads from loading. Try connecting to a test malware site like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://www.ianfette.org" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">www.ianfette.org</a></a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://httpforever.com" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">httpforever.com</a></a> and check if the VPN blocks it.</p></li></ul><p>There&#39;s one more factor that generally denotes a safe VPN: paid subscriptions. I&#39;m not going to claim that all free VPNs are dangerous, but if a service claims to be always free with no need whatsoever to pay, you have to ask how it makes money. VPNs that don&#39;t charge for subscriptions usually turn their users into the product, selling their data to advertisers or for use as residential proxies.</p><h2 id="jump-link-is-a-vpn-enough-to-keep-you-safe-online"><strong>Is a VPN enough to keep you safe online?</strong></h2><p>Another way in which VPNs aren&#39;t totally safe is that they aren&#39;t, by themselves, a total solution for cybersecurity. A VPN does one specific task: it replaces your IP address with an anonymous server and encrypts communication with that server so your real device can&#39;t be seen. This means you won&#39;t reveal your identity or location in the normal course of using the internet.</p><p>However, if you reveal information another way, then all bets are off. If you click a sketchy link that downloads malware onto your computer, that malware doesn&#39;t care that your IP address is concealed — it&#39;s already where it needs to be. Similarly, if you leak critical information in a social post, or privately give it up to a phishing scammer, a VPN won&#39;t help.</p><p>I put together a list of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">12 cybersecurity habits</a> that&#39;ll keep you safe from nearly all threats online. Getting a VPN is one of them, but there are 11 others, including strengthening your passwords, immediately installing updates and conditioning yourself to spot social engineering hacks. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking you&#39;re untouchable just because you use a VPN.</p><h2 id="jump-link-the-safest-vpns"><strong>The safest VPNs</strong></h2><p>It can be a lot of work to figure out whether a VPN is safe and trustworthy.

Often, a VPN responding correctly to a security breach looks better than one which has never been attacked at all — sometimes strength can only be known in adversity.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-really-safe-the-security-factors-to-consider-before-using-one-130000539.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DJI just revealed the RS 5 camera gimbal, a new entry in its long-standing Ronan Series. The RS 5 is lightweight, at around three pounds, with a maximum payload of nearly seven pounds.</p>
<p>This gimbal offers what DJI calls &quot;enhanced intelligent subject tracking.&quot; The tracking <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-mobile-8-gimbal-adds-pet-tracking-and-apple-dockkit-support-120032512.html"><ins>was already impressive</ins></a> with some of the company&#39;s older offerings, so any improvement will be icing on the cake. A new tracking module lets videographers frame live footage and follow subjects directly from an included touchscreen, all without having to fiddle with the actual camera.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/37c9f9e0-fc67-11f0-a757-5b09356c909a" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/37c9f9e0-fc67-11f0-a757-5b09356c909a" style="height:850px;width:1264px;" alt="A gimbal." data-uuid="5410bf01-e1b8-35a0-b8cb-158e108af06b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure>
<p>The tracking module also offers the ability to follow more than people. It can track pets, vehicles or just about any other object. It can also help maintain a locked focus on a human subject up to 10 meters away.</p>
<p>The RS 5 includes the company&#39;s latest stabilization algorithm, which DJI says lets videographers &quot;effortlessly achieve complicated camera movements, such as surround shots, reverse tracking or single-person fixed-camera tracking.&quot; It&#39;s also great for when the cameraperson is capturing footage while walking or running.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been designed to carry a wide range of mainstream mirrorless cameras and lens combinations and can switch to vertical shooting without additional accessories. There&#39;s a nifty little briefcase handle for capturing footage from above or below.</p>
<p>The RS 5 delivers up to 14 hours of use per charge and can be fully charged in just an hour. Video shoots can take forever, so this is a welcome bit of news. For true marathons, there&#39;s a separate enhanced battery grip accessory that extends the runtime to 30 hours.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/63fcfa80-fc67-11f0-99d6-62ecb7354700" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/63fcfa80-fc67-11f0-99d6-62ecb7354700" style="height:950px;width:1266px;" alt="Two cars and a gimbal. " data-uuid="98a46baa-39bb-3fec-8fb8-23a2b80b8f27"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure>
<p>The standard DJI RS 5 includes the gimbal, a quick-open tripod, quick-release plates, a regular battery grip and some other useful accessories. That pack costs around $680. The combo pack includes all of the above, plus the enhanced tracking module, a carrying case and an electronic briefcase handle. That costs around $859.</p>
<p>Now for the bad news. We don&#39;t have a US release date or even any information as to if it will be available here. Engadget has reached out to DJI for more information. The company&#39;s drones were <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/why-dji-drones-might-be-banned-in-the-us-170030273.html"><ins>recently banned from being imported to the US</ins></a>. This only impacts newly-released models and shouldn&#39;t impact gimbals or anything like that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-launches-the-lightweight-rs-5-camera-gimbal-for-video-creators-120056173.html?src=rss]]></description>

It makes the covers more fun, and readers of comics and graphic novels will appreciate the added hues (though they may be happier with an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablet</a> for better image detail). Color is just one factor to consider when picking out the best ereader. The lights, screen quality, housing and buttons make a difference too. Then there’s the software: Do you want to stay in the Kindle ecosystem or get a device that can handle lots of apps? We tested more than a dozen ereaders to come up with our recommendations. This guide also points out ways to get the most out of your new e-book companion once you pick your favorite.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader">What to look for in an ereader</h2> 
<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Color ereaders add a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> 
<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.</p> 
<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading-features"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> 
<p>With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> 
<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.</p> 
<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-other-features"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> 
<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> 
<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you&#39;ll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> 
<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p>

<p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.</p>

<p>Buying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p>

Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files.

Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p>

<p>To read library books on a <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> 
<p>For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox&#39;s Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> 
<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders">How we test ereaders</h2> 
<p>When putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p> 
<p>Over the course of the past three years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-amazon-kindle-colorsoft">Amazon Kindle Colorsoft</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html">Amazon’s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> 
<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: &quot;A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.&quot;</p> 
<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.</p>

After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.</p> 
<p>I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There&#39;s a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be <a data-i13n="cpos:41;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">better served by an E Ink tablet</a>, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-ereader-faqs">Ereader FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-an-ereader-and-an-e-ink-reader"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?</strong></h3> 
<p>Really, they are the same thing. <a data-i13n="cpos:42;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/about?company">E Ink</a> is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.</p> 
<p>But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink <em>tablets</em>. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to <a data-i13n="cpos:43;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">helping you pick out an E Ink tablet</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-there-ads-on-my-ereader"><strong>Are there ads on my ereader?</strong></h3> 
<p>The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereader-has-the-longest-battery-life"><strong>Which ereader has the longest battery life?</strong></h3> 
<p>Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> 
<p>Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> 
<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> 
<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle-only+books&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2I_bm9kZT0xOTI3MTcwNjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYj9ub2RlPTE5MjcxNzA2MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVfQtILpNl4j-jhmpgChMRVcssUkpbLilOSDy4FrIhd1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fnode%3D19271706011" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19271706011">Kindle-only books</a> is much larger <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Kobo;elmt:;cpos:45;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;linkText=than+Kobo%E2%80%99s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2tvYm9vcmlnaW5hbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vdXMvZW4vcC9rb2Jvb3JpZ2luYWxzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATjuNnZvRXlMJC6dkHZ86gdxoVLQ4PXMnCI_YfD7Ivq4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkobooriginals" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/kobooriginals">than Kobo’s</a>.

<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereader-is-best-for-library-books"><strong>Which ereader is best for library books?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p>

Specs can blur together fast, but a few basics still matter, like processing power, battery life and whether you’re getting enough storage for the long haul. For many people, that means looking for something that lands in the sweet spot with modern ports, a solid display and at least a 512GB SSD so you’re not juggling external drives a month after you bring your new laptop home.<br><br>Out of all of the notebooks we&#39;ve tested and reviewed recently, we consider <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DZDC3WW5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Apple%27s+13-inch+MacBook+Air+M4&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLTIwMjUtTWFjQm9vay0xMy1pbmNoLUxhcHRvcC9kcC9CMERaREMzV1c1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5YTdmYjA4LWI0Y2ItMzU5OC04OTBjLTZmNmQ4NzgzMzliMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS0yMDI1LU1hY0Jvb2stMTMtaW5jaC1MYXB0b3AvZHAvQjBEWkRDM1dXNSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcl4wbTMYWMLH22Dkn4z5vim5MgBzKRpGQmIpvJqqtUY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0DZDC3WW5" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5?th=1">Apple&#39;s 13-inch MacBook Air M4</a> to be the best laptop for most people, and this is still the case for our top picks to start off the new year. It&#39;s powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last over 18hours (depending on what you&#39;re doing, of course). The MacBook Air M4 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we&#39;ve reviewed, and it&#39;s dead silent, thanks to a fanless design.<br><br>Of course, not everyone wants a MacBook, and there are excellent <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-windows-laptop-130018256.html">Windows laptops</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebooks</a> out there, too. Windows systems offer a range of configurations, from budget to high-end UHD screens with stunning IPS panels that boast high nits for vivid brightness. Chromebooks, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and are great for users who mostly work online. Whether you need a powerhouse for creative work, a compact system for note-taking, or a laptop that can handle family movie night, there’s something for everyone in today’s laptop market.</p>

<p>Engadget has been <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-20/">reviewing laptops for two decades</a>, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-we-test-laptops-203909669.html">testing</a> their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft&#39;s Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP&#39;s Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-operating-system-apple-windows-or-chrome-os">Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS</h3> 
<p>There&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it&#39;s another story if you&#39;ve become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an Apple-loyalist, there aren&#39;t many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">MacBooks</a>, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we&#39;ve ever seen. They&#39;re incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you&#39;re used to iOS and iPadOS.</p> 
<p>That brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple&#39;s other platforms. You can&#39;t respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+Phone+Link+app&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvc3luYy1hY3Jvc3MteW91ci1kZXZpY2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvd2luZG93cy9zeW5jLWFjcm9zcy15b3VyLWRldmljZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf6ecThFK8UkL1n9MqlvWg-rE0x3ymgn2Y8PiFuAQZb1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fsync-across-your-devices" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/sync-across-your-devices">Microsoft&#39;s Phone Link app</a> lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone&#39;s photos.</p> 
<p>If cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.</p> 
<p>As for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.</p> 
<p>And what about ChromeOS? <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebooks</a> are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they&#39;re not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren&#39;t many apps or games that work offline, and they also don&#39;t work with powerful software suites like Adobe&#39;s (you can use the stripped-down <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/02/adobe-express-photoshop-google-chromebook-plus">Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools</a>, though).</p> 
<p>Chromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they&#39;re popular in schools because they&#39;re cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.</p> 
<p>If, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-chromebook-plus-initiative-pushes-higher-spec-standards-and-handy-software-tools-130055583.html">Chromebook Plus models</a> to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">company’s online AI features</a>, like AI image generation and photo processing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you&#39;re looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you&#39;re willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). For entry-level systems, you’ll often have to decide whether you’d rather prioritize processing power or storage, especially if 512GB SSD upgrades bump the price. Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.</p> 
<p>I’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">the best budget laptops</a> that you can check out as well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-laptop-size-and-weight">Laptop size and weight</h3> 
<p>So how portable do you want your laptop to be? That&#39;s the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it&#39;s enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).</p> 
<p>If you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.</p> 
<p>For artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you&#39;d expect, you&#39;ll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.</p> 
<p>You can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming systems</a> or souped-up workstations. They&#39;re not meant for mere computing mortals.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports-and-connectivity">Ports and connectivity</h3> 
<p>These days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple&#39;s MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you&#39;ll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft&#39;s Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-spectre-x360-14-review-2024-keeping-the-2-in-1-laptop-dream-alive-140045823.html">HP&#39;s Spectre x360 14</a>, as well as many models from ASUS.</p> 
<p>For gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re a fan of wired headphones, it&#39;s worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that&#39;s a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it&#39;s still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.</p> 
<p>Most laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">routers</a> and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn&#39;t made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there <em>are</em> notebooks like the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">Surface Pro 9</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-180044021.html">Samsung Galaxy Book</a> models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life"><strong>Battery life</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop&#39;s battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.</p> 
<p>If battery life is your absolute priority, I&#39;d strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple&#39;s M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you&#39;d expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-refresh-rate"><strong>Refresh rate</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop&#39;s refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we&#39;re seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)</p> 
<p>While high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we&#39;re seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-and-gpu">CPU and GPU</h3> 
<p>If you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs so you’re not short on processing power a year from now. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel&#39;s older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don&#39;t have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you&#39;re looking at used systems.</p> 
<p>You&#39;ll also see AMD&#39;s Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you&#39;ll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD&#39;s main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel&#39;s Arc hardware (though those are getting better).</p> 
<p>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-rebuilt-windows-11-around-ai-and-arm-chips-173152776.html">rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture</a>, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.</p> 
<p>As for Apple&#39;s laptops, you&#39;ll be choosing between the M4 Pro, M4 Max and M5, each of which is progressively more powerful.</p> 
<p>On the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop&#39;s display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD&#39;s chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 40-series hardware or AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.</p> 
<p>Apple&#39;s M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD&#39;s lower-end dedicated GPUs. That&#39;s quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it&#39;s another reason we highly recommend Apple&#39;s notebooks.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ai-pcs-npus-and-copilot"><strong>AI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+</strong></h3> 
<p>Simply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).</p> 
<p>We were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html">AMD announced</a> in 2023. Intel unveiled its <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">&quot;Core Ultra&quot; CPUs</a> in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-8040-chips-remind-intel-its-falling-behind-in-ai-pcs-200043544.html">Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips</a> that month (and it couldn&#39;t help but say they were faster than Intel&#39;s new hardware). But in May, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html">Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative</a>, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.</p> 
<p>Copilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-postpones-the-launch-of-its-controversial-recall-ai-feature-031554596.html">Recall</a>, which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-paint-is-getting-an-ai-powered-image-generator-that-responds-to-your-text-prompts-and-doodles-190653716.html">Cocreator in Paint</a>, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.</p> 
<p>If you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.</p> 
<p>At the time of this post, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">Chromebook Plus notebooks</a> can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-laptops-we-tested">Other laptops we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition">Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html">ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition</a> is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.</p> 
<p>While the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14’s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. It’s mushier than we’d like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. You’ll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.</p> 
<p>Where the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-14-oled">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</h3> 
<p>Aside from its lovely OLED screen, the <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-14-oled-review-ai-pc-143054247.html">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</a> doesn&#39;t stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I&#39;d recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-razer-blade-14">Razer Blade 14</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-2024-review-a-portable-but-pricey-powerhouse-specs-price-160020891.html">Razer Blade</a> has almost everything you&#39;d want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it&#39;s far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it&#39;s certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-framework-laptop-16">Framework Laptop 16</h3>

<h2 id="jump-link-laptop-faqs">Laptop FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-average-battery-life-of-a-laptop-per-charge">What is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?</h3> 
<p>It’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-ram-do-i-really-need">How much RAM do I really need?</h3> 
<p>The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you <em>could</em> use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start.</p> 
<p>If you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-storage-capacity-for-a-laptop">What is the best storage capacity for a laptop?</h3> 
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB <a data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ssds-140014262.html">SSDs</a> (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.</p> 
<p>If you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.</p> 
<p>We recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It&#39;s also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-a-good-price-range-for-a-decent-laptop-in-2026">What&#39;s a good price range for a decent laptop in 2026?</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you&#39;ll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-macos-and-windows-which-is-better">What’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?</h3> 
<p>Simply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple&#39;s notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You&#39;ll also find Chromebooks running Google&#39;s ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.</p> 
<p>Debating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the &#39;80s, so we won&#39;t be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.</p> 
<p>But if you care more about playing the newest games, you&#39;ll want to have a Windows system. If you&#39;re more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you&#39;re running an iPhone).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-laptop-brands">What are the best laptop brands?</h3> 
<p>There is no single &quot;best&quot; laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we&#39;re generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option that’s the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, <a data-i13n="cpos:40;pos:1" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52019024">dominate laptop sales worldwide</a>. We&#39;d avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don&#39;t have a major presence in the US.</p>

You can still buy the vehicles as long as there are units to be sold, and Tesla promises to support them for as long as people have them. Once they’re gone, though, they’re gone for good, because Tesla is converting their production space in the company’s Fremont factory into a space for the manufacturing of Optimus humanoid robots.</p><p>Model S is Tesla’s second vehicle and has been in production since 2012, while the Model X SUV has been in production since 2015. Their shine has faded over the years, however, and the newer Model 3 and Y now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-says-it-delivered-a-record-18-million-evs-in-2023-082906995.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">make up the bulk</a> of the company’s sales. For the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">entirety of 2025,</a> for instance, Tesla delivered 1,585,279 Model 3 and Y vehicles but only sold 418,227 Model S and X units. The company also had to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-halts-model-s-and-x-sales-in-china-due-to-tariffs-185752814.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">stop selling</a> Model S and X in China in mid-2025, because they were being imported from the US and were subject to China’s tariffs that were put in place in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported goods. </p><p>In the call, Musk said that Tesla’s long-term goal is to be able to manufacture 1 million Optimus robots in the current Model S and X production space. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland a few days ago, the CEO announced that Tesla will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-just-told-davos-that-tesla-will-sell-humanoid-robots-next-year-really-he-swears-192515568.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">start selling Optimus</a> to the public by the end of next year. Musk has big plans for Optimus and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/elon-musk-says-tesla-owners-can-text-and-drive-very-soon-042454805.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">once said</a> that it’s bound to become the “biggest product of all time,” bigger than cellphones, “bigger than anything.” But the humanoid robot has been failing to live up to the hype during demonstrations, and Musk is known for his overly optimistic timelines. </p><p>The company’s earnings report has also revealed that Tesla invested $2 billion in Musk’s other company, xAI. Tesla’s shareholders notably <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/tesla-shareholders-sue-musk-for-starting-competing-ai-company/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">sued Musk in 2024</a> for starting xAI, which they argued is a direct competition to the automaker. The CEO has been claiming for years, after all, that Tesla is an AI company and not just an EV-maker.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg says there&#39;s an end in sight to Reality Labs&#39; years of multibillion-dollar losses following the company&#39;s layoffs to the metaverse division earlier this year. The CEO said he expects to &quot;gradually reduce&quot; how much money the company is losing as it doubles down on AI glasses and shifts away from virtual reality.</p><p>Speaking during Meta&#39;s fourth-quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg was clear that the changes won&#39;t happen soon, but sounded optimistic about the division that lost more than $19 billion in 2025 alone. &quot;For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.&quot;</p><p>The company cut more than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">1,000 employees</a> from Reality Labs earlier this month, shut down <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-has-closed-three-vr-studios-as-part-of-its-metaverse-cuts-202720670.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">three VR studios</a> and announced plans <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-closing-down-its-vr-meeting-rooms-as-part-of-its-wider-cull-140000422.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to retire</a> its app for VR meetings. Meta has also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">paused</a> plans for third-party Horizon OS headsets. Instead, Meta is doubling down on its smart glasses and and wearables business, which tie in more neatly to Zuckerberg&#39;s vision for creating AI &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">superintelligence</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>During the call, Zuckerberg noted that sales of Meta&#39;s smart glasses &quot;more than tripled&quot; in 2025, and hinted at bigger plans for AR glasses. &quot;They [AI glasses] are going to be able to see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you and help you as you go about your day and even show you information or generate custom UI right there in your vision,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zuckerberg has spent the last few years laying the groundwork <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-metaverse-is-getting-an-ai-makeover-194004996.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">for pivoting</a> Meta&#39;s metaverse work into AI.  He offered one example if what the means for Meta’s Horizon app.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You can imagine … people being able to easily, through a prompt, create a world or create a game, and be able to share that with people who they care about. And you see it in your feed, and you can jump right into it, and you can engage in it. And there are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that. And Horizon, I think fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that. </p><p>“But there&#39;s definitely a version of the future where, you know, any video that you see, you can, like, tap on and jump into it and, like, engage and kind of like, experience it in a more meaningful way. And I think that the investments that we&#39;ve done in both a lot of the virtual reality software and Horizon … are actually going to pair well with these AI advances to be able to bring some of those experiences to hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>One thing Zuckerberg didn’t mention, though: the word “metaverse.”</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Patreon creators will need to make some changes soon, thanks to Apple. On Wednesday, Patreon said Apple has renewed its requirement that all Patreon creators must move to subscription billing. The deadline to do so is November 1, 2026.</p><p>Patreon&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post</a> announcing the change made it clear that it had no other choice. &quot;We strongly disagree with this decision,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months.&quot;</p><p>Up to this point, Patreon’s billing model has operated in a gray area, allowing its creators to charge fans outside the App Store without paying Apple’s fees. When the issue first surfaced, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">described</a> it as stemming from how paid content was accessed (only some creators offered content that could be consumed in-app). On Wednesday, a Patreon representative described the gray area as being “because Apple’s In-App Purchase system doesn’t support some of Patreon’s longstanding billing models.”</p><p>But now Apple has reimposed its subscription mandate, eliminating the gray area. &quot;We know that Apple is serious about enforcing this mandate,&quot; Patreon wrote. &quot;Late last year, they blocked a Patreon app update and made it clear that in order to remain in the App Store, we have to comply with their billing requirement. Because millions of fans use iOS as their primary way to access Patreon and connect with creators, having our app blocked — or not available in the App Store at all — isn&#39;t an option.&quot;</p><p>Patreon’s &quot;whiplash&quot; description isn&#39;t hyperbole. Apple first announced the mandate in 2024. At that time, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="slk:deadline;cpos:3;pos:1">deadline</a> for all Patreon creators to make the switch was set to November 2025 — one that Patreon grudgingly accepted. But according to the company, Apple told it last May that the original 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. Now, it appears to have reversed that again.</p><p>If there&#39;s a silver lining, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/apple-tells-patreon-to-move-creators-to-in-app-purchase-for-subscriptions-by-november/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">notes</a> that only 4 percent of Patreon creators are using the affected (legacy) billing models. And fans can still bypass Apple&#39;s fees on iOS by joining via their iPhone&#39;s web browser. Patreon has much more detail for creators in its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">announcement post</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/536d8711-5d36-42fa-8429-bd459832b212" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/536d8711-5d36-42fa-8429-bd459832b212" style="height:3290px;width:4934px;" alt="DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 21: U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks to Apple CEO Tim Cook (L) as he attends a reception for business leaders at the&nbsp;World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting on January 21, 2026 in Davos, Switzerland.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope have found a galaxy that is offering new data about the early stages of the universe&#39;s existence. The latest <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esawebb.org/news/weic2603/?lang" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">discovery</a> shared by astronomers is about a bright galaxy dubbed MoM-z14. According to the team, this galaxy existed 280 million years after the Big Bang.&nbsp;</p><p>The sounds like a long time, but in the context of the universe&#39;s estimated 13.8 billion years of existence, that&#39;s actually one of the closest examples astronomers have found to the Big Bang&#39;s occurrence. As a result, MoM-z14 can offer some insights and some surprises about what the early stages of the universe entailed.</p><p>&quot;With Webb, we are able to see farther than humans ever have before, and it looks nothing like what we predicted, which is both challenging and exciting,&quot; lead author Rohan Naidu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology said. The findings about this galaxy were published in the <em>Open Journal of Astrophysics</em>.</p><p>The scientists were able to date MoM-z14 with Webb&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nirspec/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> instrument, analyzing how light from the galaxy changed wavelengths as it traveled to reach the telescope. One of the initial questions sparked by this bright galaxy centers on the presence of nitrogen. Some early galaxies, including MoM-z14, have revealed higher nitrogen concentrations than scientists had projected was possible. Another topic of interest is about reionization, or the process of stars producing enough light or energy to permeate the dense hydrogen fog that existed in the early universe.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s an incredibly exciting time, with Webb revealing the early Universe like never before and showing us how much there still is to discover” said Pennsylvania State University graduate student and team member Yijia Li.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-share-new-insights-about-the-early-universe-via-the-webb-space-telescope-213311848.html?src=rss]]></description>

They are <em>Undisputed</em>, <em>Subnautica: Below Zero, Ultros</em> and <em>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</em>. If you have a PS Plus subscription on any tier, you can claim these starting on February 3. After claiming them, these games will stay in your library as long as your PS Plus plan remains active.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Undisputed</em> (PS5) is a 2024 boxing game with dozens of licensed fighters across several weight classes. They include legendary figures like Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson as well as modern greats including Canelo Alvarez and Oleksandr Usyk.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/subnautica-below-zero-full-release-may-170018659.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em></a> (PS4 and PS5) is a spin-off from adventure survival game <em>Subnautica</em>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Music hardware and software manufacturer Native Instruments has entered into preliminary insolvency proceedings, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://cdm.link/ni-insolvency/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Create Digital Music</ins></em></a>. This is the company behind iconic software like Massive, Traktor and Kontakt and hardware like Maschine+. Native Instruments also owns the brands iZotope, Brainworx and Plugin Alliance.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have many specifics as to what this entails and what the future of the company will look like. We do know that an administrator has been appointed to handle restructuring and, potentially, to sell off existing assets. Native Instruments employs hundreds of people and their fates also remain uncertain.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A private equity firm called Francisco Partners owns a majority stake in the company. It also owns majority stakes in entities like GoodRX and Verifone, among others. This isn&#39;t the first time Native Instruments has been forced into major restructuring. The company experienced plenty of layoffs and uncertainty <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://djtechtools.com/2019/09/03/shakeups-layoffs-whats-happening-at-native-instruments/"><ins>between 2019 and 2020</ins></a> before being purchased by private equity.</p>
<p>Again, we have no idea how this will shake out. It&#39;s possible that new investors will jump on board and it goes back to business as usual. It&#39;s also possible everything will be scrapped for parts and sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<div id="4228f96c81d74b0e81b38b14f5daa828"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Plugin Alliance, with entities in the US and Germany, says there&#39;s no immediate impact of the NI insolvency on them. <a href="https://t.co/u6smg1X0t4">https://t.co/u6smg1X0t4</a> <a href="https://t.co/ok7BRwo3BU">pic.twitter.com/ok7BRwo3BU</a></p>— cdmblogs (@cdmblogs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdmblogs/status/2016499892064014356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote>

<p>We do know that subsidiary Plugin Alliance seems to be unaffected. It issued a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.gearnews.com/native-instruments-insolvency/">statement on Facebook</a> saying that it isn&#39;t involved with the proceedings and that operations will continue as normal. This means new plugins will be released, along with updates for current software.</p>
<p>Everything else is still up in the air. This is troubling for those who have heavily invested in the company&#39;s ecosystem of products. I&#39;m one of them. Any hope I had for a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/maschine-plus-native-instruments-virtual-instruments-groovebox-155725975.html"><ins>hardware refresh of the Maschine+</ins></a> just went out the window.</p>

<p>If the company&#39;s robust line of software goes up for sale, Akai is likely the best bet.

Starting today, a host of new features are rolling out for the browser, with more to come over the next few months.&nbsp;</p><p>The first of the new features is a sidebar. Available to all <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-in-chrome-no-longer-requires-a-subscription-170045611.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Gemini in Chrome users</a>, the interface allows you to chat with Gemini and keep a conversation going across multiple tabs. Google suggests the sidebar is useful for multitaskers.&nbsp;&quot;Our testers have been using it for all sorts of things: comparing options across too-many-tabs, summarizing product reviews across different sites, and helping find time for events in even the most chaotic of calendars,&quot; the company writes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_Chrome_Nano_Banana_Room_Design_%281%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_Chrome_Nano_Banana_Room_Design_%281%29.gif" style="height:1150px;width:2000px;" alt="Now you can access Nano Banana, Google&#39;s in-house image generator, directly from Chrome. No need to go to the Gemini app." data-uuid="47784ede-fc6d-426d-a0e6-a10aaf5c7ad4"/><figcaption>Now you can access Nano Banana, Google&#39;s in-house image generator, directly from Chrome. No need to go to the Gemini app.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The sidebar is also where you access the second new feature Google is adding to Chrome. Following its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">successful rollout within the Gemini app</a>, Nano Banana, Google&#39;s in-house image generator, is available directly inside of the browser. With the addition, you won&#39;t need to open a new tab when you want Gemini to make you an AI image. You also won&#39;t need to download and upload a file when you want Gemini to edit an existing image for you. Instead, you can complete both of those tasks from any of your open tabs, thanks to the new sidebar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward, Google plans to bring Personal Intelligence, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-pull-context-the-rest-of-your-google-apps-if-you-let-it-160039468.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">debuted inside of the Gemini app at the start of January</a>, to Chrome in the coming months. Once the feature arrives, it will allow the browser to remember past conversations you&#39;ve had with Gemini. In turn, Google says this will lead to a more personalized Chrome. &quot;Personal Intelligence in Chrome transforms the browsing experience from a general purpose tool into a trusted partner that understands you and provides relevant, proactive, and context-aware assistance,&quot; the company said. </p><p>In the meantime, Gemini in Chrome already supports Google&#39;s Connected Apps feature, which allows the assistant to pull information from the company&#39;s other services, including Gmail and Calendar. During a press briefing, a Google employee demoed this feature by asking Gemini to pull up the dates of when their children would be on March break. Without telling the assistant where to look, Gemini sourced the correct time frame from the employee&#39;s email inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_apartment_hunting_with_Redfin_%281%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_apartment_hunting_with_Redfin_%281%29.gif" style="height:650px;width:1000px;" alt="A new sidebar interface allows Chrome users to access Gemini from any of their open tabs." data-uuid="62c08ab8-231e-417f-990c-b07e5ec8161e"/><figcaption>A new sidebar interface allows Chrome users to access Gemini from any of their open tabs.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Last but not least, Google is previewing a new auto browse feature inside of Chrome. In the demo the company showed, an employee asked Gemini to find and buy them the same winter jacket they bought a few seasons ago. The assistant first drafted a plan outlining how best to tackle the request. It reasoned the best place to start was with a search of the employee&#39;s email inbox to determine the correct model and size of jacket.&nbsp;It then went shopping. </p><p>While Gemini was working on this task, the employee was free to continue browsing in Chrome. At several points in the process, the assistant would stop before continuing to obtain the employee&#39;s permission to move forward. For instance, it paused when it needed  login credentials, and again when it needed a credit card number to complete the purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>Judging from the demo, it will probably take you less time to do your online shopping and other browser tasks on your own. Google suggests the feature will appeal to those who are creatures of habit. Say you often order the same produce from a grocery delivery service every week, Gemini can automate the ordering. Plus, the feature is in preview, so early testers probably won&#39;t be too put off by Gemini&#39;s slow pace. In any case, Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US can try auto browse starting today. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-brings-its-nano-banana-image-generator-to-chrome-180000104.html?src=rss]]></description>

After the floundering publisher floated even more layoffs this week, workers at its Paris headquarters said, &quot;Enough is enough.&quot; They&#39;re now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-worker-unions-reportedly-vote-to-strike-as-publisher-proposes-200-voluntary-redundancies" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">calling</a> for a three-day strike.</p><p>Unions representing Ubisoft employees plan to strike from February 10 to 12. &quot;With management being stubbornly entrenched in its authoritarian ways, we are calling Ubisoft employees across France to join this strike, along with the five unions present within the company,&quot; The Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (Video Game Worker&#39;s Union) wrote in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mdiakvmbbd26" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">statement</a>.</p><p>The strike follows a series of heavy-handed cost-cutting moves at Ubisoft. It recently shut down its Halifax studio just <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">16 days after employees unionized</a>. Last week, it closed its Stockholm studio and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">announced additional restructuring efforts</a> worldwide.

Under French labor law, the company would organize the cuts through the nation&#39;s Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process.

(The company had previously agreed to two work-from-home days per week.) Although Ubisoft framed the mandate as being about efficiency and collaboration, it&#39;s easy to view this as a cudgel to further reduce its headcount. One Ubisoft developer, who hinted as much while voicing his opposition to the mandate on LinkedIn, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-punishes-developer-union-strike-return-to-office-2000663771" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">said</a> he was suspended without pay for three days as a punitive measure.</p><p>The workers&#39; union saw all of this and decided it was time to act. &quot;We&#39;re calling for a HALT to management&#39;s obsession with penny-pinching and worsening our working conditions,&quot; the Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo wrote. &quot;It&#39;s time for a real accountability from company executives, starting from the top! Without the workers, and generous public funding, Ubisoft would never have been able to grow this much. WE are Ubisoft, and WE are shutting it down February 10th to 12th!&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-173241918.html?src=rss]]></description>

Despite its high-achieving free plan, it didn&#39;t quite make my list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best VPNs</a>, largely due to alienating interface choices and swingy download speeds. Its iconoclastic approach to everything from design to pricing to its online knowledge base will likely win some customers for life and turn others off.</p><p>For those in the latter camp, I&#39;ve written up this guide for cancelling Windscribe. Follow the instructions below to stop Windscribe from auto-renewing, cancel third-party subscriptions, delete your account altogether and get a refund.</p><p>The most important thing to know before we start is that Windscribe&#39;s money-back guarantee only lasts seven days — if you paid for a subscription, you have to cancel before then to get a refund. It&#39;s a tighter period than most VPNs, so be ready to decide fast.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-stop-your-windscribe-pro-subscription-renewing"><strong>How to stop your Windscribe Pro subscription renewing</strong></h2><p>To cancel Windscribe Pro, simply stop your payment method from automatically renewing for the next subscription period. Once you&#39;ve done this, you can continue using Windscribe Pro until the end of the current period, then you&#39;ll be downgraded to the free version. Here are the steps to follow.</p><ol><li><p>In your browser, navigate to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://windscribe.com" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">windscribe.com</a></a><strong>.</strong> Click the words <strong>My Account </strong>at the top of the home page.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down to the billing section<strong>.</strong> On the subscription<strong> </strong>line, click the button marked <strong>Cancel Subscription.</strong></p></li><li><p>You&#39;ll be taken to a new page. Enter your password in the <strong>Your Password </strong>field. Below, enter a reason for cancellation (this can be &quot;none&quot; or possibly &quot;suck it,&quot; which Windscribe should approve of).</p></li><li><p>Click the <strong>Cancel Subscriptions </strong>button at the bottom of the page to end automatic renewal on your account.</p></li></ol><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_cancel_subscription.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_cancel_subscription.png" style="height:1786px;width:2032px;" alt="You can reach this page by logging into your account on Windscribe.com." data-uuid="de2a35c0-88f9-4a48-b181-7fedcf374286"/><figcaption>You can reach this page by logging into your account on Windscribe.com.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>If your account also included a static IP subscription, there&#39;s no way to cancel that through the usual dashboard. You&#39;ll have to submit a support request by asking the Garry chatbot, which can be accessed by clicking the icon at the bottom-right corner of any page on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://windscribe.com" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">windscribe.com</a></a>.</p><p>When you subscribe to an app through a third party like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, that same third party also handles cancellations and refunds. Windscribe itself won&#39;t be able to do anything for you here.</p><p>If you subscribed through Google Play on an Android phone, you can cancel by opening the <strong>Google Play Store app</strong> and tapping your <strong>profile icon</strong> at the top-right (a circle with the first letter of your username inside). Tap <strong>Payments &amp; Subscriptions </strong>in the menu that appears, then <strong>subscriptions </strong>on the next page. Find your Windscribe subscription, tap it and click <strong>Cancel Subscription </strong>to end payments.</p><p>If you went through the App Store on an Apple device, open the <strong>Settings app</strong>, then tap on <strong>your name </strong>at the top of the screen. Tap <strong>Subscriptions</strong> and scroll down to your Windscribe subscription. Tap it, then tap <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong>.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-delete-your-windscribe-account"><strong>How to delete your Windscribe account</strong></h2><p>If you&#39;re certain you want to stop using Windscribe and never start up again, you can scrub your presence from its servers by deleting your account. To do this, go to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://windscribe.com" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">windscribe.com</a></a> and click the <strong>My Account </strong>button in the header bar.

Click <strong>Yes </strong>or <strong>No </strong>when asked if you ever question your life choices. Enter your password, write whatever you want as a cancellation reason and check both of the boxes below the text field. The <strong>Delete Account </strong>button should finally be clickable; do it. Once you&#39;ve pulled the trigger, you won&#39;t be able to use the same email address to sign up for another account.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-windscribe"><strong>How to get a refund from Windscribe</strong></h2><p>As I warned above, you can only get a refund from Windscribe for seven days after paying for a subscription. You also cannot get your money back if you&#39;ve used more than 10GB of data since the start of the payment period. Finally, you can only get refunded on the first payment of each subscription — renewals are not eligible.</p><p>If you&#39;re within those limits, you can request your money back by starting a conversation with the Garry chatbot. Click the chatbot icon at the bottom-right of the Windscribe website to start a chat. Be warned that you might have to stand firm through several attempts to fix your complaints before you can actually initiate the refund process.</p><h2 id="jump-link-best-windscribe-alternatives"><strong>Best Windscribe alternatives</strong></h2><p>Windscribe is a VPN with a lot of good points. That said, by the time you&#39;ve waded through a swamp of dick jokes to complete the process, I wouldn&#39;t blame you for feeling validated in your decision to get rid of it.</p><p>There are plenty of good VPNs that can replace Windscribe.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-180602104.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It&#39;s easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it&#39;s all styrofoam under the hood.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>I built this list of the best VPNs <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html">after intensive testing</a> to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can&#39;t go too far wrong. If you&#39;re interested in a service you can use without paying, head over to my list of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html">the best free VPNs</a> — and if you&#39;re willing to pay but want to save money, I keep a list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html">best VPN deals</a> updated weekly.</p> 
<p>For each VPN on this list, I&#39;ve shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I&#39;ll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Editor&#39;s note:</em></strong><em> This list is up-to-date as of January 2026. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors.</em></p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn&#39;t crack our top list above, but we&#39;re summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former&#39;s no-nonsense privacy and the latter&#39;s healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe&#39;s server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We&#39;ve just published a full <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/windscribe-review-despite-the-annoyances-it-has-the-right-idea-120000837.html">Windscribe review</a> that can tell you more.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn&#39;t copy the most important part of Proton VPN&#39;s free plan — the unlimited data. You&#39;re only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn&#39;t enough for regular streaming. It&#39;s also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-private-internet-access"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=Private+Internet+Access&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb2xZhJgbuYJ1Fdt6xW-K50AZouRlBZmdjdZsNQwkI8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h3> 
<p>Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it&#39;s a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won&#39;t see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.</p> 
<p>PIA&#39;s apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html">PIA VPN review</a>.</p> 
<p>The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA&#39;s apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren&#39;t directly reflected in the speed tests. It&#39;s also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it&#39;s heavily bulked out by virtual locations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it&#39;s far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:VyprVPN;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1ac8eebf-61d7-4584-9f21-7053ac17ead1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=VyprVPN&amp;linkText=VyprVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52eXBydnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudnlwcnZwbi5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATWG0NqEJnfLwacpOW9Xap1dcDWgI9JL41k8O7ZSdLor&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vyprvpn.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn&#39;t crack the VPN encryption itself). It&#39;s also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn&#39;t make the top seven because its connection speeds aren&#39;t up to scratch — you&#39;ll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It&#39;s a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn&#39;t to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won&#39;t find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We&#39;re here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html">how to tell if your VPN is working</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren&#39;t always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla&#39;s speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it&#39;s actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it&#39;s using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN&#39;s origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It&#39;s a dealbreaker if you can&#39;t figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you&#39;ll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it&#39;s available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you&#39;re comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vpn-faqs">VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>To wrap up, let&#39;s answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don&#39;t cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we&#39;re talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you&#39;re assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it&#39;s possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN&#39;s servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won&#39;t trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN&#39;s IP address, not yours. If you&#39;re interested in more detail, I&#39;ve written a whole article on <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">how a VPN works</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN&#39;s IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn&#39;t blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN&#39;s homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn&#39;t mean that authorities can&#39;t detect that it&#39;s being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It&#39;s no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there&#39;s nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you&#39;re using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can&#39;t do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that&#39;s concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there&#39;s very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before.</p> 
<p>All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html">secretly working off the same backend</a>. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html">mobile devices</a>. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you&#39;re free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google&#39;s One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you&#39;re a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don&#39;t recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

The web app is intended for quick adjustments when away from home, such as LANs or tournaments, where downloading the full desktop version may not be possible or practical.</p>
<p>At launch, Synapse Web will only support the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards, though Razer says more devices will be added down the line. Using any Chromium-based browser, users can make quick changes to key settings, apply Chroma RGB quick effects and manage on-board profiles. These profiles can then be viewed, edited and saved directly to the keyboard’s device memory, so the configuration stays consistent when moving between PCs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says the new web-based tool is meant to &quot;complement&quot; Synapse 4, the most recent desktop version, but its appeal may be in providing an alternative altogether.

Razer says you&#39;ll still need the full app for advanced customization and &quot;deeper device integration&quot; like multi-device RGB syncing or game-specific profiles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-made-a-web-app-version-of-synapse-170715465.html?src=rss]]></description>

But, first, it's important to get this out of the way: The new AirTag still doesn't have a keyring hole, so you'll still need <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">accessories like a case, holder or secure pocket</a>.</p><p>Once you get over that, the new Apple AirTag does offer some nice improvements. For starters, it's now powered by Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip — the same one used in the iPhone 17 lineup and for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It also uses <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html" data-i13n="slk:Precision Finding;cpos:3;pos:1">Precision Finding</a> to reach items up to 50 percent further away than the previous AirTag model. This feature will now work with any Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 or a later iteration of either.&nbsp;That means the directional guidance that shows you down to a few feet where your AirTags are will be available on those compatible watches in addition to your iPhone. </p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a0306be0-fac3-11f0-bf75-60455910936b" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a0306be0-fac3-11f0-bf75-60455910936b" style="height:2400px;width:1971px;" alt="New AirTag." data-uuid="7fba2953-2396-3df0-b034-b3d1c21e0088"><figcaption>New AirTag.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The new AirTag is also 50 percent louder than before and has what Apple calls a "distinctive new chime."

Most of the holiday deals are over by now, but plenty of services are still offering excellent prices. With access to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a>, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and any advertisers it may sell that data to — all while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from all across the globe.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, but if you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to mistakenly end up paying more than you want to, as otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even with all those caveats, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

The company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html">unveiled</a> its next-generation business laptop at CES earlier this month, all of them powered by the latest <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html">Intel Core Ultra Series 3</a> processors.</p>

In more real-world terms, if you’re on a work trip and know you won’t always have a power supply to hand, you can trust one of these to get you through a day of heavy multi-tasking.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Prestige models are encased in full aluminum and are slimmer than their predecessors. They feature vapor chamber cooling and dual-fan architecture to ensure they stay cool and quiet while you work. If you pick up one of the convertible 2-in-1 Flip models, you can work with a stylus too.</p>
<p>There’s a 2.8K OLED display option for the Prestige 16 and 16 Flip, with support for VRR and DisplayHDR True Black 1000. The Flip 14 keeps the OLED, but the resolution drops to FHD+ and you lose the VRR.</p>

While the teams playing in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-watch-the-2026-super-bowl-patriots-vs-seahawks-channel-where-to-stream-and-more-173222330.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Super Bowl 2026</a> are the true stars of the show (and <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/article/super-bowl-weekend-musical-lineup-bad-bunny-green-day-olivia-dean-and-post-malone-are-all-set-to-perform-195657927.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Bad Bunny</a>, of course), your TV is a pretty important part of the puzzle of putting together an excellent Super Bowl party. Maybe you’ve been thinking about replacing an aging set, or you’re itching for a full refresh of your <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-best-gear-to-upgrade-your-home-theater-setup-130000755.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">home theater setup</a> — either way, you’ll want to try to get a good deal on a new TV. Thankfully, the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl can be a great time to shop for a new TV.<br><br>Generally, TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. Some 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are forthcoming things year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, now is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV. Here, we’ve curated the best Super Bowl TV deals we could find this year, from already affordable sets discounted even further to high-end OLEDs that are hundreds of dollars off.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-for-less-than-500">Super Bowl 2026 TV deals for less than $500</h2>
<p>You can easily find solid 1080p and 4K TV sets within this budget-friendly price range. What you’ll be more limited in is size — most TV deals under $500 we’re seeing right now are on sets up to 55 inches. There are a few 65- and 75-inch models in there, but the pickings are slim.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-oled-tv-deals">OLED TV deals</h2>

That&#39;s a 50 percent discount on the service&#39;s normal $100 price.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarch.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

It’s officially available starting January 28, and includes a one-month free trial. The key shift is that some of these apps are now subscription-only on iPad, even as Apple continues to offer one-time purchases on the Mac – albeit with slightly different feature offerings. Here’s everything you need to know about Apple Creator Studio and the programs it includes.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-apple-creator-studio-includes">What Apple Creator Studio includes</h2>
<p>At its core, Apple Creator Studio gives subscribers access to Apple’s professional video, music and imaging apps. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-bundles-creative-apps-such-as-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-into-a-single-subscription-145210038.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">bundle includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage</a>. Pixelmator Pro (which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-is-buying-the-developer-of-one-of-the-iphones-best-photo-editing-apps-165853866.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Apple acquired in late 2024</a>) is also coming to iPad for the first time, with a touch-optimized interface and Apple Pencil support.</p>
<p>A Creator Studio subscription also unlocks premium content and features inside Apple’s productivity apps. Keynote, Pages and Numbers remain free, but subscribers get access to premium templates and themes, plus a new Content Hub with Apple-curated photos, graphics and illustrations. Similar paid features are coming to Freeform later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>Apple is also using the bundle to introduce new “intelligence” features across several apps. In Final Cut Pro, the new Beat Detection feature can analyze a music track and show a beat grid so you can line edits up to the rhythm. The app is also getting tools like transcript search and visual search designed to make it easier to find moments across footage.</p>
<p>Logic Pro is gaining new AI-assisted Session Players and workflow features on Mac and iPad. Pixelmator Pro continues to rely heavily on machine learning for tasks like background removal, image repair and image upscaling. Note that some of these features require an Apple Intelligence-capable device.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-which-devices-are-supported">Which devices are supported</h2>
<p>Apple Creator Studio works across multiple Apple platforms, though not every app is available everywhere.</p>
<p>On the Mac, subscribers get access to all six apps: Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage.</p>
<p>On the iPad, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro are included. Motion, Compressor and MainStage remain Mac-only.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, Creator Studio does not include full versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro or Pixelmator Pro. Instead, it unlocks premium features and content inside Keynote, Pages and Numbers, and eventually Freeform.</p>
<p>Apple says the best experience is on macOS 26, iPadOS 26 and iOS 26 or later, with individual app requirements varying by device and chip.&nbsp;</p>

College students and educators get a steep discount: the education plan costs $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year, and it also comes with a one-month free trial.</p>
<p>A standard subscription can be shared with up to five other people using Family Sharing, allowing six users total. Education subscriptions are limited to individual use and cannot be shared. Apple is also offering three free months of Creator Studio to customers who purchase a qualifying new Mac or iPad around launch.</p>
<p>But Creator Studio isn’t the only way you can access most of these apps. Apple says all of the major apps included in Creator Studio will continue to be available as one-time purchases on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro remains priced at $299.99, Logic Pro at $199.99, Pixelmator Pro at $49.99, Motion at $49.99, Compressor at $49.99 and MainStage at $29.99. Users who already own these apps can keep using them and re-download them from the App Store as usual.</p>
<p>On the iPad, however, things are different. Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro for iPad are only available through the Creator Studio subscription. There is no standalone purchase option for those apps on iPadOS.</p>
<p>Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform remain free for everyone to download and use. Apple says those apps will continue receiving updates, including the upcoming visual design changes tied to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.</p>
<p>Without a Creator Studio subscription, you can still create, edit and collaborate in those apps. What you will not get are the paid templates, Content Hub assets and certain intelligence features.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-happens-to-your-projects-if-you-cancel">What happens to your projects if you cancel</h2>
<p>Apple says projects and content you create with an active subscription remain licensed as part of your original work.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro projects remain on your devices and can be copied or shared elsewhere. But you will need an active subscription to open or edit projects in those paid apps.</p>
<p>Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform documents remain editable without a subscription. However, you will not be able to make new edits that rely on paid features once your subscription ends.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-other-information-about-the-apple-creator-studio-app-bundle">Other information about the Apple Creator Studio app bundle</h2>
<p>Apple Creator Studio also comes with some immediate trade-offs. Alongside the bundle, Apple confirmed that the older Pixelmator app for iPhone and iPad, now described as Pixelmator Classic, will no longer receive updates. Apple says it will remain functional, but development is shifting to Pixelmator Pro, including the new iPad version included with Creator Studio.</p>
<p>But don&#39;t expect the standalone versions of the apps to maintain feature parity with their Creator Studio counterparts.

<p>More broadly, the bundle puts Apple more directly in competition with Adobe and other subscription-focused creative platforms, especially for people who are looking for a lower monthly entry point. At the same time, Apple is keeping one-time purchases on the table for Mac users, even as iPad access moves behind a subscription.</p>
<p>Apple Creator Studio will be available January 28. Whether it makes sense will likely come down to which device you work on and whether you would otherwise pay upfront for one or more of Apple’s pro apps.</p>

A description of the upcoming season shared with the outlet reads, “In season four, Ted returns to Richmond, taking on his biggest challenge yet: coaching a second division women’s football team. Throughout the course of the season, Ted and the team learn to leap before they look, taking chances they never thought they would.”</p>

Also shown are newcomers Grant Feely as Ted&#39;s son and Tanya Reynolds as an assistant coach.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The peak time for deals on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That&#39;s $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

The glasses’ operating system can help you get things done faster based on what they see and what they know about your behaviors. Snap also says that its smartglasses can keep you present in the moment with friends and family unlike phones and computers, since they superimpose digital tools over your view of the real world.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn has long been a platform for showing off professional accomplishments. Now, the company is leaning into the rise of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115135/what-is-vibe-coding-exactly/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">vibe coding</a> by allowing users to show off their proficiency with various AI coding tools directly on their profiles.</p><p>The company is partnering with Replit, Lovable, Descript and Relay.app&nbsp; on the feature and is working on integrations with fellow Microsoft-owned GitHub as well as Zapier.&nbsp; LinkedIn has always allowed users to add various skills and certifications to their profiles. But what makes the latest update a bit different is that users aren&#39;t self-reporting their own qualifications. Instead, LinkedIn is allowing the companies behind the AI tools to assess an individual&#39;s relative skill and assign a level of proficiency that goes directly to their profile.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, AI app maker Lovable could award someone a &quot;bronze&quot; in &quot;vibe coding,&quot; while the platform Replit uses numerical levels and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Relay.app" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Relay.app</a></a> may determine that someone is an &quot;intermediate&quot; level &quot;AI Agent Builder,&quot; according to screenshots shared by LinkedIn. These levels should dynamically update as people get more experience using the relevant tools, according to LinkedIn. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-27_at_16.04.45.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-27_at_16.04.45.png" style="height:150px;width:744px;" alt="Lovable&#39;s vibe coding rating system." data-uuid="89c0a2ca-15c4-4272-936b-cc5a889480ef"/><figcaption>Lovable&#39;s vibe coding rating system.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LinkedIn</div></figure><p>Of course, the update also comes at a time when companies have used these same kinds of AI tools to lay off thousands of workers. So while there&#39;s may be value in showing off your vibe coding skills, there are still many workers who likely aren&#39;t as excited about&nbsp; ceding more ground to AI. When I asked, LinkedIn&#39;s head of career products Pat Whealan about this he said that&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;AI-specific skills are an increasingly important signal to recruiters and the latest update will make it easier for them to assess candidates&#39; skills. But he added that the intention isn&#39;t to make AI-specific skills the sole focus. &quot;This is less about replacing any of those other existing signals, and more about showing new ways that people are doing work,&quot; he tells Engadget. &quot;And how do we give a verifiable signal to both hirers and other people looking at their profile, that they actually are using these tools on a regular basis.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/linkedin-will-let-you-show-off-your-vibe-coding-expertise-140000776.html?src=rss]]></description>

Thanks to a (now permissions-restricted) <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/479094248?pli=1"><ins>bug report</ins></a> discovered on Google&#39;s Issue Tracker, we have what is almost certainly a first look at the Android-on-desktop project, codenamed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/aluminium-os-android-for-pcs-3619092/"><ins>Aluminium OS</ins></a>.</p>
<p>First spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/27/android-desktop-leak/"><em><ins>9to5Google</ins></em></a>, the bug report was about Chrome incognito tabs and included two screen recordings. The description said the recordings were from an HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook. The video shows a &#39;chrome://version/&#39; page where one can see the OS listed as Android 16. <em>9to5Google </em>also said the bug report listed &quot;ALOS&quot; as the operating system, understood to stand for Aluminium OS, along with a corresponding build number that matches the one seen in the screen recordings.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UI looks like a clear blend of ChromeOS and Android aesthetics, with an Android-style taskbar across the bottom and status bar across the top, with familiar battery and Wi-Fi indicators. The videos also show the Play Store, windowed apps, split-screen multitasking and a version of Chrome with an extensions button, which is currently only available on the desktop version. Google has yet to comment on the leak, so users may have to wait for future Android 16 updates for a more in-depth look at the upcoming desktop experience.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/our-first-look-at-googles-android-for-pc-interface-leaks-in-a-bug-report-133006008.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is recommending measures to give publishers more control over how their content is used in Google’s AI overviews. The aim is to “provide a fairer deal for content publishers, particularly news organizations,” the CMA’s chief executive Sarah Cardell said in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-proposes-package-of-measures-to-improve-google-search-services-in-uk" data-i13n="slk:press release;cpos:1;pos:1">press release</a>. </p><p>With Google accounting for more than 90 percent of search inquiries in the UK, the CMA recently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-uks-antitrust-regulator-will-keep-a-closer-eye-on-google-search-130021994.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">designated</a> the company with “strategic market status” for search under the Digital Market Act. That allows the regulator to apply “conduct requirements” on Google to promote competition and avoid antitrust issues.</p><p>With those new powers, the CMA proposed a number of measures today. The first is a set of controls that would allow publishers to opt out of their content being used for features like AI Overviews or to train AI models. Google would also need to properly attribute publisher content. </p><p>Another measure would require Google to apply fair search result rankings for businesses, with an “effective process for raising and investigating issues.” Google would also need to provide a “choice screen” for alternative search options on Android mobile and Chrome browsers. </p><p>“These targeted and proportionate actions would give UK businesses and consumers more choice and control over how they interact with Google’s search services — as well as unlocking greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy,” Cardell said in a statement.</p><p>In response, Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-ai-features-controls/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">wrote</a> that it’s “exploring updates to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features.” The aim, it said, is to keep search helpful for people who want information quickly while allowing publishers to better manage content. “Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,” the company wrote, adding that it’s “optimistic” it can meet the CMA’s requirements.</p><p>When its new designation was announced in October 2025, Google complained that some of the proposed interventions would inhibit UK innovation and growth. Citing a study, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-ai-features-controls/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">said</a> that similar measures imposed by the European Union produced “negative results” that “have cost businesses $114 billion.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/uk-wants-to-give-web-publishers-a-fairer-deal-with-googles-ai-overviews-132742850.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-design">Design</h2>
<p>Shokz has a number of over-the-ear hook earbud designs under its belt, and they all carry the OpenFit name. That is also an apt description of these products since they all sit outside of your ear canal, which inherently allows you to remain aware of your surroundings. The company currently offers the OpenFit 2 and 2+ in addition to the OpenFit Air, at prices ranging from $120 to $200. The OpenFit Pro looks similar to its predecessors, albeit with a slightly smaller main housing and more pops of silver. Those ear hooks have a titanium wire inside and are wrapped in “ultra-soft” silicone. They’re plenty flexible and provide a secure yet comfortable fit for daily wear and workouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both earbuds of the OpenFit Pro have tiny physical controls for media playback, volume adjustments, calls and noise settings. The various actions are customizable through the Shokz app. During several weeks of testing, these buttons responded quickly to my clicks and using them didn’t cause the OpenFit Pro to shift out of place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenFit Pro comes with a charging case that&#39;s larger than most other earbuds, which is understandable since Shokz had to accommodate that ear hook. However, the case is quite flat, so it doesn’t take up too much room and easily fits in a small pocket. There’s a USB-C port around back for charging and a Bluetooth pairing button inside. The case also supports wireless charging, if your charging pad is large enough.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-noise-reduction-vs-noise-cancellation">Noise reduction vs. noise cancellation</h2>
<p>The OpenFit Pro is the first set of Shokz earbuds with what the company calls Open-Ear Noise Reduction. This is essentially the company’s take on active noise cancellation (ANC), but it’s&nbsp;designed to be effective with earbuds that don’t enter your ear canals. Since your ears aren&#39;t completely sealed off from the noise of the outside world, Shokz is limited in just how much sound it can reduce. But I’m happy to report the company’s microphone and algorithm combo is actually quite effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shokz says its noise reduction works best in moderately loud environments, like offices and cafes. I’ve found the OpenFit Pro does well to reduce the distraction of constant noise sources like HVAC systems, fans and white noise machines. The earbuds completely silenced a particularly raucous HVAC fan in my hotel room during CES. It&#39;s not <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the most effective</a> at cutting down environmental noise, but in exchange you get a more comfortable set of earbuds while also remaining somewhat alert and aware of your surroundings</p>

<p>The OpenFit Pro is Shokz’ most premium set of earbuds, so the features don’t end at noise reduction. Head tracking, customizable EQ, multipoint pairing, find my earbuds and wear detection are also available here. The company’s app displays battery percentages for each earbud and the case right at the top of the main screen with access to the rest of its tools just below. You don’t have to go searching and tapping through menus until you’ve found what you’re looking for. As someone who has to contend with <em>a lot </em>of headphone apps, I appreciate when all of the options are quickly available from the home screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like other companies offer on their open-type earbuds, Shokz has given the EQ settings a few presets specifically designed for the open nature of the product. Those include a Vocal option that boosts mids for audiobooks or calls and a Private mode that reduces high frequency sounds to prevent leakage. I usually kept the OpenFit Pro around 70 percent volume, which is loud enough that a nearby neighbor in a quiet room could hear the muffled rage of Incendiary’s “Echo of Nothing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another audio feature that’s worth mentioning is Dolby Atmos support. More specifically, the OpenFit Pro is “optimized for Dolby Atmos,” thanks in part to the aforementioned Dolby Head Tracking. You can disable the enhanced audio and head tracking individually in the Shokz app, but I found leaving Atmos on all the time, even when I wasn’t listening to Dolby Atmos music, gave the earbuds a more immersive, more detailed sound profile.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-sound-quality-and-calls">Sound quality and calls</h2>
<p>Overall sound quality is another area where the OpenFit Pro shines. Many open-design earbuds struggle to manage much bass or detailed highs, both of which Shokz has addressed with its driver design. Dual 11x20mm diaphragms power a larger, rectangular driver that’s the equivalent of a 16.7mm round driver in a “normal” set of earbuds. For comparison, most in-ear models typically use 10-12mm drivers, with smaller designs housing 6-8mm units. Shokz says it tuned the OpenFit Pro with what it calls OpenBass 2.0 and DirectPitch 3.0, features that provide better bass performance and audio that’s beamed more directly into your ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that combines for some truly impressive audio performance in a set of open earbuds. The OpenFit Pro still doesn’t muster the bombastic bass that earbuds like the WF-1000XM5 offer, but the low-end performance here is greatly improved over other open models like the LinkBuds Clip. While Thrice’s “Silhouette” still has enough driving kick drum, bass guitar and riffs to do the track justice, there isn’t as deep of a growl as the song has on flagship options from Bose, Sony and Sennheiser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also more clarity and detail in the tuning here than on other open models, which is on full display when listening to albums like Wet Leg’s alternative masterpiece <em>moisturizer. </em>I love how I can hear the texture of the guitars and drums, and even the vocals, which are the kind of subtle details open earbuds typically lack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should also mention that overall sound quality will depend on how the OpenFit Pro sits on your ears. I can easily improve the bass tone if I slightly push the earbuds in closer to my ear canals, but all of the observations I just made were with the earbuds in their natural resting position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shokz says the three-microphone setup that assists with its noise reduction tech also helps with calls. That configuration, combined with AI-powered voice recognition, should be able to block over 99 percent of background noise and deliver sharper vocal clarity overall. While that first part holds true — the OpenFit Pro does a great job canceling any ambient roar — the overall voice quality here is below average. It will certainly work for casual chats, but I wouldn’t recommend it for regular work calls or any scenario where you might need to record what you’re saying. My voice sounded muffled during calls and voice memos, more like I would over speakerphone than a set of carefully tuned earbuds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-openfit-pro-battery-life">OpenFit Pro battery life</h2>
<p>Shokz promises up to 12 hours of battery life on the OpenFit Pro with up to 50 hours of total use when you factor in the charging case. That’s with noise reduction disabled though; you can expect up to six hours with that turned on (24 hours total with the case). During weeks of testing, I never encountered any issues hitting those figures and the OpenFit Pro never struggled to get through a full work day of music, podcasts and calls using a combination of the default Open Mode and Noise Reduction mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the charging case can be topped up wirelessly if you have a compatible accessory that’s large enough. And if you find yourself with a pair of completely dead earbuds, Shokz includes a quick-charge feature that gives you up to four hours of use in 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

The $200 OpenFit 2+ offers 11 hours of battery life and Dolby Audio with both physical buttons and touch controls. The most affordable option, the OpenFit Air ($120), lasts up to six hours on a charge but doesn’t have enhanced audio or wireless charging. As you step down from the OpenFit Pro, you’re missing out on noise reduction, Dolby Atmos and longer battery life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JBL will soon have three models of its own to rival the Shokz OpenFit line.

These all have a variety of seemingly handy features, but none of them offer any kind of noise reduction and they all have shorter battery life than the OpenFit Pro and OpenFit 2+. I also cannot vouch for them as I haven’t tested any of JBL’s open designs yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shokz has achieved a rare feat. The company managed to build a set of open-fit earbuds that retain all of those inherent benefits while also providing some relief from distractions with noise reduction. No, the over-the-ear hook design isn’t for everyone — especially if you wear glasses — but the comfy, secure fit and IP55 rating make these a great choice for workouts.

Sound quality is better than you’ll find on most open earbuds as well, but you’ll probably enjoy not having anything crammed into your ears most. And you don’t have to make too many sacrifices here for that satisfaction. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">confirmed</a> that it’s letting go of 16,000 workers and employees across its organization. In an announcement by company SVP Beth Galetti, she explained that Amazon was going through organizational changes to reduce layers and remove bureaucracy. Affected employees in the US will be given 90 days to look for another internal role and will receive severance pay if they do not find any. Galetti also said that Amazon doesn’t have plans to announce “broad reductions every few months” but admitted that the company could “make adjustments as appropriate.”</p><p>News about the layoffs was leaked in an email mistakenly sent out early to workers, along with a calendar invitation for a meeting dubbed internally as “Project Dawn.” In the email seen by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/premature-amazon-layoff-email-touches-off-social-media-panic" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>BBC</em></a>, Amazon Web Services Senior Vice President Colleen Aubrey told workers that their “impacted colleagues” from the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been notified. “Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” Aubrey reportedly wrote in the email. </p><p>Amazon <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">eliminated 14,000 roles</a> back in October 2025 across its games, logistics, payment and cloud computing divisions, with the availability of AI technologies  being one of the main reasons for the layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it&#39;s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Amazon said in its announcement back then. This new round of layoffs is just a continuation of the previous one, as Amazon was reportedly looking to let 30,000 people go from the start. </p><p>The announcement comes shortly after Amazon revealed that it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/amazon-go-and-fresh-stores-are-closing-as-amazon-focuses-on-grocery-delivery-and-whole-foods-180448412.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">shutting down</a> its remaining Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores and will focus on grocery deliveries instead. To note, Amazon’s year-over-year net sales grew by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2025 alone. Its net income increased to $21.2 billion compared to the $15.3 billion it posted in the third quarter of 2024. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-latest-round-of-layoffs-will-affect-16000-workers-120000702.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Windscribe is a virtual private network (VPN) with intense &quot;How do you do, fellow kids?&quot; energy. It has servers in 69 countries and an annual plan that costs $69, an obsession with the sex number that rivals Elon Musk&#39;s. I&#39;m shocked that it doesn&#39;t have a subscription costing $4.20 per month.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s another side to Windscribe&#39;s cringe: an obsession with independence and a Bernie Sanders-like anger on behalf of an exploited public. In a market where the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPNs</a> aim for professionalism, Windscribe aspires to be punk. Its iconoclasm may have led it to develop an app that looks like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> in a trash compactor, but it also spurred Windscribe to offer a strong free plan and forgo financial relationships with VPN reviewers. That attitude earned it a spot on my list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best free VPNs</a>.</p>
<p>Although Windscribe&#39;s heart is in the right place, my job is to figure out whether that translates into a good product. I used our rigorous <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">VPN testing procedure</a> to rate Windscribe in 11 categories. You can find my results in the table below and a final verdict at the end of the review.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-installing-configuring-and-using-windscribe">Installing, configuring and using Windscribe</h2>
<p>The first step is always to figure out how easy or hard the VPN is to use. Windscribe and other VPNs are important tools, but you&#39;ll never use them if the UI gets in the way. I tested Windscribe&#39;s desktop apps on Windows and Mac, its mobile apps on iOS and Android and its Chrome and Firefox browser extensions.</p>
<p>To start with, let me say that installing Windscribe is a breeze no matter where you do it. The downloaders and installers handle their own business, only requiring you to grant a few permissions. The apps arrive on your system ready to use out of the box.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll notice about Windscribe is that it&#39;s not even slightly interested in looking like any other VPN. It crams everything into an extremely compact window, which has some advantages — mainly that it&#39;s easy to operate it while looking at another app. On the downside, well, it looks like this.</p>

<p>The Windscribe team will probably just say that I&#39;m brainwashed by the establishment, but there&#39;s a good reason that most VPNs choose designs with a little more space. This fiddly console, most of which is taken up by information you can&#39;t interact with, is likely to confirm all a newcomer&#39;s worst fears about using a VPN. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Private Internet Access</a> had a similar problem of tightening its app design to the point of being incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The problems persist when you get to the settings page. It&#39;s easy to make sense of a VPN without technical knowledge, but Windscribe&#39;s preferences menu does everything it can to obscure that truth. Highly technical features are mixed in with options for casual users, and the explanatory blurbs usually cloud the issue even further.</p>
<p>Even the &quot;Look &amp; Feel&quot; settings somehow manage to be confusing. What is the difference between the Stretch, Fill and Tile modes for aspect ratio? What the heck is a Bundled background, and what does it matter whether it&#39;s Square, Palm, Ripple, Drip or Snow? The answers to all these can be found by playing around or looking in the knowledgebase, but a VPN really shouldn&#39;t require that for its most basic toggles.</p>
<p>Once you get used to Windscribe and learn where to find the features that actually matter, it runs quite smoothly. Connections are never delayed and there are none of the random error messages that have dogged me on other VPNs. In a world of VPNs that look great but run clunkily, Windscribe has built one that looks terrible but runs great. I can&#39;t complain about how well it works, but is it too much to ask for a provider that does both? (Oh, wait, that&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s macOS app is almost identical to its Windows app. That deserves praise in itself — you&#39;ll get much the same experience no matter which type of computer you use. But it also means the Mac app shares the same problems.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There&#39;s the same overly compact design cluttered with too much information. The same technobabble-filled options menu. And the same fundamental solidity underlying it all: a VPN that does the job beautifully but has no interest in being accessible. It would be a mistake to write Windscribe off because of its app design, but it&#39;s important to know what you&#39;ll have to work through.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-android">Android</h3>
<p>One thing I can&#39;t fault Windscribe for is a lack of consistency. The Android app looks a lot like the Windows and Mac apps, only lightly adapted for the mobile format. On these devices, the design decisions make more sense — the UI writing is still impenetrable for casual users, but the compact pages look a lot more normal on a phone screen.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3>
<p>There&#39;s not a lot to say about Windscribe on iOS that I haven&#39;t already said about the other three main platforms. Looking over all my screenshots, it seems fairly clear that Windscribe&#39;s problems — much like PIA&#39;s — come from starting on mobile and trying to make that same design work on desktop. It&#39;s still not great to look at, but I can at least see where they&#39;re coming from.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s extensions for Chrome and Firefox look a little like its desktop and mobile VPN apps, but they act a little differently. They serve the same basic purpose as the standalone apps — changing your IP address and location — but they&#39;re also customizable ad blockers for the web page you&#39;re currently on.</p>

<p>For example, in the image above, I can control what location Google perceives me to be in. But I can also control what gets blocked by choosing to let Google bypass certain features. Clicking the leftmost button makes the current website skip the VPN tunnel. The central button shuts off the ad blocker and the right-hand button shuts off the features on the Privacy section of the preferences menu. Like everything else about Windscribe, it&#39;s unintuitive but works great once you figure it out.</p>

<p>I used <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://speedtest.net" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">speedtest.net</a> to test Windscribe&#39;s speeds. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with the jargon, <strong>Ping </strong>measures a server&#39;s latency, which is how long it takes a single packet of data to reach it from your device. <strong>Download speed </strong>measures how much data can be downloaded at a time, while <strong>upload speed </strong>shows how quickly you can send data to the network. Think of ping as your car&#39;s speed in miles per hour and download and upload speed as the amount of traffic on the road.</p>
<p>As usual, I used the WireGuard protocol to run these tests, since it&#39;s almost always the fastest. Starting with my unprotected speeds at home in Portland, I moved gradually farther away until I was connecting to the other side of the world. Ideally, ping should increase linearly (not exponentially), while download and upload speeds don&#39;t dip much at all. I&#39;ve recorded Windscribe&#39;s performance in the table below.</p>

<p>Windscribe gave me some of the shortest latencies I&#39;ve ever seen — comparable to CyberGhost, whose ping lengths I was also very impressed by. Its download and upload speeds also look a lot like CyberGhost&#39;s, with both firmly in good-but-not-amazing territory.</p>
<p>However, Windscribe&#39;s speeds were a lot more consistent. Throughout the tests, I hardly ever saw major fluctuations in the same location, on any metric. The Nairobi server seemed to be under some strain, but that&#39;s not unusual for a VPN in Africa. Every location except for that one followed a smooth downward curve. I&#39;m happy with that; speed is one of the areas where you want your VPN to be reliably boring, not flashy.</p>
<p>Practically, a speed test like this suggests that Windscribe is best for gaming, livestreaming and video chatting, and that it&#39;s perfectly serviceable for any other task you could do online. You may not get the best speeds you&#39;ve ever seen, but unless your internet is bad to begin with, Windscribe should not slow it down enough to be noticeable.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-security-test">Windscribe security test</h2>
<p>I can say up top that Windscribe doesn&#39;t seem to have any dangerous security flaws, but I&#39;ll take this section to explain why I think that. To start with, it uses only the three <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">VPN protocols</a> currently known to be secure: WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2, plus a few other options all based on OpenVPN. With those options, you can be sure you&#39;re getting encryption that&#39;s currently uncrackable.</p>
<p>It also passed two batteries of tests I ran on its security. The first set of tests looks for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks and other slip-ups that might <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">reveal your real IP address</a>. The second checks whether data packets sent through the VPN tunnel are actually getting encrypted. Check each section below for details on how Windscribe did.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3>
<p>A VPN protocol determines how exactly a VPN makes contact between its own servers, your device and your ISP. Certain protocols can make your VPN run faster, stabilize a shaky connection or get into websites other protocols fail to unlock. If you&#39;re having a problem with your VPN, changing the protocol is one of the first troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>Windscribe makes a total of six protocols available, though it&#39;s really just three, since four of the six are variations on OpenVPN. <strong>WireGuard</strong> works on every platform, and is currently the fastest and most stable — its drawback used to be that it was new, but with the passage of time, it&#39;s no longer new enough to make it suspect.</p>
<p><strong>IKEv2</strong> is a connection protocol that uses the separate IPSec protocol for its security. This double team&#39;s main strength is reconnecting to the VPN when a device switches networks; it&#39;s also good at not draining phone batteries. Windscribe supports IKEv2 on Mac, iOS and Windows.</p>
<p><strong>OpenVPN </strong>is the oldest open-source VPN protocol, refined by over a decade of repeated probing by volunteers. It&#39;s not only relatively fast and highly secure, but comes in two flavors: <strong>TCP</strong>, which makes connections more stable, and <strong>UDP</strong>, which is usually faster and should be your first resort with OpenVPN. Windscribe supports OpenVPN on all platforms.</p>
<p>Windscribe rounds out the selection with two unique protocols, both focused on hiding your VPN traffic from firewalls and censors. <strong>Stealth </strong>uses the same connection ports as HTTPS, so it can&#39;t be blocked by shutting certain ports down entirely. <strong>WStunnel </strong>obfuscates connections even further by using the extremely common WebSocket technology to establish VPN connections. Both these proprietary protocols are much slower than the other options, but can save you if you find yourself repeatedly blocked while using Windscribe.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3>
<p>I started my leak tests by using <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a> to check several Windscribe servers for IP leaks of all sorts. Each time I connected and checked my location, I only saw the VPN server&#39;s IP address, never my real one. I tried to trip Windscribe up by switching servers while remaining connected, even changing continents, but my true location never once slipped out. This puts its security solidly above CyberGhost, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Norton VPN</a> and many others.</p>

<p>Windscribe automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while connected, so IPv6 leaks weren&#39;t going to be a thing. I finished the test by checking five servers using browserleaks.com/webrtc, finding no issues each time.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3>
<p>The final step is to make sure Windscribe is applying encryption properly through its VPN protocols. For this test, I used a free packet sniffer app called Wireshark to look directly at what my computer was sending out.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_Wireshark_test.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_Wireshark_test.png" style="height:1188px;width:2262px;" alt="Windscribe&#39;s encryption looks solid." data-uuid="7e5f0fb0-017b-4187-8daf-d0ca0e9a0057">

</figure>
<p>It&#39;s a bit hard to tell what&#39;s going on, but to summarize, I&#39;ve loaded a website without HTTPS protection and checked whether Windscribe managed to apply that protection. The lack of readable information in the data stream proves that its encryption is indeed working as expected.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-much-does-windscribe-cost">How much does Windscribe cost?</h2>
<p>Windscribe has three subscription options (not counting its free plan, which I&#39;ll discuss in a moment). One month of Pro service costs $9.00 — after Mullvad, the second-cheapest monthly subscription to a top-tier VPN. You can also pay $69 for a 12-month Pro subscription, working out to $5.75 per month. Both of these tiers give you the exact same set of Pro features and can be used on unlimited simultaneous devices.</p>

</figure>
<p>The third option is to build your own plan. Build-A-Plan is an interesting beast that&#39;s unique to Windscribe. When you choose a custom plan, you must spend at least $3 per month. Gaining access to all the Pro servers in a country costs $1. For each country you add, you get an additional 10GB of data per month on top of the 10GB already included for free.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d rather not budget your data at all, you can pay another $1 for unlimited data, plus 10 custom rules for the R.O.B.E.R.T. content blocker (I&#39;ll untangle the tortured acronym soon). It&#39;s a little convoluted, but wonderfully flexible. You can even change your Build-A-Plan in the middle of the subscription period.</p>
<p>Windscribe also offers shared static IPs for an extra fee. You can add a datacenter IP to any plan for $2 per month or a residential IP (usually better at getting around restrictions) for $8 per month. Team billing is also available through ScribeForce at $3 per seat per month, including a centralized management panel.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-the-windscribe-free-plan">The Windscribe free plan</h3>
<p>Windscribe isn&#39;t the overall best free VPN — <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9e251e36-74b6-419a-8a7b-de182315da42&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=70d514cc-fd71-4f54-895d-164e9e7fa1e2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hide.me&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaGlkZS5tZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzBkNTE0Y2MtZmQ3MS00ZjU0LTg5NWQtMTY0ZTllN2ZhMWUyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaGlkZS5tZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYuP1UXKa9Pc-qMnHvjjlG6VCzmxghd2rThWvY8vFzFQ&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fhide.me" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hide.me;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" data-original-link="http://hide.me"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">hide.me</a> wins that honor with its more flexible data limit — but it&#39;s close. Free users get access to servers in 10 countries: the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Germany, Switzerland, Romania and Hong Kong. If you plot that on a map, you&#39;ll see that the Windscribe free plan is most useful in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Free users start with a data allotment of 2GB per month. The monthly limit rises to 10GB if you sign up with a confirmed email address and 15GB if you post about Windscribe on Twitter/X. That&#39;s enough for casual browsing, but streaming in standard definition takes about 1GB per hour, so you won&#39;t be doing much binge-watching.</p>
<p>On the upside, a free plan gives you access to all Windscribe&#39;s features except for dynamic port forwarding. You can set three R.O.B.E.R.T. rules and use your free account on an infinite number of devices (subject to the usual restrictions about exploiting that for commercial purposes — as Windscribe itself states, no one person has 30 devices that need a VPN).</p>

<p>Windscribe doesn&#39;t have any add-ons of its own except for static IP addresses. However, it does offer discount codes for a group of &quot;partners in privacy&quot; that share its business ethics. The coupon codes are available <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/windscribes-gang" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">here</a> and don&#39;t require a Windscribe subscription to use.</p>

<p>There are currently five allies in the gang. <strong>Control D</strong> offers DNS filtering for organizations to block unwanted websites; the Windscribe coupon gives you 50 percent off. You can get 25 percent off a one-year subscription to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://addy.io" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link"><strong>addy.io</strong></a>, an open-source email anonymizer, and <strong>Ente</strong>, an encrypted storage space for photos and videos.</p>
<p>Rounding out the team are <strong>Kagi</strong>,<strong> </strong>a private search engine which you can use for three months free with the Windscribe coupon, and <strong>Notesnook</strong>, an encrypted notes app. Windscribe&#39;s coupon gives you a 10% discount on Notesnook&#39;s yearly plans in perpetuity.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-close-reading-windscribes-privacy-policy">Close-reading Windscribe&#39;s privacy policy</h2>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s marketing positions it as serious about user independence, so I came into this section hoping for a privacy policy that backs those words up. An early green flag is that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/privacy/" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">the policy</a> is short, succinct and obviously written to be read by the users themselves. It&#39;s also fantastic that you can sign up without an email address (though you will need one to get the full data allotment on the free plan).</p>
<p>Windscribe gathers information on its website using Piwik, an open-source analytics tool that it manages itself; no third parties are involved. The Windscribe app itself collects no information except for the amount of data used in a month, the time of your last connection and the number of devices you have online at once. When actively connected, it also gives you an anonymized username necessary for the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols.</p>
<p>My only quibble is that Windscribe is oddly reluctant to identify which third-party payment processors it uses. The information does exist elsewhere — <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/knowledge-base/articles/how-do-i-change-my-payment-methodupdate-credit-card-info/" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">an article</a> in the knowledgebase states that payments are handled by &quot;trusted third party processors such as PayPal and Stripe,&quot; and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/knowledge-base/articles/who-is-coinpayments-and-why-am-i-sending-my-crypto-to-them-and-not-you/" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">another page</a> says that CoinPayments handles cryptocurrency transactions. It&#39;s a small thing, but the rest of the policy is so airtight that it stands out.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-independent-privacy-audits">Independent privacy audits</h3>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s apps are fully open-source (you can find them on Github <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://github.com/Windscribe" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">here</a>). In addition to this general exposure, it&#39;s also undergone three intensive audits from security firms. Leviathan Security looked into its desktop apps in 2021 and its mobile apps in 2022. The auditors made a total of five high-severity recommendations, all of which Windscribe claims to have addressed.</p>
<p>More recently, Windscribe had its entire codebase audited by PacketLabs. The auditors&#39; June 2024 report found that some of Windscribe&#39;s code was storing more user information than it strictly needed to. Windscribe also claims to have handled this risk. More importantly, PacketLabs found no intentional subversions of Windscribe&#39;s no-logs policy, so its privacy statements can likely be trusted.</p>
<p>Further corroboration of the latter came from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/blog/windscribe-greek-court-case/" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">a 2025 court case</a> in which Windscribe founder and CEO Yegor Sak was indicted in Greece and charged with a crime committed by a Windscribe user through an IP address in Finland. This case is obviously absurd — like charging the head of GM with a single instance of vehicular manslaughter committed by someone driving a Buick — but Sak was obliged to appear in court anyway.</p>
<p>As Sak writes in the linked post, he could have turned over the logs and shown who actually committed the crime, but he couldn&#39;t since Windscribe doesn&#39;t keep that information. Had there been an alternative to waging an expensive and inconvenient legal campaign in another country, Sak would surely have taken it. The fact that he didn&#39;t is strong proof of Windscribe&#39;s no-logging policy.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-can-windscribe-change-your-virtual-location">Can Windscribe change your virtual location?</h2>
<p>Changing your IP address with a VPN can do more than just anonymize your internet activity. A service like Windscribe can give you an IP address associated with a certain country or region, letting you use the internet like you were there. This has applications ranging from the serious (break out of a nationwide firewall to document human rights issues) to the fun (get new titles on streaming platforms without paying for a new subscription).</p>
<p>Netflix is a great tool for testing whether a VPN can change your virtual location. Like most streamers, it tries to block all VPN access to protect the copyrights it holds. Consequently, if a VPN can crack Netflix, it must be serious about keeping its server network fresh to foil any potential blockers.</p>

<p>Windscribe got a perfect score. Netflix loaded easily every time, and the content was always localized to the country I chose. With this performance combined with its fairly consistent speeds over long distances, Windscribe makes a nearly perfect streaming VPN. The only downside is that the data limits on the free plan mean you&#39;ll probably have to pay for serious streaming time.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-investigating-windscribes-server-network">Investigating Windscribe&#39;s server network</h2>
<p>Windscribe has 193 server locations in 71 countries, which it insists on listing as &quot;69+&quot; (again, hilarious). Although 193 sounds like a lot, many of them are duplicate locations in the same city. This isn&#39;t necessarily a problem, but for accuracy&#39;s sake, the total number of cities with Windscribe servers is 122.</p>

<p>The bigger story here is Windscribe&#39;s spurning of virtual servers. A virtual server location is physically located in a different region than the one it outwardly displays. For example, a server with an Indian IP address might really be in Singapore. Throughout the entire Windscribe network, only two servers are virtual: one in India and one in Antarctica.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad. On the positive side, the near-total lack of virtual servers means you can be sure of how any server will perform. If it says it&#39;s in Buenos Aires, it&#39;ll run like it&#39;s in Buenos Aires — you won&#39;t be surprised with lagging speeds because it&#39;s really in Miami. This also makes it clear that Windscribe isn&#39;t interested in pumping up its network size for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, virtual locations aren&#39;t an inherently bad thing. Windscribe acts as though advertising hype is the only reason any VPN would employ them, but there are real use cases. Virtual servers can be used to place locations inside countries where real servers would risk confiscation by the government, like Russia, India and China. Windscribe chooses instead to place real servers in Russia and India, both of which have data retention laws that directly conflict with its own privacy policy.</p>
<p>Does this mean that using Windscribe&#39;s Russian servers will earn you a midnight visit from the FSB? Probably not. Assuming Windscribe is following its no-logs policy (which appears to be the case), there won&#39;t be any user data on those servers if the government seizes them. But it does mean they&#39;re effectively running illegal data centers which could be raided and shut down at any time. Be aware of this if you depend on Windscribe&#39;s locations in Russia or India.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-extra-features-of-windscribe">Extra features of Windscribe</h2>
<p>As covered in the UI section, Windscribe has a lot going on in its apps. The Connection tab alone has 13 different features, including two submenus with several options of their own. With this many options, and so many of them highly situational, I won&#39;t be able to cover every nook and cranny without this review getting seriously bloated. I&#39;ve instead chosen some of the most important and illustrative features to give you a clear sense of the whole picture.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-network-options">Network Options</h3>
<p>You&#39;ll find this feature at the top of the Connection tab. When you click Network Options, you should see the name of your current Wi-Fi network and all the others your Windscribe account has discovered. This feature lets you control how the VPN reacts to each network it encounters, not unlike <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">CyberGhost&#39;s Smart Rules</a>.</p>

<p>The app does a remarkably poor job of explaining how this works, so I&#39;ll break it down for you here. When the Auto-Secure Networks switch is turned on, Windscribe will automatically mark each new network as Secured — a word which here means &quot;Windscribe turns on when it encounters the network.&quot;</p>
<p>So far, so good. But if you turn Auto-Secure Networks off, things get weird. Without it, Windscribe tags every network you encounter as Unsecured. Whenever you connect to an Unsecured network, Windscribe immediately disconnects itself. This means it secures all Secured networks and does not secure any Unsecured networks.</p>
<p>It feels backwards until you realize that Windscribe is referring entirely to itself here. &quot;Secured&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that the Wi-Fi network is password-protected or otherwise considered safe, and &quot;Unsecured&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s open to the public without a password. All that matters is whether or not you want Windscribe to activate or deactivate on that network. It&#39;s a useful feature that even lets you choose a VPN protocol for each network, but it would help to bring it more in line with mainstream terminology.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-robert">R.O.B.E.R.T.</h3>
<p>This mouthful of a feature name allegedly stands for Remote Omnidirectional Badware Eliminating Robotic Tool. This is perhaps the apex of the VPN industry&#39;s unfortunate habit of saddling perfectly good features with word-salad names (yes, I&#39;m aware it&#39;s supposed to be funny).</p>
<p>R.O.B.E.R.T. is perhaps the most customizable content blocker on any VPN right now. To start with, it includes eight lists of sites it blocks at the DNS level: Malware, Ad + Trackers, Social Networks, Porn, Gambling, Clickbait, Other VPNs and Crypto. These vary in usefulness, and you can&#39;t determine the contents of each list, but it&#39;s nice to have such a range of choices.</p>

<p>Where R.O.B.E.R.T really shines, though, is in its browser-based customization dashboard. Each Free user can make three custom rules, and Pro upgrades that to 10. Each custom rule can be used to block a specific website or network or allowlist it from one of the other general blocklists. You can also set it to spoof a domain, though there&#39;s no practical reason to do this (Windscribe&#39;s idea of a &quot;useful&quot; application is making your friends think your post made the front page of Reddit).</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3>
<p>Split tunneling sends some of your internet requests through the VPN tunnel while others go unencrypted as normal. This can be useful if you get worse-than-usual speeds and want to minimize the amount of traffic going through the VPN, or for certain websites that refuse to work with any VPN server.</p>
<p>You can split tunnel on Windscribe&#39;s apps for Windows, Mac and Android. Windows and Android users can split by app or website, while Mac users can only split by website. Windscribe lets you choose whether your split tunnel will be inclusive (only apps and IPs on the list will go through the VPN) or exclusive (the apps and IPs on the list will not go through the VPN). Note that R.O.B.E.R.T. rules apply to the entire system, even excluded apps and domains.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-firewall-and-always-on-vpn">Firewall and Always On VPN</h3>
<p>Instead of a kill switch, which it derides as an incomplete solution, Windscribe includes a Firewall feature on desktop and an Always On VPN feature on mobile. The Firewall can be considered a strong kill switch that prevents any internet traffic from going outside the VPN tunnel — something doesn&#39;t have to go wrong for the blocks to activate. Always On VPN on iOS and Android is functionally the same.</p>
<p>A more proactive defense has its advantages, but it would be nice if Windscribe included the weak kill switch option. Kill switches and firewalls can be overactive, and sometimes, you don&#39;t want the strongest level of security.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-circumvent-censorship">Circumvent Censorship</h3>
<p>This feature is designed to let you access Windscribe on networks that don&#39;t want you to use a VPN, from school and work systems to entire censorious countries like China. Windscribe isn&#39;t forthcoming about how it works, but it&#39;s probably a deep-packet obfuscation that makes VPN traffic look like regular traffic. I didn&#39;t have time to pop over to China and test Circumvent Censorship, but I&#39;m glad it exists.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-customer-support-options">Windscribe customer support options</h2>
<p>Clicking the question mark tab on the Windscribe app shows you the full list of support options. You can peruse the knowledgebase, ask their chatbot Garry, talk directly to a human or check out their user communities on Reddit and Discord.</p>

<p>I started with the written FAQs. At the top of the knowledgebase, there&#39;s a row of buttons you can click to see only articles relating to a particular operating system. This is a good idea in theory, but it&#39;s not implemented very well — there&#39;s no visible tagging system, so we can&#39;t see how it&#39;s deciding which articles to filter.</p>
<p>The search bar is much more likely to get you where you need to go. It works instantaneously and always turns up relevant articles, though it&#39;s weirdly insistent on showing exactly 10 results. I have few complaints about articles themselves, which are written in a way any user should find useful (give or take yet more attempted humor).</p>
<p>I tested the chatbot, Garry, by asking it about the mysterious Advanced Parameters tab of the Windscribe app. It explained each feature on that tab (none of which should be touched except by users with technical knowledge) in a spiel that was clearly pre-written but nonetheless useful. Garry was launched in 2018, when IBM Watson was the biggest thing in AI, and recently revamped into &quot;Garry 2.0&quot; — whether this is based on OpenAI or another platform is anyone&#39;s guess at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-live-support">Live support</h3>
<p>Windscribe appears to handle all of its own support, without outsourcing to Zendesk or a similar third party. If you decide not to go through Garry, Windscribe does have the option of connecting directly to a human. However, the Contact Humans option on the app sends you directly back to Garry. It&#39;s eventually possible to get Garry to connect you to a real person, but that doesn&#39;t excuse Windscribe building an outright lie into its app.</p>
<p>The Contact Support button on the knowledgebase, which I expected to lead to a ticket submission, also sends you straight to Garry. Windscribe really, really wants you to use Garry, in case that wasn&#39;t clear. You might have a better time going straight to the Windscribe Discord server or the r/Windscribe subreddit, both of which are linked to in the app.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-background-check">Windscribe background check</h2>
<p>Windscribe eschews a lot of the things we&#39;ve come to expect from a VPN provider. It doesn&#39;t pay for ads anywhere. It has no affiliate relationships with news sites. The only thing resembling a Windscribe ad campaign is the free-plan data reward for Xeeting about it. It doesn&#39;t even have any venture capital investors — it&#39;s completely self-funded and self-hosted.</p>
<p>As a jaded and cynical reviewer who was already annoyed by Windscribe&#39;s memelord attitude, I was prepared to sniff out any hypocrisy in its background, which makes it all the more impressive that I didn&#39;t find any. Since its founding in Canada in 2016, Windscribe has never once been involved in any public doings that contradict its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/ethics" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">statements of ethics</a>. It&#39;s even given free unlimited VPN access to every journalist working in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The only thing I could find resembling a controversy was an incident in July 2021 when Ukrainian police <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/vpn-servers-seized-by-ukrainian-authorities-werent-encrypted/" data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1">confiscated two servers</a> that weren&#39;t fully encrypted. Although this would only have posed a risk to users running a customized connection profile under very specific conditions, it was still a lapse. Windscribe <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://medium.com/windscribe/openvpn-security-improvements-and-changes-7b04ea49222" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">responded appropriately</a> in my view, ending the legacy OpenVPN implementation that caused the problem.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-canadian-headquarters">Canadian headquarters</h3>
<p>Windscribe is based in Canada, which is one of the Five Eyes nations (along with the U.S., the U.K., Australia and New Zealand). This sounds scary, but it&#39;s not actually an issue, as Yegor Sak himself points out in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://medium.com/windscribe/i-doesnt-matter-how-many-eyes-you-have-66f59fc1e777" data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1">a blog post</a> I reference frequently.</p>
<p>Five Eyes is not an organization, but an agreement between five allied countries to share necessary intelligence with each other. This can absolutely be misused. If the U.S. government wants to spy on someone without running into the 4th Amendment, it can ask the Brits to spy on that person instead and tell them what they find, knowing the Constitution can&#39;t determine what other countries do to our citizens.</p>
<p>As bad as that is for our civil liberties, it doesn&#39;t actually change anything where VPNs are concerned. If a VPN isn&#39;t logging user data, there shouldn&#39;t be anything for any of the Five Eyes (or Nine Eyes or Fourteen Eyes) nations to find. And if it <em>is </em>keeping logs, you shouldn&#39;t be using it no matter where its headquarters are.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2>
<p>You might wonder, at this point, why my distaste for Windscribe&#39;s tryhard sense of humor has featured so prominently in this review. One reason is that I had to read a lot of it this week, and you must suffer as I have suffered. But it also makes Windscribe look very good by implication. Having no patience for the discount-4chan act that pervades Windscribe&#39;s brand, I was primed to dislike the VPN itself — and I simply couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>This is not to say I had no problems at all with Windscribe. Its physical servers in Russia are difficult to trust. Its help options lean way too heavily on Garry the chatbot. Its app design and UI writing are significant faults. The free plan doesn&#39;t give you enough data for streaming.</p>
<p>Having said all that, though, Windscribe does everything else right. It changes virtual locations and unblocks Netflix without breaking a sweat. Its servers keep latencies low, and download speeds remain solid across the world. The apps may look bad, but they never break down. Some features, like R.O.B.E.R.T. and Auto-Secure, are both useful to everybody and deeply customizable for power users.</p>
<p>Windscribe may be best for privacy nerds who know how all its doohickeys work, but it&#39;s a VPN I recommend for everybody. In a world of predatory software, it&#39;s a relief to use an app that&#39;s unabashedly on the customer&#39;s side.</p>
