<p>Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you&#39;re trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children&#39;s channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget&#39;s pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html"><ins>the best customizable live streaming service</ins></a> for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn&#39;t getting you all the channels you need, you don&#39;t need to pay that much more to get them.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

To watch those, you&#39;ll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn&#39;t available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month.</p> 
<p>Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you&#39;re getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV&#39;s DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV&#39;s interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you&#39;re likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-orange-day-passes-are-only-1-right-now-for-black-friday-231208163.html?src=rss]]></description>

Future Motion has gone the other direction and emphasized how its new product can pop infinite wheelies, which sounds like either loads of fun or a quick way to an injury, depending on your worldview.&nbsp;</p><p>After developing a line of single-wheel skateboards called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/onewheel-gt-pint-x-future-motion-180021707.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Onewheel</a>, Future Motion has released a new transportation option with an e-bike dubbed Antic. (Though I am deeply disappointed it isn&#39;t named Twowheel). The 70s-inspired design claims a top speed of 35 miles per hour, a range of 28 to 50 miles, and wide tires intended to handle many types of terrain. It also says that with its Wheelie Assist mode, the bike&#39;s gyroscopes and accelerometers can hold an endless single-wheel ride. The base model Antic has a list price of $2,500 but is currently discounted a few hundred bucks for the launch; longer-range options with more capable tires will run up to $2,900.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/onewheel-teams-antic-e-bike-can-pop-eternal-wheelies-230602296.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of Meta&#39;s top AI researchers, Yann LeCun, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@yannlecun/post/DRQL7I2jlco" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">is leaving</a> after 12 years with the company to found his own AI startup, he announced. LeCun, who is also a professor at New York University, joined the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-09-facebook-hires-nyu-professor-to-lead-its-ai-efforts.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in 2013</a> to lead Meta&#39;s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab and later took on the role of Chief AI Scientist.&nbsp;</p><p>LeCun said his new startup would &quot;continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond&quot; and that it would partner with Meta. &quot;The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences,&quot; he wrote in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@yannlecun/post/DRQL7_0DmDI" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">an update</a> on Threads. &quot;AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not. Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.&quot;</p><p>Speculation about LeCun&#39;s future at Meta has been mounting in recent months. Earlier this year, the company invested nearly $15 billion into Scale AI and made the 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, its Chief AI Officer. Meta also recruited Shengjia Zhao, who helped create GPT-4, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DMjD2LmSzyj/to-avoid-any-confusion-there-is-no-change-in-yanns-role-he-will-continue-to-be-c" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">making him</a> Chief AI Scientist of its newly created Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Superintelligence Labs</a> unit.&nbsp;</p><p>LeCun, on the other hand, has been openly skeptical of LLMs. &quot;We are not going to get to human-level AI by just scaling LLMs,&quot; he said during <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_a-new-podcast-with-alex-kantrowitz-activity-7308683959255613440-INPw/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1">an appearance</a> on the Big technology podcast earlier this year. And in a recent talk at a conference, he advised aspiring researchers to &quot;absolutely not work on LLMs,&quot; according to remarks <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/yann-lecun-ai-meta-0058b13c" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1">reported</a> by <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em></p><p>At the same time, Meta has been reshuffling its AI teams. The company cut &quot;several hundred&quot; jobs from its Superintelligence group, including from FAIR, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/22/meta-superintelligence-tbd-ai-reorg" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">last month</a>. And LeCun has &quot;had difficulty getting resources for his projects at Meta as the company focused more intently on building models to compete with immediate threats from rivals including OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Anthropic,&quot; <em>Bloomberg</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-19/meta-ai-s-lecun-to-announce-exit-startup-as-soon-as-this-week" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>LeCun said he will stay on at Meta until the end of the year. &quot;I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth (Boz), Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years,&quot; he wrote.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-chief-ai-scientist-is-leaving-the-company-after-12-years-224325268.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Letterboxd&#39;s foray into digital video rentals officially launches in December, the social film platform shared in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/letterboxd-video-store/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a new blog post</a>. Plans for a “Letterboxd Video Store” were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/letterboxd-will-launch-a-curated-online-rental-service-for-films-145056220.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">first announced</a> in March, but now Letterboxd has started to fill in some of the details of what kinds of movies its store will carry and where they&#39;ll be available to watch.</p><p>The collection of films available through the Letterboxd Video Store will be curated around a few categories, according to the company. Those include films featured at film festivals that currently don&#39;t have distribution, titles that continue to hang around in users&#39; watchlists, film restorations and &quot;limited-time drops of sneak peeks and unreleased gems.&quot; Letterboxd compared the process of narrowing down what films to try and offer like the &quot;employee picks&quot; shelf you might see at a local video store, only every Letterboxd user is an employee.</p><p>Films rented through Letterboxd will be available to watch on the web, iOS, Android, Apple TV and Android TV, and can be streamed to screens that support Chromecast and AirPlay. Letterboxd hasn&#39;t shared what its rental terms or prices will be, but did note that rental availability and cost will vary depending on your location. The company also warns that some films will only be available for a limited amount of time.</p><p>As an expansion on its core competencies of tracking what films you and your friends have watched and letting you review them, video rentals seem like a natural addition for Letterboxd. It&#39;s a bit like Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-28-amazon-acquires-goodreads-kindle-recommendation-engine.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">acquired</a> the book reviewing platform Goodreads in 2013, after establishing itself as a physical and digital bookseller. Letterboxd has defined itself as a trusted film reviewing platform, and now it&#39;s branching out into selling films. In the same way Goodreads can funnel readers back towards Amazon, Letterboxd can use movie fans to surface the best films to rent and keep them from heading somewhere else to watch them.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/letterboxd-will-start-renting-movies-in-december-214900026.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Warner Music Group (WMG) settled a lawsuit with an AI company in exchange for a piece of the action. The label <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investors.wmg.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/WARNER-MUSIC-GROUP-AND-UDIO-COLLABORATE-TO-BUILD-A-NEW-LICENSED-MUSIC-CREATION-SERVICE/default.aspx" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> on Wednesday that it had resolved <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/record-labels-sue-ai-music-generators-for-massive-infringement-of-recorded-music-172915925.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a 2024 lawsuit against AI music creation platform Udio</a>. As part of the deal, Udio gets to license Warner&#39;s catalog for an upcoming music creation service. This follows a similar <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.universalmusic.com/universal-music-group-and-udio-announce-udios-first-strategic-agreements-for-new-licensed-ai-music-creation-platform/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">settlement</a> between Universal Music Group and Udio, announced last month.</p><p>Udio&#39;s service will allow subscribers to create, listen to and discover AI-generated music trained on licensed work. You’ll be able to generate new songs, remixes and covers using favorite artists&#39; voices or compositions. The boundaries between human creation and an algorithm&#39;s approximation of it are about to grow murkier. Not in terms of artistic quality, but it will be based on what proliferates online.</p><p>WMG is framing the deal as a win for artists, who will — if they choose to opt in — gain a new revenue stream. Ahead of the service’s launch, Udio will roll out &quot;expanded protections and other measures designed to safeguard the rights of artists and songwriters.&quot;</p><p>So, the settlement does at least appear to reassert some control over artists’ work. What the normalization of robot-made music will do for society&#39;s collective tastes is another question.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/mohammad-metri-1oKxSKSOowE-unsplash.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/mohammad-metri-1oKxSKSOowE-unsplash.jpg" style="height:3975px;width:5955px;" alt="A neon sign on a wall, reading, &quot;You are what you listen to.&quot;" data-uuid="6dc487bf-745e-494e-9a1d-81b72e60107f"><figcaption>A neon sign on a wall, reading, &quot;You are what you listen to.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mohammad Metri / Unsplash</div></figure><p>The settlement echoes a warning Spotify <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/spotify-partners-with-the-big-three-music-labels-on-artist-first-ai-music-products-161047159.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">sounded to musicians and labels last month</a>. &quot;If the music industry doesn&#39;t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent or compensation,&quot; the company wrote. Spotify plans to launch &quot;artist-first AI music products&quot; in the future, a vague promise to be sure. However, given Udio&#39;s plans, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see the streaming service cooking up a similar licensed AI music-creation product.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,&quot; Warner Music CEO Robert Kyncl wrote in a press release. &quot;This collaboration aligns with our broader efforts to responsibly unlock AI&#39;s potential - fueling new creative and commercial possibilities while continuing to deliver innovative experiences for fans.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/warner-signs-ai-music-licensing-deal-with-udio-213433325.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Major League Baseball has entered a new broadcasting <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-announces-media-rights-deals-with-espn-nbc-netflix" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">deal</a> that will see Netflix hosting live games for the first time. Under this three-year agreement, Netflix will have the rights to air a new Opening Night game the evening ahead of the Opening Day matchups. It will also stream the T-Mobile Home Run Derby as well as select special events during the season, including the 2026 MLB at Field of Dreams Game and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/world-baseball-classic-inc-and-netflix-exclusive-partnership" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">previously announced</a> World Baseball Classic in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a limited amount of content, but aligns with Netflix&#39;s recent pushes into both live events and sports programming. Last year the streaming service inked deals to show a double-header of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">NFL games</a> on Christmas Day and snagged exclusive US rights to two <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-scores-the-broadcasting-rights-to-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-174017963.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup tournaments</a>. Netflix has previously gotten access to documentary content from the MLB, but 2026 will mark its first time showing live baseball.&nbsp;</p><p>The MLB deal also included some shuffling on the broadcast side, moving certain matches between ESPN and NBCUniversal properties. Apple TV will still have the rights to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apples-friday-night-baseball-is-back-on-march-28-with-a-world-series-documentary-in-tow-222335747.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Friday night games</a> going forward. So between the growing number of platforms grabbing slices of viewership and the MLB&#39;s existing blackout rules, in future seasons you&#39;ll need to undertake a thorough research assignment to figure out where you can watch each game. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-lands-a-deal-with-mlb-to-air-select-live-baseball-games-213336003.html?src=rss]]></description>

Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, you shouldn't jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay.</p>
<p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table, especially as we approach Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the holiday season. VPN providers want to boost their subscriber numbers, so they give out steep discounts to customers who sign up for a year or more at once. This is a win for you as well — while you pay more at the start, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube has started a renewed effort to integrate direct messaging into its platform. According to a support <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&amp;msgid=388556429" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">page</a>, the service has started testing DMs as a way for users to share and discuss videos. The test is for users aged 18 and up in Ireland and Poland. But while a DM usually comes with some expectation of privacy, Google noted that &quot;messages may be reviewed to ensure they follow our Community Guidelines.&quot;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the video platform&#39;s first attempt to provide a messaging angle. YouTube <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-07-youtube-direct-sharing-messaging-android-ios-app.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">added</a> DMs to its app in 2017, then <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-youtube-killing-direct-messaging.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">removed</a> the feature in 2019 in order to emphasize public conversations in comments sections. The new test for sharing within YouTube&#39;s ecosystem won&#39;t mean any change to other ways you might send people videos. Re-introducing the same system six years after cutting it seems like an odd choice, but Google claims this is &quot;a top feature request,&quot; so maybe it&#39;ll get a broader adoption this time around.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-is-once-again-trying-to-make-dms-happen-205724221.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Admittedly, we have seen this model a bit cheaper in the past, but if you’re on cooking duty for Thanksgiving, you might not have the option of waiting until what <em>could</em> be a deeper discount on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-tech-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-anker-and-others-100052831.html">Black Friday</a>. And the DZ401 is the perfect air fryer for the holiday season, owing to its trademark dual baskets, which allow you to cook up two completely different foods simultaneously. It takes up a fair amount of space, but it’s worth it if you have a lot of hungry mouths to feed.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>This 10-quart fryer includes a smart cook thermometer and six cooking modes, including air broil, roast and dehydrate alongside the default air fry mode. The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert.</p> 
<p>The Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">buying guide</a> for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s well-documented that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/15/about-a-quarter-of-us-teens-have-used-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-double-the-share-in-2023/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">many students</a> use ChatGPT to do their homework for them, and now OpenAI would like teachers to use it to write those student&#39;s homework, too. The company hopes to entice K-12 school employees to work with its AI models via the newly announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-for-teachers/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ChatGPT for Teachers</a>, a version of the AI assistant that&#39;s secure enough to be used in a school environment and free until June 2027.</p><p>OpenAI pitches this new ChatGPT as a way for educators to create material for the classroom, &quot;and get comfortable using AI on their own terms.&quot; ChatGPT for Teachers includes unlimited messages with GPT-5.1 Auto, connectors to other apps, file uploads, image generation and memory features, just like the consumer version of the AI. </p><p>Where this version differs is in its compliance with the Family Education Rights Act, which governs how schools store student information, and in the ways OpenAI is pushing collaboration features. Besides being able to share a chat with colleagues, OpenAI says it&#39;ll also populate fresh chats with suggestions of ways other teachers have used ChatGPT.</p><p>Before it began targeting teachers specifically, OpenAI made several passes at getting more students to use its AI models. The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-has-a-has-a-new-version-of-chatgpt-just-for-universities-191350708.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ChatGPT Edu</a> gives institutions a way to offer ChatGPT access in the same way they do an email account. There&#39;s also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpts-study-mode-will-guide-students-to-an-answer-stey-by-step-180614172.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Study Mode</a>, a feature available in all versions of ChatGPT, that focuses the chatbot&#39;s answers on explaining things step-by-step. </p><p>OpenAI isn&#39;t alone in trying to own the education market — Google has offered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-trying-to-get-college-students-hooked-on-ai-with-a-free-year-of-gemini-advanced-195706467.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">aggressive discounts</a> on Gemini for students — but clearly it thinks appealing to teachers could help cement its position. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-made-a-free-version-of-chatgpt-for-teachers-202937994.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks.</p> 
<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support.</p> 
<p>Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger.</p> 
<p>There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Disney+ has Star Wars and Paramount+ has Star Trek, so it&#39;s about time Amazon gets its own sci-fi franchise with &quot;star&quot; in the title. Prime Video has just greenlit a TV revival of the iconic Stargate franchise, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/stargate-tv-series-order-amazon-martin-gero-1236623431/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Deadline</ins></em></a>. This will be the fourth major TV show in the series, following the first movie.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know anything about the plot and where it fits into the decades-long mythology but we do know that the showrunner is Martin Gero. He&#39;s a veteran of the IP, having cut his teeth in the industry while working on <em>Stargate: Atlantis</em> back in the early 2000s. He also created the show <em>Blindspot</em> and was showrunner on the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-nbc-considers-quantum-leap-for-peacock.html"><ins>recent reboot of </ins><em><ins>Quantum Leap</ins></em></a>, which was actually kind of nifty (RIP.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="441d604ee3ef4f6ba9c0f5b0aaa6e23a"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e82uV9sBt4I?si=I7pVVDLOGmBoL5Vn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Franchise creators Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are on board as executive producers, as are Brad Wright and Joe Mallozzi. That last duo were behind most of the Stargate TV projects, including the most recent live action show <em>Stargate Universe</em>.</p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense for Prime Video. Amazon did <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-mgm-acquisition-closed-135810387.html"><ins>recently buy MGM</ins></a>, after all, and the Stargate IP came along with that purchase. It&#39;s not the first time the platform will have dabbled with science fiction. Prime Video <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-20-amazon-the-expanse-season-four.html"><ins>most famously saved </ins><em><ins>The Expanse</ins></em></a> after it was originally cancelled by SyFy. There are three more books in that series that have yet to be adapted. Just saying.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, the Stargate franchise involves the titular Stargates. These are transportation devices created by ancient aliens that act as galaxy-spanning wormholes. It all started with a movie from 1994.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/stargate-is-coming-back-to-tv-thanks-to-prime-video-200049713.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bluesky is looking to make its moderation and reporting systems more transparent as part of its efforts to forge a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-experiments-with-dislikes-and-social-proximity-to-improve-conversations-205226194.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">healthier social media ecosystem</a> than some of the alternatives out there. The platform&#39;s userbase has doubled in size to 40 million over the past year, and with more users come <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/blueskys-2024-moderation-report-shows-how-quickly-harmful-content-grew-as-new-users-flocked-in-000149354.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">more instances of toxicity</a> and other types of harmful content. Bluesky is also subject to more regulatory requirements <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-blocks-mississippi-due-to-its-new-age-verification-law-133049512.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">in certain jurisdictions</a>. The team has been working to address those factors, and changes to the moderation system should help.</p><p>The platform is revamping how it enforces and tracks violations of its policies. In the latest version of the Bluesky app, the system for reporting posts now includes more granular options with specific options to flag content related to things like false information about elections, human trafficking and bullying. &quot;This granularity helps our moderation systems and teams act faster and with greater precision,&quot; the Bluesky team <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/11-19-2025-moderation-updates" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">wrote in a blog post</a>. &quot;It also allows for more accurate tracking of trends and harms across the network.&quot;</p><p>Rather than tracking community guidelines violations across individual policies as it did in the past, Bluesky will automatically track everything in a single system. As part of that, the platform will provide users clearer information about enforcement actions. Starting in the coming weeks, users whose accounts are actioned will learn which policy they violated, the severity level of their violation and how many times they’ve broken the rules. They&#39;ll also be notified as to the length and end date of any suspension, as well as how close they are to more severe penalties being applied to their account for repeated violations. There are appeals processes for both post takedowns and account suspensions.</p><p>Looking ahead, Bluesky plans to add a moderation inbox to the app rather than dealing with moderation decisions by email. The team says this will improve transparency and enable it to send a higher volume of notifications to users.</p><p>&quot;These updates are part of our broader work on community health,&quot; the team wrote. &quot;Our goal is to ensure consistent, fair enforcement that holds repeat violators accountable while serving our growing community as we continue to scale.&quot;</p><p>There are some other changes in the latest version of the app. The team says that a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3m5yqc2is5s2q" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">redesign</a> makes the &quot;who can reply&quot; settings easier to use, including the option to save your selection as the default for future posts.

But don&#39;t get too excited, as this is far from the level 4 autonomy that CEO Elon Musk envisions for the company&#39;s robotaxis.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/holiday-gemini-tips-new-explore-tab/">rolling out an update to Maps</a> that brings some new tools to the table, including the ability to check on EV charger availability. The app already showed the location of EV chargers, but not if they were available or not. In other words, it was entirely possible to roll up to a charging station only to find a line of EVs waiting for juice.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/c719f580-c578-11f0-be2b-22278d9511f3" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/c719f580-c578-11f0-be2b-22278d9511f3" style="height:780px;width:770px;" alt="The tool in action." data-uuid="be9dda36-4c09-3b47-8d60-210fabc79d3b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google </div></figure>
<p>The updated tool will soon show &quot;how many chargers will likely be available upon your arrival.&quot; This uses a combination of AI wizardry and real-time charger availability to predict how many chargers are likely to be open and ready for use at a particular point in time. Google says this will help users &quot;avoid lines and save time.&quot; The charger tracker drops next week, but only via Android Auto and cars with Google built-in.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Explore tab has gotten a revamp, making it easier to find curated lists from local influencers and companies like OpenTable. All you have to do is swipe up to see &quot;trending and popular restaurants, activities and sights near you.&quot; The updated Explore tab rolls out this month globally on both Android and iOS.</p>
<p>The company is also stuffing more Gemini into Maps because it&#39;s 2025 and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-maps-gemini-integration-will-make-hands-free-navigation-more-conversational-140009629.html">that&#39;s the way things are done now</a>. The AI chatbot will be able to whip up &quot;know before you go&quot; tips before visiting restaurants, hotels, concert venues and other locations of interest. Google says Gemini will be like &quot;having a knowledgeable guide show you the way.&quot; We&#39;ll have to see how that works out in real life. This AI-powered tips feature is already available for many users in the US on Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Finally, reviewers can now change their display names when providing feedback to local businesses. Google says this can be used to review nearby shops with names like &quot;Eager Elf&quot; or &quot;Julia Loves Sweets.&quot; Despite the user name change, it&#39;ll still be your Google account making the remark, so keep things polite.</p>
<p>This is just the latest update for Google Maps. The app is adding <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/google-maps-is-adding-live-lane-guidance-for-the-polestar-4-192705050.html">live lane guidance for Polestar 4 owners</a> and is also <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-maps-comes-to-garmin-smartwatches-160432725.html">coming to Garmin smartwatches</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-maps-will-use-ai-to-predict-if-ev-chargers-will-be-available-on-arrival-191808879.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If the idea of a custom-made &quot;previously on&quot; video for every show you watch is attractive to you, Amazon is taking steps to make it happen. The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/ai-plot-summary-video-recaps-prime-video" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that it&#39;ll now include AI-generated &quot;Video Recaps&quot; for select series on Prime Video so it&#39;s easier to hop back into a show after taking a break. The feature expands on text-based <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-will-now-use-ai-to-recap-what-youre-watching-194551857.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">X-Ray Recaps</a> the company started experimenting with in 2024, and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-will-use-ai-to-generate-recaps-for-book-series-on-the-kindle-170018503.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Kindle Recaps</a> it already offers for some series sold through the Kindle Store.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s Video Recaps combine clips, synchronized narration, select dialogue, music and sound effects into a short video that refreshes you on the characters and plot of a show. You can access the recaps through a new Recaps button on a show&#39;s page. Clicking it will either pull up a text-based X-Ray Recap or a Video Recap, depending on what Amazon&#39;s generated. At least for now, if you&#39;re interested in seeing a Video Recap for yourself, Amazon says the feature is available in beta for <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan</em>, <em>Upload</em>, <em>Bosch</em> and <em>The Rig</em>.</p><p>Recaps are essentially a repackaged version of the summarizing skill that companies have decided AI excels at. Amazon&#39;s Video Recaps are decidedly more complex than an email summary, but the basic premise is the same. Adding the feature to media apps and devices, as Amazon and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotify-is-adding-recaps-for-audiobooks-133000324.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Spotify</a> have done, seems like low-hanging fruit that other companies will pursue.&nbsp;</p><p>AI-generated recaps aren&#39;t without their detractors, though. Many indie authors <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-might-undermine-one-of-the-better-alternatives-to-the-kindle-123039955.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">were against</a> Kindle Recaps because of their potential to misrepresent the plots and characters of books. The same possibility could theoretically exist for Video Recaps, as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-adds-ai-generated-video-recaps-for-select-prime-video-shows-190758346.html?src=rss]]></description>

Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tools/compare/tcl-qm7k-vs-hisense-u75qg/88608/96104">some reviews</a> say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content <em>too</em> bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it&#39;s not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set.

That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room.

It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches.

Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out.</p>

It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.)</p> 
<p>If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sling TV has won the first stage of a legal battle with Disney over the short-term passes that the streaming service <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-tv-launches-a-5-day-pass-for-commitment-free-cable-150021645.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">introduced in August</a>. The Dish Network-owned platform started offering daily ($5), weekend ($10) and weekly ($15) passes for its Sling Orange plan, which costs $46 on a monthly basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Disney owns several channels that are offered through Sling TV platforms, including multiple ESPN channels and the Disney Channel. It did not take too kindly to the new offerings — Disney promptly filed a lawsuit over the short-term live TV passes, as well as an emergency request to halt them. As reported by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/sling-tv-wins-the-first-round-of-its-lawsuit-with-disney-sling-tv-celebrates-with-1-day-passes-for-espn/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Cord Cutters</em></a>, US District Judge Arun Subramanian dismissed the latter motion after determining Disney failed to demonstrate &quot;it would suffer irreparable harm&quot; without the court&#39;s immediate intervention.</p><p>“Disney hasn’t shown it has lost customers due to the passes,” Judge Subramanian wrote in an 11-page <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26287254-disney-vs-sling-denial/?mode=document&amp;q=siphon#document/p9" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ruling</a>, per <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/824017/disney-sling-tv-cable-passes-block-denied" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>The Verge</em></a>. “The networks are being distributed in the same platform, in the same manner, that they always have, but to a broader array of Sling customers.”</p><p>A viewer might not want to sign up to a streaming service for an entire month if they only want to watch a single game (say, a winner-take-all soccer match in which a team scores three utterly sensational goals to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nbcsports.com/soccer/news/scotland-stun-10-man-denmark-to-reach-first-world-cup-since-1998-kieran-tierney-the-hero-of-thriller" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">take their country to the men’s World Cup for the first time in 28 years</a>). However, Disney asserted that, under its agreement with Sling TV, the platform can only offer access to its channels to traditional subscribers. Under Disney&#39;s interpretation, those are consumers who have recurring monthly subscriptions.</p><p>Judge Subramanian disagreed, pointing out that the contract defines a subscriber as “a person intentionally authorized by Dish to receive any level of video programming service or package of programming networks via the Sling Platform.” The judge added that, as far as a &quot;subscriber&quot; goes, &quot;there’s no minimum subscription length or other terms specified&quot; and the term refers to anyone who is entitled to receive “any level of video programming service or package of programming networks.” Judge Subramanian argued that this &quot;broad definition clearly covers users of the passes at issue in this case.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Disney also claimed that the short-term passes would pull consumers away from its own standalone <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/espns-new-streaming-service-arrives-august-21-150026297.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">ESPN streaming service</a>. The company offered up evidence to that end, but Judge Subramanian wrote that the documentation &quot;doesn’t show that the passes siphon customers from ESPN Unlimited.” The judge added that, &quot;if the passes do siphon customers from ESPN Unlimited, Disney hasn’t shown that those losses would not be quantifiable.&quot;</p><p>While the short-term passes remain in place for now (with Sling TV offering $1 per day passes until November 30 to celebrate this initial victory), the breach-of-contract lawsuit Disney has filed will move forward. Judge Subramanian also pointed out that the current agreement between the two sides runs out within the next 12 months and they&#39;re set to start renegotiating terms soon. So, if Disney wants to prohibit the short-term passes or have its networks excluded from them, it can try to hash that out in contract talks.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-fails-in-initial-bid-to-halt-sling-tvs-short-term-streaming-passes-175000436.html?src=rss]]></description>

This comes just a day after the company brought the game back to life by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-buys-its-ip-from-riot-so-hytale-is-back-in-development-185040959.html"><ins>buying the rights back from Riot</ins></a>. In other words, this new footage is quite the flex.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that this isn&#39;t a AAA-style trailer. It&#39;s barely edited live footage from the game that was &quot;recorded in a single morning and put together&quot; by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme. The developer says there are no &quot;bells and whistles&quot; included with this footage, as it features &quot;just the game as it is.&quot; The description goes on to call the video &quot;raw and broken, but still beautiful.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="974bb3884889400f8f7648eb6538ddab"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhaqjb_S2X8?si=OTyXiYQ_JcOx_JY0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Hypixel says that this footage uses the original legacy engine which dates back to 2018. It&#39;s also running on a four-year-old build. Collins-Laflamme wrote that it was important to &quot;release raw footage today so we can break the curse once and for all.&quot;</p>
<p>As for that curse, <em>Hytale</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-and-ends-development-of-hytale-190435047.html"><ins>was recently canceled by Riot Games</ins></a> after nearly a decade of development. Just a few months later, the company managed to purchase the rights and get the game back on track. It also rehired around 30 staffers. The developer says &quot;there&#39;s a long road ahead, but early access is coming soon.&quot; We don&#39;t have a date on that early access build, but we sure do like the word &quot;soon.&quot;</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Hytale</em> is a fun-looking adventure game that looks like an open world take on <em>Minecraft</em>. Today&#39;s footage highlights some of the game&#39;s action and RPG mechanics, with a harrowing look at nighttime gameplay.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-shows-off-new-hytale-footage-the-day-after-it-brought-the-game-back-to-life-173159607.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>European policymakers have proposed sweeping changes to the way the EU regulates the tech industry. In just the last few months, the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-will-stop-running-political-ads-in-the-eu-162232948.html">Meta</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice-140741058.html">Google</a> have questioned strict EU policies relating to privacy and AI expansion, but if the European Commission’s new package of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2718">proposals</a> are passed, a number of big tech roadblocks will be removed. Or at least lifted up a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to rules around AI, cybersecurity and data will, according to policymakers, generate growth for European businesses, while &quot;promoting Europe’s highest standards of fundamental rights, data protection, safety and fairness.&quot; Among the proposals are amendments to the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">AI Act</a> that Google has recently expressed concerns about, which would allow AI companies to access shared personal data for training models.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also wants to simplify paperwork for smaller companies, and to make <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-talent-skills-and-literacy">AI literacy</a> a requirement for member states. AI oversight would also be centralized into the AI Office where general-purpose AI models are being used, a move intended to &quot;reduce governance fragmentation.&quot; In addition, strict rules around the use of AI in areas deemed to be high-risk, which were expected to come in next summer, could be delayed until the Commission confirms that &quot;the needed standards and support tools&quot; are available to affected companies.</p>
<p>The infamous (and admittedly very annoying) cookie banners that are foundational to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will also be rethought under the Commission’s proposals. If approved, people would see these banners pop up with less regularity, give their consent with one click, and save their cookie preferences so they presumably could be automatically applied within a browser.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s &quot;digital omnibus&quot; now goes to the European Parliament for approval, where it could face serious opposition. While the proposals are likely to be welcomed by the rapidly-growing AI industry, sceptics could argue that watered down privacy and AI legislation is evidence of Europe bowing to pressure from big tech and Donald Trump, who has publicly criticized the EU’s digital regulation.</p>
<p>This would represent a marked turnaround from the EU’s long-standing reputation as the tech industry’s most stubborn adversary. Back in September, it <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-tells-apple-it-has-no-intention-of-repealing-the-digital-markets-act-175950691.html">rejected</a> calls from Apple to repeal its Digital Markets Act (DMA), a legal framework that Apple has repeatedly been <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-app-store-rules-are-still-in-violation-of-eu-policy-161117662.html">accused</a> of violating by the EU. In the summer, Meta <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-app-store-rules-are-still-in-violation-of-eu-policy-161117662.html">refused</a> to sign the EU’s AI Code of Practice, with its global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, calling the code an “over-reach.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/european-policymakers-want-to-ease-ai-and-privacy-laws-171118149.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming.</p> 
<p>Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive.</p>

Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p>

<p>If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer.</p>

It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Porsche just revealed the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-cayenne-electric-technological-milestone-41128.html"><ins>long-awaited Cayenne Electric luxury SUV</ins></a>, which is being called the &quot;most powerful production Porsche of all time.&quot; The specs back this up, as the new Cayenne seems like an absolute beast.</p>
<p>It boasts up to 1,139hp of power, translating to 850kW. The vehicle can hit 162MPH and go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 2.4 seconds. The recently-released rear-wheel drive electric Taycan sedan <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-new-taycan-evs-have-more-range-faster-acceleration-and-a-higher-price-123514002.html"><ins>takes 4.5 seconds to reach 60 miles per hour</ins></a>. Of course, these specs vary depending on several configuration options.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="16ccaddbfcec4cb18ac5d9cb337f865a"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTHaoFDEVCo?si=G4gNVSQIFkXPUTvL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The EV Cayenne does include the company&#39;s &quot;push to pass&quot; button, which provides a ten second power boost. This adds approximately 173hp to let you squeeze past a slowpoke on the highway.</p>
<p>Porsche is also claiming that the Cayenne Electric is a towing powerhouse. The company says it can tow up to 3.5 tons, which works out to over 7,700 pounds, when properly equipped. That&#39;s an absolutely insane metric, as 3.5 tons is heavier than a modern pickup truck with all possible bells and whistles.</p>
<p>This is an EV so we gotta get into charging. Porsche says it features up to 400kW of charging power under ideal conditions, which should let it go from 10 to 80 percent in under 20 minutes. It&#39;s also the first electric Porsche to support inductive charging. The vehicle will come equipped with a Tesla Supercharger/NACS fast-charging port on the driver side and a CCS/AC port on the passenger side.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the first EV SUV to get the company&#39;s Active Ride technology. This is the hydraulic suspension system found on the Taycan and Panamera.</p>
<p>As for the interior, you can&#39;t miss the unique bending screen. This is called the Flow Display, and it&#39;s a vertically-installed screen in the center that curves toward the bottom. It&#39;s the largest display ever in a Porsche and will run on the company&#39;s brand-new OS. We don&#39;t have actual measurements for this display, but we do know that it&#39;s bookended by a separate 14.25-inch OLED instrument cluster. There&#39;s also an optional passenger display.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/260ad150-c564-11f0-bdf3-8973e72d2401" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/260ad150-c564-11f0-bdf3-8973e72d2401" style="height:1150px;width:2052px;" alt="Some rich dude fiddling with a display." data-uuid="3264b15a-b116-3bd1-83f7-83a336a56dac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Porsche</div></figure>
<p>The OS includes a new AI-powered voice assistant. Porsche says this system can understand complex instructions and take actions accordingly. We&#39;ll have to see how that works out in the real world. Porsche says the assistant can adjust climate controls, seat heating and ambient lighting, while also taking stuff like traffic and local points of interest into account.</p>
<p>Now onto the bad news. This is a Porsche so the new Cayenne will absolutely demolish any and all bank accounts. The standard version starts at $111,000, while the Cayenne Turbo Electric starts at $165,350. Preorders are open right now, with customer deliveries expected in the summer.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/porsche-has-electrified-the-cayenne-and-its-a-beast-163443958.html?src=rss]]></description>

Anker deserves a little extra attention, after all. The brand makes some of our favorite accessories for keeping phones, tablets and computers charged up and connected. These devices earn high marks in our testing and we recommend them in our guides to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html">wireless chargers</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">MagSafe power banks</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html">iPad accessories</a> and more.

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals">Best Black Friday Anker deals&nbsp;</h2> 
<p>This first deal, the Anker Laptop Power Bank, is one of my personal favorite Anker products — and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-laptop-power-bank-review-all-my-favorite-battery-features-together-at-last-130036854.html">in my opinion</a>, the best portable charger, period. One of our top wireless chargers is on sale, too, as well as our <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-webcams-123047068.html">budget pick for a web cam</a>.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-are-ready-to-shop-now-ahead-of-the-years-biggest-sale-100052033.html?src=rss]]></description>

But if you&#39;ve beaten it and are already itching to jump back in, it might be best to wait until at least November 24 to do so. That&#39;s when developer Sucker Punch will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">release an update</a> that will introduce a bunch of new features to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-sold-842-million-playstation-5s-since-launch-123004469.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the PS5 title</a>, including a New Game+ mode.&nbsp;</p><p>That means you&#39;ll be able to experience Atsu&#39;s mission for revenge from the beginning again with all of the weapons, abilities and armor sets you unlocked from your first playthrough. Those early-game enemies are about to feel the wrath of many a flaming kusarigama.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll need to finish the main story before you can unlock New Game+, which includes tougher difficulty options and a pair of new trophies to snag. The free update will introduce extra upgrades for existing weapons and armor sets, along with a new ghost flowers currency that you can swap for fresh armor sets, weapon dyes and charms while playing New Game+.</p><p>There are a number of features coming to the base game as well (i.e. for all players, not just those who dip into New Game+). Directional button remapping is one of several new accessibility options. Photo Mode will gain new filters, a shutter speed tool and a composition grid. Also, after you&#39;ve beaten the main story, you&#39;ll be able to replay missions and quests. With a new stats display, you&#39;ll be able to see how long it took you to win a given duel, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>isn&#39;t getting an expansion quite yet.

<p>This particular model easily made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

<p>We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark.</p> 
<p>The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn&#39;t just for Nintendo&#39;s latest console. It&#39;ll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have to give <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/porsche-911-gts-review-the-first-hybrid-911-is-better-with-a-battery-120038613.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Porsche</a> credit for going in early on EVs. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-new-taycan-evs-have-more-range-faster-acceleration-and-a-higher-price-123514002.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Taycan</a> is a stellar sedan/wagon that&#39;s only gotten better. But even for a niche manufacturer like Porsche, it&#39;s not exactly a mass-market machine. To really move the needle on EVs, you need something more family friendly, and for the brand from Stuttgart, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/porsches-all-electric-macan-suv-boasts-a-381-mile-range-and-up-to-621hp-163940921.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">that&#39;s the Macan</a>.</p>
<p>Porsche&#39;s gas-powered crossover SUV is its best-selling machine in the US, so it&#39;s an absolutely vital piece of the company&#39;s success. It&#39;s also Porsche&#39;s second full-on, battery-powered machine to hit the market. The Macan Electric doesn&#39;t replace its internal combustion predecessor, rather living alongside it on the dealership floor, creating a brutal sibling rivalry and a potentially difficult choice for buyers: gas or electric?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, Porsche made it a pretty easy decision. This is the right one.</p>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="8707b546-3f56-4560-81b4-a309ef2c4d22" data-original-url="https://models.porsche.com/en-US/model-start/macan"></core-commerce></p>
<h2 id="d3922d4d-b1dd-4319-8f38-1e5745baee3a">Hardware tour</h2>
<p>The Macan Electric shares a silhouette and a segment with that other Macan, but from a technology standpoint, there&#39;s little the two agree upon. The Macan Electric is built on a new platform called PPE, which at one point was destined to be the underpinnings of a smorgasbord of electrified offerings from both <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-10-porsche-and-audi-will-share-electric-car-platform.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Porsche and Audi</a>, including the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audi-unveils-its-latest-ev-concept-vehicle-ahead-of-auto-shanghai-2021-050009357.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">A6 E-Tron</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-audi-q6-e-tron-is-an-oled-dream-machine-140018286.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Q6 E-Tron</a>.</p>
<p>For now, at least, Americans&#39; increasingly fickle attitudes toward EVs have stymied some of those plans, meaning this Macan and the upcoming Cayenne Electric are the only two Porsches built from those bones. The Macan is the smaller of the two, powered by a variety of different configurations, starting with a single-motor, rear-drive configuration with 355 horsepower on the low end, up to the 630-hp, dual-motor Macan Turbo Electric on the high end. Buyers can also select the dual-motor Macan 4 Electric, speedier 4S Electric or quicker still GTS Electric.</p>
<p>I tested a base Macan Electric, its rear-mounted, 355-hp motor enough to scoot this 5,004-pound SUV from zero to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. The top-shelf Macan Turbo Electric gets to 60 in 3.1 seconds, absolutely humiliating the quickest exhaust-spewing Macan GTS&#39;s 4.3-second time.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a Porsche, not a drag machine, and so cornering is key. Helping with the handling is an adaptive air suspension that not only lets you go from stiff to firm at the twist of a knob but also raises or lowers dynamically. When you&#39;re hunting for range or speed, the SUV gets down into an aerodynamic tuck low to the earth. If you&#39;re looking to head off-road, it&#39;ll hike itself up by 1.6 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I wouldn&#39;t consider this an off-roader as such, the dual motor configurations should be competent in lower-grip situations. Open differentials at either end will keep your all-roading aspirations limited, but on some icy, slippery roads during the week I spent living with one, even the rear-drive Macan proved sure-footed and easy to handle, despite its summer-oriented Pilot Sport EV tires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of all that is a 100-kilowatt-hour battery, which offers the Macan Electric an EPA-rated range of up to 315 miles, depending on which trim you go with. In my testing, which included extended periods of driving with my foot flat to the floor, I managed 2.8 miles per kWh. That&#39;s a theoretical maximum range of 280 miles if you&#39;re driving like you stole it. Anyone doing the school run in a more sedate way will have no problem meeting or beating that EPA rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond performance, the Macan Electric has another advantage over its internal combustion counterpart: it has a more modern interior. The highlight is the 12.6-inch, curved gauge cluster. Using buttons on the steering wheel, you can cycle through various views and telemetry elements to suit your desire for data or need to remain undisturbed.</p>
<p>That&#39;s paired with a 10.9-inch touchscreen in the middle, and you can even opt for a third display embedded way over on the right side of the dashboard. This one allows you to access streaming services like YouTube. I&#39;ve never seen the point in that, though, but that&#39;s only because I&#39;ve yet to meet a passenger who wouldn&#39;t rather just use their smartphone.</p>
<p>Porsche&#39;s PCM interface on that central touchscreen is simple and clean, with more than a passing iOS resemblance. Perhaps that&#39;s why the company has been an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/aston-martin-and-porsche-showed-off-next-generation-apple-carplay-coming-to-their-cars-in-2024-220130805.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">early adopter of CarPlay Ultra</a>. For the Android faithful, wireless Android Auto is here too, and it works great, looking nearly native on the widescreen display.</p>

<p>Through simple menus, you can do everything from track lap times to enable or disable the augmented digital engine tone, which Porsche calls Electronic Sport Sound. I confess the futuristic whirring and whooshing does make driving aggressively a bit more fun, but most of the time I prefer to have it off.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not everything is controlled through the touchscreen. There&#39;s a separate, capacitive-touch panel just below it for climate-related functions, including toggling the prodigiously warm heated seats (which I&#39;m enjoying as I write this). You&#39;ll find a physical volume knob there, too.</p>
<p>The Macan seats five comfortably, though I&#39;d stick to four for anything longer than a quick run to a team lunch. Front and rear seats are comfortable, and there&#39;s a tolerable amount of legroom in the back. Headroom back there, though, is limited. If you have tall co-workers, they&#39;ll be tripping over each other to call shotgun.</p>

<p>In the grand spectrum of SUVs on the roads today, the 188.3-inch-long Macan Electric is on the smaller side. But, as an EV, it&#39;s heavy for a crossover. At just a tick over 5,000 pounds, it&#39;s a substantial 850 pounds heavier than a regular base Macan.</p>
<p>Porsche&#39;s engineers addressed that as best they could with the aforementioned fancy suspension, plus larger, 20-inch wheels on each corner. The result is an SUV that is, in Sport or Sport Plus modes, remarkably fun to drive. Its steering is extremely quick for an SUV, which makes this thing feel lighter than it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the grip provided by those tires and suspension really gives you the confidence to push through the corners, too. And, when you push too hard, it breaks away quickly and predictably. I enjoyed romping on the throttle hard mid-corner to kick the tail out, the Macan giving me just enough time to grin and give a bit of a steering correction before everything was right and the tires were stuck again.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a sports car, no doubt about that, and it tends to wallow a bit on bumpy roads thanks to all that weight, but it is far more engaging and fun than just about anything else in this category. Even this base model is quick off the line, but its breakneck initial throttle response is tempered by a somewhat flat acceleration at higher speeds. It just doesn&#39;t have the kind of Autobahn-dominating top-end that Porsches are typically known for.</p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;d have to cough up the extra $10,000 for the GTS, or a further $20,000 for the $109,000 Turbo if I really wanted that. Yes, these things get expensive quick. The base Macan Electric I drove started at $73,500, but carried enough options to drive its out-the-door price to $86,865.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are, at least, getting a machine that readily does double-duty. Despite its responsiveness and eager handling, the Macan Electric does a stellar job of settling down when you twist that Drive Mode knob on the steering wheel to the left, unwinding the suspension and relaxing the experience. The SUV manages excellent compliance over broken roads, flying over railroad tracks without complaint, and just generally being a calm and competent cruiser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&#39;s one, undeniable flaw that drove me absolutely nuts in the Macan Electric: a complete lack of lift-off regenerative braking. Porsche continues its adamant refusal to offer anything even approaching a one-pedal driving experience. That&#39;s a frustrating thing to me — maybe not quite as frustrating as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-phasing-out-apple-carplay-and-android-auto-in-evs-163104494.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">GM phasing out Android Auto and Apple CarPlay</a>, but pretty close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After driving a few different prototypes of the Macan Electric during its development phase, I very much enjoyed my time with a final, production version on some familiar roads around my home. It excelled in the dry and on slippery, early winter roads, made me smile when I was feeling rowdy, and then disappeared into the background when I just wanted to get home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn&#39;t a perfect machine. I&#39;d hoped for a little more roominess inside, I lament the lack of one-pedal driving, and honestly, I wish Porsche&#39;s exterior designers had gone a little crazier. At a quick glance, it looks a lot like a first-gen <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-updated-model-y-performance-launches-for-57490-123018911.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Tesla Model Y</a>, especially in Gentian Blue Metallic, which is a dead ringer for Tesla&#39;s Deep Blue Metallic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there&#39;s also the significant premium that you&#39;ll have to pay to get into one: $10,000 over a base, gas-powered Macan. For that, you&#39;re getting a lot of extra performance, a dose of extra tech and all the joys and simplicities that come with living the EV lifestyle. That makes it well worth it in my book.</p>

Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t <em>entirely </em>baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It&#39;s something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>
<p>Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html">VPN deal</a> this year, of course.

CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.</p></li>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unity and Epic Games, the creators of today’s biggest video game engines, have announced a partnership that will make Unity games available in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/fortnite-is-finally-back-in-the-us-app-store-222946133.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Epic has allowed creators to publish their own experiences (or “islands”) within <em>Fortnite</em> since 2018, and the number of experiences has grown considerably over the recent years. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2024</a>, 198,000 islands were published within the game, double the number from the previous year. This partnership has the potential to grow <em>Fortnite</em> experiences even further by welcoming Unity developers and can give existing developers more freedom. </p><p>“Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” said Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, in a statement. “Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success.” Sweeney announced the partnership with Unity CEO Matt Bromberg at Unity’s annual developer conference. They said that developers will be able to publish games that use Unity’s game engine on <em>Fortnite</em> sometime next year. The companies promised to announce more details and exact timing in the future. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just announced at Unity’s Unite 2025 show in Barcelona: Unity has built an amazing new networking protocol enabling Unity games to come into Fortnite next year.

The dashboard allows developers to manage pricing and promotions across websites and stores for mobile and PC from one place. It will start supporting Unreal Engine in early 2026. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/unity-games-are-coming-to-fortnite-133000076.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>We consider this to be the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html">best budget Apple Watch</a>, and arguably the best smartwatch for folks who have never owned one before. The latest version runs on the same chipset found in the new flagship models, and it has most of the same fitness and workout tracking features you&#39;ll find in those more expensive devices as well.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The SE 3 also now has an always-on display, making it easier to glance down throughout the day to check the time or see activity stats without moving your wrist, and fast-charging support makes it a more viable sleep tracker. Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight.</p>

This is a smarter and more conversational version of the iconic smart assistant. Like most modern AI products, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">it&#39;s still working out some bugs</a>.

<p>The speaker is decent enough for the size, though you won&#39;t be using it to fuel any house parties. It&#39;s a great tool for bedroom-based listening. This version doesn&#39;t have a camera, which is actually great news for the privacy conscious.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazons-echo-spot-smart-speaker-drops-to-50-for-black-friday-130550875.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You probably haven&#39;t heard of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.read.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Read AI</a>. The company has quietly been making a name for itself in the crowded AI space, signing up 50,000 customers daily in recent months. At first glance, Read AI resembles apps like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Otter.ai" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">Otter.ai</a>. You can use the software to transcribe and summarize meetings, but it&#39;s also more ambitious than that.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s AI on standby,&quot; Read AI CEO David Shim explains, adding that the company&#39;s vision is to give people a tool that can record, transcribe and analyze nearly every professional conversation they have, no matter where those discussions take place and whether they occur online or in-person. Today, Read AI is taking a major step toward realizing that vision with the release of its new Operator agent (I&#39;ll admit, the company could have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-operator-can-surf-the-web-for-you-210029243.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">picked a more original name</a>), and new apps for Windows, macOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><p>Between its own software, including an existing iOS app, and third-party integrations, Read AI users can now connect their accounts to more than 22 other platforms. Some of the more notable inclusions there are Gmail, Outlook, Slack, HubSpot and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/notion-mail-is-a-powerful-but-lightweight-email-client-for-busy-people-150007543.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Notion</a>. More importantly, with Read AI&#39;s mobile apps, you can record impromptu in-person meetings; the company has data showing that more than half of professional conversations occur outside of online spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSDdypg5_Nc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In any case, no matter where you talk to your colleagues, Operator is there to generate notes and insights. &quot;We don&#39;t just look at meetings,&quot; Shim says. &quot;We look at topics that are interesting to you.” To that end, Read AI has built a series of in-house multimodal models that look for context beyond what&#39;s said during any interaction you record. For example, the company&#39;s systems are designed to catch when you enthusiastically answer a question or look away in disinterest, and use that data to decide how the software goes about summarizing your meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;That context is what enables us to identify what is valuable to you, and make that discoverable,&quot; says Shim. One way Read AI will surface those insights is through a feature the company calls Monday Brief. At the start of every week, you&#39;ll get a summary of all the calls and conversations you had over the last seven days, with suggestions for follow-up actions you can take.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering, like I was, how Read AI hopes to compete in a market where a company like Microsoft is aggressively pushing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Copilot</a> on its users. If Shim is worried about the big players, he doesn&#39;t show it. &quot;There&#39;s a need for an independent third party,&quot; he says. &quot;There&#39;s always something new coming out. And that ability to be the independent third-party that plugs into different solutions is actually what consumers want and need.&quot; To his point, since the launch of Copilot two years ago, Read AI has seen a 20x increase in the daily number of people using its software alongside Microsoft Teams. &quot;We&#39;ve seen the same thing along those lines for Zoom and Google Meet.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He believes the company&#39;s approach to data privacy is another differentiator. By default, users are opted out of their data being used for training Read AI&#39;s future models. Shim also notes the company takes recording disclosure seriously. &quot;You need to notify people that you&#39;re [recording] a call, and we put that front and center every single time.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to try Read AI, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.read.ai/plans-pricing" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">offers a free plan</a> that includes five meeting transcripts per month. Pricing for its paid subscriptions start at $19.75 per month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/read-ai-is-building-a-note-taking-app-that-works-nearly-anywhere-130000235.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter.</p> 
<p>The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle.</p>

That&#39;s $100 less than its previous all-time low and the cheapest we&#39;ve seen it.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="50acc72050014effb9daf30e33218e83" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/robot/360-vis-nav/blue-nickel"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">one of the strongest in the category</a>. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we&#39;ve tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you&#39;ll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture.

Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn&#39;t offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it&#39;s not for you.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deal-get-half-off-our-favorite-budgeting-app-right-now-160025481.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Meta announced last year that it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-entering-its-post-truth-era-on-monday-202858791.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">was ditching</a> third-party fact checkers in favor of an X-style Community Notes system, the company was careful to note that it would only implement the changes within the United States to start. Now, nearly a year later, the social media company is getting ready to expand the crowd-sourced fact checks to more countries, and is asking the Oversight Board for advice on a potential rollout.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has requested that board weigh in on &quot;factors we should consider when deciding which countries, if any, to omit from the international roll out&quot; of Community Notes. Notably, Meta isn&#39;t asking the Oversight Board to advise on the merits of replacing traditional fact-checking organizations. Instead, the company wants guidance on how to approach country-specific challenges and whether there should be any carveouts.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We respectfully ask the Board to focus its examination on the country-level factors relevant to omitting countries from the international roll-out, and not on topics such as general product design or the operation of the Community Notes algorithm,&quot; the company wrote in its request shared by the board.&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, Meta has been experimenting with Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram and Threads in the United States only. People who want to be able to author notes still need to be approved, but the company allows anyone<a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://v" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"> to rate</a> notes. However, it seems that the feature so far hasn&#39;t gained as much traction for Meta as it has on X. In September, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/guyro/status/1965800300557857053" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">company said</a> that just 6 percent of the more than 15,000 notes that had been contributed had actually been published.&nbsp;By the end of the month, the number of published notes had risen to over 2,000, according to Meta. More than 90,000 people have signed on as contributors. </p><p>In a statement from the Oversight Board, the group said it would consider issues like whether a crowd-sourced fact checking system would make sense in countries with &quot;low levels of freedom of expression&quot; or without a free press, as well as places with &quot;low levels of digital literacy.&quot; It also said it was hoping to hear public comments from researchers who have studied different approaches to countering misinformation.</p><p>Unlike with a typical case from the Oversight Board, which deals with specific content moderation decisions, Meta has no obligation to implement any of the group&#39;s recommendations. But, the company has previously chosen to follow its suggestions in previous policy advisory opinions, including its decision <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-rolls-back-covid-19-misinformation-rules-in-many-countries-174746077.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">to roll back</a> COVID-19 misinformation rules following <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/oversight-board-asks-meta-to-reassess-what-covid-19-misinformation-it-removes-120032687.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a recommendation</a> from the board.</p><p><strong>Update, November 19, 2025, 9:15AM PT:</strong> Added additional stats about Community Notes adoption. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-asks-the-oversight-board-to-weigh-in-a-little-on-community-notes-ahead-of-expansion-110000208.html?src=rss]]></description>

In their early years, you&#39;d have to dish out $500 or more to get a decent robot vacuum, but that&#39;s not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth with mopping features, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine.<br><br>Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker to do one of your least favorite chores (and do it pretty well) by spending $300, or less in some instances. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do, like self-emptying capabilities or advanced dirt detection.

<h2 id="jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h2> 
<p>Since I&#39;ve tested dozens of robot vacuums, I&#39;m often asked if these gadgets are &quot;worth it&quot; and I&#39;d say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like a self-empty station to further reduce maintenance.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty station, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair.</p> 
<p>When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-budget-robot-vacuum">What to look for in a budget robot vacuum</h2> 
<p>When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums.</p> 
<p>So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you&#39;re dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance.</p> 
<p>You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range.</p> 
<p>Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it.</p> 
<p>You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules.</p> 
<p>But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option.</p> 
<p>Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums">How we test robot vacuums</h2> 
<p>When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more.</p> 
<p>Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> 
<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it&#39;s ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides.</p> 
<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean.</p> 
<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B016UG1YVQ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbia_CCrFkNcgJ0zQ7ebgrU4mGP5Uw4OzoYjaSwMhcJw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fclean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning%2Fdp%2FB016UG1YVQ%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/clean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning/dp/B016UG1YVQ/">Amazon</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;itemId=walmart_transaction_121788585&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9pcC9OZXV0b3AtSEVQQS1GaWx0ZXItUmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS1pUm9ib3QtUm9vbWJhLTgwMC05MDAtU2VyaWVzLTg1MC04NjAtODcwLTg3Ny04ODAtODkwLTg5MS04MDEtODA1LTk2MC05ODAtOTgxLTk4NS1Sb2JvdC1WYWN1dW1zLTktUGFjay8xMjE3ODg1ODU_ZnJvbT0vc2VhcmNoIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWZlNzAwMy0wZjA2LTQ5ZGQtYmY3NS02NTBmYjgxYzIyMmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL2lwL05ldXRvcC1IRVBBLUZpbHRlci1SZXBsYWNlbWVudC1Db21wYXRpYmxlLWlSb2JvdC1Sb29tYmEtODAwLTkwMC1TZXJpZXMtODUwLTg2MC04NzAtODc3LTg4MC04OTAtODkxLTgwMS04MDUtOTYwLTk4MC05ODEtOTg1LVJvYm90LVZhY3V1bXMtOS1QYWNrLzEyMTc4ODU4NT9mcm9tPS9zZWFyY2gifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR0fvhpjAgri6zot6u_Z0ys9xKbrrvArCJmjNE70pBiJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNeutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack%2F121788585%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Neutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack/121788585?from=/search">Walmart</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-are-budget-robot-vacuums-good-for-pet-hair">Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair?</h3> 
<p>Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html">cordless vacuum</a> since those tend to be more powerful overall.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-budget-robot-vacuums-last-per-charge">How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge?</h3> 
<p>Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-budget-robot-vacuums-work-on-carpets-and-hardwood-floors">Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors?</h3> 
<p>Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-budget-robot-vacuums-have-mapping-features">Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features?</h3> 
<p>Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you&#39;re thinking of buying and look for &quot;smart mapping&quot; or &quot;smart home mapping&quot; in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.</p>

If you’re just looking to hit 60 fps to 120 fps of performance, or you just want to play the latest games without cranking up your graphics settings, these are the notebooks to consider. You’ll still find high refresh rate displays, as well as modern CPUs and GPUs. Just be prepared to live with slightly flimsier build quality, as well as plastic cases.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-a-budget-gaming-laptop">What is a budget gaming laptop?</h2> 
<p>To get a high-end gaming experience, you can easily spend $5,000 on a fully tricked-out notebook like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-blade-18-2025-review-an-18-inch-gaming-laptop-that-does-the-most-153000136.html">Razer Blade 18</a>. But when it comes to the best budget gaming laptops, we&#39;re focusing on the other end of the pricing spectrum: laptops under $1,000. Rising prices due to tariffs and a more chaotic economy has made it tougher to find these inexpensive gems, but they’re still around if you look hard enough.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Stepping up a bit to systems between $1,400 and $2,000 puts you firmly in mid-range territory, which is beyond the scope of this guide. Still, it&#39;s worth keeping an eye out for sales that can push those higher-end models below $1,000. Be sure to check out our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">best gaming laptops</a> for a general overview of what to look out for in these more expensive systems.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-are-cheap-gaming-laptops-worth-it">Are cheap gaming laptops worth it?</h2> 
<p>Cheap gaming laptops are definitely worth it if you’re trying to save money and are being realistic about what you can get at this price range. You can expect to find Intel and AMD&#39;s latest (but not greatest) CPUs, as well as entry-level GPUs like NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 4050. Budget models are also typically paired with FHD (1080p) screens running at a respectably high refresh rate of 120Hz or beyond — ensuring smooth frame rates in your favorite games. You’ll occasionally see some 16-inch budget options, like Alienware’s Aurora 16 when it dips below $1,000 on sale.</p> 
<p>Many cheap gaming laptops also skimp on specs like RAM and hard drive space. We&#39;d recommend getting at least 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage at a minimum. Modern games need a decent chunk of memory to run, and they also tend to be large, so you wouldn&#39;t be able to fit much alongside Windows 11 on a 256B SSD. You might be tempted to jump on one of those dirt-cheap gaming laptop deals from Walmart or Best Buy, but it&#39;s just not worth it if you&#39;re stuck with 8GB of RAM or a tiny SSD. You can’t upgrade those components down the line, which gives super-cheap laptops a short lifespan.</p> 
<p>As for build quality, expect to find more plastic than metal on budget gaming machines. Still, the best budget gaming laptops we&#39;re recommending should be sturdy enough to last a few years. Affordable systems will also be heavier and thicker than mid-range and higher-end models, and often don’t have the best Wi-Fi or connectivity options. Battery life is another trade-off, though even the most expensive gaming laptops can struggle with longevity.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-gaming-laptop-130004199.html?src=rss]]></description>
