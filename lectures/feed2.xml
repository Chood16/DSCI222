                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mario Kart World received a free <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/free-update-for-mario-kart-world-lets-you-race-as-a-team-in-knockout-tour/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">update</a> today that brings a team option to its Knockout Tour mode. Initially, the Knockout races in this Nintendo Switch 2 launch title were only for solo drivers, challenging players to finish ahead of enough other competitors or get eliminated from the series. It was one of the highlights of the game in our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-perfect-launch-game-for-the-switch-2-130003924.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">review</a>, and this new wrinkle should bring plenty more fun chaos to the racetrack.</p><p>In the team mode, players compete either in two teams of twelve, three teams of eight or four teams of six. If you don&#39;t have enough people to fill out a team CPU drivers will complete the roster. You’ll still progress or be knocked out based on individual performance, but your score will be pooled with your teammates’ results. More points are awarded for placing highly in a race, with 50 going to the top finisher while drivers who don’t advance to the next course only get one. Eliminated drivers can continue to spectate the game and cheer on their teammates. Team play can be hosted via local wireless or online play. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-adds-a-team-option-in-knockout-tour-190348248.html?src=rss]]></description>

The game will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">arrive</a> on Xbox Series X/S, PC and Xbox Cloud on May 19, with an early access period commencing on May 15. That lines up with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">earlier reports</a> about the release date(s) after an in-game ad supposedly appeared in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>. The upcoming title will hit PS5 later this year.</p><p>The standard edition of <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">expected</a> to cost $70, though it will be on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. To jump in a few days early, you’ll need the premium edition (a deluxe edition will be available too).</p><p>Playground Games and co-developer Turn 10 Studios offered a first look at gameplay during Thursday’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-developer-direct-2026-how-to-watch-and-what-we-expect-to-see-from-fable-forza-horizon-6-and-beast-of-reincarnation-161000242.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Xbox Developer Direct showcase</a>. You’ll start out by working through Horizon qualifiers in order to join the Horizon Festival racing circuit, then you’ll unlock faster cars and other goodies as you rise up through the ranks. In a few feature called Horizon Rush, you’ll take on obstacle courses. </p><p>Playground says this is the largest Forza Horizon game to date. This version of Tokyo, for instance, is said to be five times larger than any urban area the studio has built before and it has multiple districts. There are lots of rural areas in the game as well, and the environments are affected by seasonal changes. As has been the case in previous games, you’ll be able to explore the world as you wish, either solo or with your friends.</p><p>There will be more than 550 cars available at the jump, and you’ll be able to apply liveries to their windows. Each player house has a customizable garage. You can build up a part of the world called The Estate as you see fit and your friends can visit to see what you’ve made (building will be available in multiplayer for the first time in the series too). There are also new open-world car meets where you can show off your whips, buy copies of other players’ rides and download more songs.</p><p>Playground is including all of the accessibility features from previous games. It’s adding new ones as well, such as a customizable high-contrast mode and an autodrive option.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/forza-horizon-6-will-hit-xbox-series-xs-and-pc-on-may-19-183242726.html?src=rss]]></description>

But while many Apple rumors conjure up an air of excitement, the notion of an Apple AI pin sounds downright baffling. Worse, it just seems desperate.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple, the company known for taking its time to jump into new categories with more thoughtful solutions than its competitors, is reportedly chasing the specter of OpenAI&#39;s unreleased AI pin. Never mind that OpenAI has never actually produced any hardware, and that it arguably stumbled into its position as a leading AI player. And never mind that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Humane&#39;s AI pin was a notorious failure</a> that barely worked, and seemed pointless from the start.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JjInHnLmGI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Sure, Apple doesn&#39;t want more AI eggs on its face, after the delay of its Siri revamp and the underwhelming (and error-prone) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/to-fix-apple-intelligence-apple-needs-to-be-honest-about-its-capabilities-130046256.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">debut of Apple Intelligence</a>. Beyond OpenAI, there&#39;s also competition from Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban smart glasses, which lean heavily on the company’s AI. There’s also the looming threat of whatever AI hardware Meta is cooking up next, following the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">layoffs from its virtual reality division</a>. And while Google doesn’t have much to show from its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-xr-glasses-hands-on-lightweight-but-with-a-limited-field-of-view-213940554.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Android XR platform</a>, which aims to bring its Gemini AI to your face, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Samsung’s Galaxy XR</a> is a start. We’ve also recently seen compelling demos of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/heres-how-google-is-laying-the-foundation-for-our-mixed-reality-future-180000716.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Google’s AR glasses prototypes and Xreal’s Project Aura glasses</a>.</p><p></p><p>If Apple&#39;s AI pin serves as a conduit to Siri, is it really that much more convenient than using an iPhone, AirPods or even an Apple Watch to do the same? The company has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/apple-plans-glasses-for-2026-as-part-of-ai-push-nixes-watch-with-camera?embedded-checkout=true" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">reportedly nixed plans</a> to put cameras in the Apple Watch, and <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests it’s opting instead to focus on delivering its own smart glasses this year. But it’s not hard to imagine that faster hardware could let the Apple Watch handle more Siri and AI-related tasks on its own. It’s already a fairly self-sufficient device, allowing you to ask basic Siri queries, run apps and listen to music without an iPhone — the cellular models are even more capable since they can take calls and send messages.</p><p>Rumors also point to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/12/airpods-pro-4-airpods-5-rumored-to-get-apple-intelligence-enhanced-cameras-in-2026#:~:text=AirPods%20Pro%204%2C%20AirPods%205,Intelligence%2Denhanced%20cameras%20in%202026&amp;text=Apple&#39;s%20plans%20for%20the%20next,iPhones%20or%20Apple%20Vision%20Pro." data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">infrared cameras coming to the next AirPods and AirPod Pros</a>. Instead of taking photos, they could enable hand gestures and environmental awareness, which might be useful for Apple Intelligence down the line. The addition of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-use-the-airpods-pro-3s-heart-rate-tracking-feature-141510469.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">heart rate tracking in the AirPods Pro 3</a> shows that there are still new features Apple can bring to its buds, beyond listening to music.</p><p>At best, an Apple AI pin could just be a simple way for someone to access Siri if they don’t want to wear an Apple Watch, plug in AirPods or have their iPhone within shouting distance. But at least those devices <em>do other things</em> beyond talking to Siri. The same is true for Meta’s Ray-Bans and future smart glasses. Even without accessing AI, they’ll still let you listen to music, take calls and, well, <em>be glasses</em> for those who need prescription frames.</p><p>Given the vocal pushback against <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/27/gen-z-smart-glasses-digital-privacy-consent/" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>, which are also being <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-can-no-longer-wear-xreal-or-metas-smart-glasses-in-public-on-this-cruise-ship" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">banned on cruises</a>, clubs and other venues, I&#39;m also not convinced many people would be eager to prominently display a surveillance device throughout the day. <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fc65353f-45dc-4cd0-89be-ac2071680abb&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6a9c4806-23e0-4b7e-8496-a6afa6f6c483&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=WIRED&amp;linkText=Wired%E2%80%99s+Julian+Chokkattu+was+questioned&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vcmV2aWV3L2h1bWFuZS1haS1waW4vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2YTljNDgwNi0yM2UwLTRiN2UtODQ5Ni1hNmFmYTZmNmM0ODMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvaHVtYW5lLWFpLXBpbi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeECur4vIAclexvrByd8h2ampdv3Pn5Fj3822SEo2aBG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Freview%2Fhumane-ai-pin%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:WIRED;elmt:;cpos:16;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.wired.com/review/humane-ai-pin/"><em>Wired’s</em> Julian Chokkattu was questioned</a> about wearing a camera while he was testing the Humane AI Pin, and I’ve also had to explain to curious people why I was wearing Xreal’s smart glasses, which feature a prominent camera accessory.</p><p>Sure, we&#39;re already living in a panopticon of smartphone cameras, but it&#39;s also obvious when someone is using their phone to capture photos and video. An AI pin just dangling off of your clothes is a constant threat, an unblinking eye. Even if Apple implements some sort of capture notification, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx23ke7rm7go" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">someone will always try to circumvent it</a>.</p><p>While <em>The Information</em> notes Apple&#39;s AI pin may never actually see the light of day, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it does. This is the company that partnered with OpenAI just to make Siri appear <em>slightly</em> smarter with the debut of Apple Intelligence. And instead of building its own home-brewed AI models, it&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">banking on Google&#39;s Gemini to power Siri&#39;s big AI upgrade</a>, as well as its future foundation models. When it comes to AI, Apple will do almost anything to avoid being seen as a straggler (and to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/10/ai-apple-stock-market" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">avoid even more stock declines</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s genuinely strange that Apple, the company that let Samsung and Google get a multi-year head start on foldable smartphones and hasn&#39;t yet jumped into the world of smart rings, could fast-track an AI pin for 2027. It’s yet another example of how the AI hype cycle has warped priorities throughout the tech industry. But at least Apple’s fortunes don’t depend on standalone AI hardware as much as OpenAI.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-ai-pin-is-beneath-apple-182744647.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Korg just officially unveiled the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/phase8/"><ins>Phase8 synthesizer</ins></a>, after years of tinkering by a team led by legendary engineer Tatsuya Takahashi. This is a highly experimental synthesizer, but it&#39;s not a concept unit. It&#39;ll be available for purchase in April.</p>
<p>The Phase8 uses a new form of &quot;acoustic synthesis&quot; that combines acoustic sound generation with electronic control. Takahashi <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.musicradar.com/music-tech/its-beyond-analogue-vs-digital-its-even-beyond-electronics-korg-releases-experimental-phase8-eight-voice-acoustic-synthesizer"><ins>says the synthesizer</ins></a> is &quot;beyond analog vs. digital&quot; and &quot;beyond electronics&quot; altogether. It features chromatically tuned steel resonators, which creates an acoustic sound similar to that of a kalimba. These signals can be manipulated via onboard effects and sequenced like a traditional synthesizer. Here&#39;s a video of the synth in action.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0bed0a4d53bc4780853b6ab8852c4d3e"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_w9PgAj4Llc?si=wwa9U6PMb4pV3Jxq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Players can mess with the resonators just like they would a guitar string or a piano key. Korg recommends that users physically touch, pluck, strum and tap the resonators to create new textures and tones. The company even suggests that people actually put objects on top of each resonator for additional experimentation. There&#39;s a slider that boots or dampens the acoustic response.</p>
<p>As for the electronics, the Phase8 boasts dedicated envelopes and velocity control for each resonator and there&#39;s a polymetric step sequencer. The sequences can be stored and recalled via eight memory slots. All controls can be automated across a sequence. There are a handful of modulation effects, including tremolo and pitch-shift.</p>

<p>It features modern connectivity options, including MIDI in/out via 3.5mm, USB MIDI, a standard ¼-inch audio out and a headphone jack, among other options. Preorders are open right now, but hold on to your jaw. This thing costs $1,150.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/korgs-new-experimental-synthesizer-combines-acoustic-sounds-with-electronic-control-180809332.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We already knew xAI&#39;s Grok was barraging X with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="slk:nonconsensual sexual images of real people;cpos:1;pos:1">nonconsensual sexual images of real people</a>. But now there are some numbers to put things in perspective. Over an 11-day period, Grok generated an estimated 3 million sexualized images — including an estimated 23,000 of children.</p><p>Put another way, Grok generated an estimated 190 sexualized images per minute during that 11-day period. Among those, it made a sexualized image of children once every 41 seconds.</p><p>On Thursday, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://counterhate.com/research/grok-floods-x-with-sexualized-images/" data-i13n="slk:published its findings;cpos:2;pos:1">published its findings</a>. The British nonprofit based its findings on a random sample of 20,000 Grok images from December 29 to January 9. The CCDH then extrapolated a broader estimate based on the 4.6 million images Grok generated during that period.</p><p>The research defined sexualized images as those with &quot;photorealistic depictions of a person in sexual positions, angles, or situations; a person in underwear, swimwear or similarly revealing clothing; or imagery depicting sexual fluids.&quot; The CCDH didn&#39;t take image prompts into account, so the estimate doesn&#39;t differentiate between nonconsensual sexualized versions of real photos and those generated exclusively from a text prompt.</p><p>The CCDH used an AI tool to identify the proportion of the sampled images that were sexualized. That may warrant some degree of caution in the findings. However, I&#39;m told that many third-party analytics services for X have reliable data because they use the platform&#39;s API.</p><p>On January 9, xAI restricted Grok&#39;s ability to edit existing images to paid users. (That didn&#39;t solve the problem; it merely turned it into a premium feature.) Five days later, X <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html" data-i13n="slk:restricted Grok&#39;s ability to digitally undress real people;cpos:3;pos:1">restricted Grok&#39;s ability to digitally undress real people</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/440c8f59-6000-4b81-a2d8-c404e6f5545f" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/440c8f59-6000-4b81-a2d8-c404e6f5545f" style="height:3852px;width:5778px;" alt="WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 23: Google CEO Sundar Pichai (L) and Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) listen as U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable with American and Indian business leaders in the East Room of the White House on June 23, 2023 in Washington, DC.

For those of you who just can&#39;t with Roman numerals, thats Super Bowl 60, and it&#39;s taking place this year at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA, on February 8, starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Like all other Sunday Night Football games this season, the championship game will be broadcast on Super Bowl Sunday on NBC, and will stream live on Peacock. And it&#39;s not just the game that we&#39;re excited for, either. This year&#39;s halftime performer is singer and rapper Bad Bunny, and there will be pre-game performances by Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile, and Coco Jones, it&#39;s truly an incredible lineup of talent. So while we wait to find out which teams will be competing in this year&#39;s game, the least we can do is let you know everything you need to know to tune in to Super Bowl LX when it airs on Feb. 8.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, but you might get stuck with a substandard app if you jump on the very first deal you see.

Many of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price.</p>

CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

The company promised the new chip would be out sometime in the first three months of the year, and it&#39;s going to arrive a bit sooner than you might have expected. It can be all yours on January 29 for $499.</p><p>AMD says the 9850X3D builds on the 9800X3D with an 400MHz upgrade to the boost clock. It can reach boost speeds of 5.6GHz. The Ryzen 7 9850X3D is an 8-core CPU with 16 threads and 104MB of combined L2 and L3 cache. AMD is employing its 3D V-cache tech so it can vertically stack more cache memory onto the chip.&nbsp;</p><p>The 9850X3D also has a 120W TDP. AMD claims the CPU is able to deliver an average 27 percent faster gaming performance than the Intel Core Ultra 9 285k. We&#39;ll be able to assess that for ourselves very soon given that the 9850X3D will hit shelves in just a few days.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-7-9850x3d-cpu-will-arrive-on-january-29-and-cost-499-165000446.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s the highest number of Oscar nominations for a single film in the history of the awards, followed by <em>Titanic</em>, <em>La La Land</em> and <em>All About Eve</em> with 14 noms each.</p>
<p><em>Sinners</em> grabbed a nomination in nearly every major category, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. The same goes for the performances, as Michael B. Jordan captured the nomination for Best Actor. Even Delroy Lindo got nominated for Best Supporting Actor, which is his <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/discussingfilm.net/post/3mczcs45quc2r">very first Oscar nomination</a> after 50 years in the business.</p>

<p>Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s One <em>Battle After Another</em> walked away with 13 nominations and Yorgos Lanthimos&#39; <em>Bugonia</em> scored four. Apple&#39;s <em>F1</em> actually got nominated for Best Picture, which is unusual for a popcorn-style blockbuster. Netflix scored Best Picture noms for both <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>Train Dreams</em>.</p>
<p>Netflix also got its flowers for the international animated sensation <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. It got nominated for Best Animated Feature and, of course, Best Original Song.</p>

The city was one of five <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-coming-to-five-more-cities-190000992.html"><ins>named</ins></a> in expansion plans last year, and joins the likes of Phoenix, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area on Waymo’s existing network.</p>
<p>Waymo <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/miami-your-waymo-ride-is-ready"><ins>says</ins></a> that nearly 10,000 Miami residents have signed up so far, and that it will send out invites to new riders on a rolling basis&quot; in the weeks and months to come. The autonomous ride-hailing service will initially cover a 60-square-mile area that includes neighborhoods like the Design District and Wynwood, with Waymo planning to expand to Miami International Airport soon.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Waymo started testing robotaxi rides in Miami in November, without passengers initially, which allows it to spot local potential issues and local quirks, and adjust the driving algorithm so things go smoothly once humans are involved. The company insists that autonomous vehicles are safe and reliable, claiming a &quot;ten-fold reduction&quot; in serious injuries caused by crashes compared to human drivers in its current areas of operation.</p>
<p>Waymo’s Florida expansion will move to Orlando next, with the Texas cities of San Antonio, Houston and Dallas also on the agenda for 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-is-now-available-in-miami-162515070.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-pull-context-the-rest-of-your-google-apps-if-you-let-it-160039468.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">adding Personal Intelligence</a> to Gemini as an opt-in experience, Google has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/personal-intelligence-ai-mode-search/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced</a> that it’s also integrating the feature into AI Mode in Search. What Personal Intelligence does is pull information from your Google apps to tailor its responses based on your history and interests. For Search, in particular, you can allow Personal Intelligence to look for information in your Gmail accounts and Google Photos libraries.</p><p>If you use AI Mode to shop for clothes with the new feature enabled, for instance, Google could recommend items or models from a brand you previously purchased from. If it sees plane tickets or other reservations in Gmail, Google could also recommend specific items based on your destination and the season if you’re clothes shopping for that trip.</p><p>Personal Intelligence is powered by Google’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Gemini 3</a> AI model. The company says it doesn’t train its models using information from your  Gmail inbox or Google Photos library, but it does use your prompts and AI Mode’s responses. Google also warned that sometimes, the feature’s recommendations could feel inaccurate because it could not fully comprehend the context or could make incorrect connections between separate topics. </p><p>At the moment, Personal Intelligence is an experimental feature that’s rolling out in Labs starting today. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US, who use the service in English, will automatically have access to it and be able to connect AI Mode to Gmail and Google Photos. It will only be available to personal Google accounts, however, and not for Workspace accounts just yet. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-in-google-search-can-now-pull-context-from-your-other-apps-160000103.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-right-now-180602025.html?src=rss]]></description>

The price could also be an issue for buyers, as the R6 III costs $300 more than its predecessor. Whether it’s worth that extra money depends on what you’re planning to do with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EOS R6 III is quintessentially Canon in terms of design. It strongly resembles the R6 II and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-eos-r5-ii-review-canons-most-powerful-camera-yet-puts-sony-on-notice-160013865.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">EOS R5 II</a>, with the same button and dial layout at the rear. In terms of functionality, this is a good thing as everything falls perfectly to hand, letting you control it by feel once you’re used to it. However, the R6 III’s design is a bit bland, so if you’re looking for a stylish camera <em>a la</em> Fujifilm, this is not the one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding the R6 III is also a pleasure thanks to the grippy, soft rubber exterior, though at 1.5 pounds it’s a bit heavier than the A7 V. It’s comfortable to hold and use all day, unlike Sony’s A7 V which felt uncomfortable after prolonged usage because of the harder material and sharp crease around the fingertip area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The R6 III’s 3.69-million dot, 120 fps electronic viewfinder (EVF) worked fine for me to check color and focus, but falls short of the one on the much cheaper Nikon Z6 III. The flip-out 3-inch 1.65-million-dot rear touch display is on par for this category and does the job well. For storage, the R6 III supports CFexpress Type B cards for capturing RAW video, along with SD UHS II for MP4 video and photos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other key features include headphone and microphone ports, a full-sized HDMI input (instead of microHDMI as before, thankfully) and a USB-C port for charging and transfers. Battery life is decent for this category with a maximum 510 shots per charge or 620 shots if you engage the power saving mode or about 90 minutes of continuous 4K capture. However, you can roughly double those figures with Canon&#39;s optional $150 BG-R20 battery grip.</p>

<p>The R6 III offers a boost in shooting speeds over its predecessor thanks to an all-new 33MP sensor. It has a faster readout speed than the R6 II as well, allowing for faster bursts and lower rolling shutter skew. In comparison, Sony’s A7 V also has a 33MP sensor but it’s partially stacked, so it delivers less distortion when shooting fast-moving subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that new sensor and a 34 percent faster Digic X processor, the R6 III can shoot bursts at up to 40 fps in electronic and 12 fps in mechanical shutter modes (with continuous AF and AE enabled). That’s second only to the Panasonic S1 II (70 fps) in this price range. You can fill the buffer in about 3.7 seconds at that speed (150 RAW frames), which is a decent amount for a midrange camera.</p>
<p>You usually want to avoid the electronic shutter with fast-moving action due to rolling shutter distortion, but the R6 III’s faster sensor can handle objects that are moving reasonably quickly. I also caught a few photos of babies, bikes and dogs I might have otherwise missed by using the new pre-capture mode that records up to 15 photos before fully declencing the shutter.</p>
<p>The new sensor and processor also make the R6 III’s autofocus system faster and more accurate than before. When shooting bursts for fast moving action like dogs running or biking, less than five percent of my shots were out of focus. And the EOS R6 III can now track animals, birds and vehicles, on top of the faces, eyes and bodies of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This camera also has a couple of new autofocus tricks, including one called Register People Priority. That lets you save up to 10 individuals on camera that it can identify and automatically switch to. I found it handy in a large gathering, helping me focus on my niece enjoying her second Christmas. However, the R6 III lacks a few autofocus features found on the R5 II like “action priority” for sports, eye control AF and AI upscaling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In-body stabilization is also excellent, keeping the sensor rock-steady for handheld shooting with 8.5 stops of shake reduction. With that enabled, I was able to nicely blur action on the streets while keeping the background sharply in focus at shutter speeds down to a full second.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-image-quality">Image quality</h2><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="bfdabb80-a86e-499b-8168-6e0fa364c25b"/>
<p>With a 33MP sensor instead of a 24MP sensor, the R6 III offers quite a bit more sharpness and a touch more dynamic range than its predecessor. When shooting RAW, I was able to coax a lot of detail out of high contrast shots on sunny days with dark shadows. However, Sony’s A7 V soundly beats the R6 III in terms of dynamic range, thanks to its innovative new sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The R6 III’s high ISO performance isn’t too bad for a higher-resolution camera either, with noise staying under control up to ISO 12,800. As is typical with Canon models, skin tones are warmer and more flattering than on Sony and Nikon cameras, due to the slightly more yellow-biased pink tones. Those pleasing colors were consistent, even at high ISOs, when I shot kids and adults at a couple of indoor gatherings. If you don’t want the hassle of RAW, JPEG rendering is excellent straight out of the camera, with well balanced sharpening and noise reduction.</p>
<p>Note that switching to electronic shutter mode drops the sensor to a 12-bit readout, which helps burst speeds but hurts image quality. This is a pretty big downside compared to the A7 V, which maintains 14-bit quality even when shooting at the camera’s maximum rate at 30 fps. So while on paper the R6 III wins the speed race, the 10 extra fps won’t be worth the drop in quality for many photographers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canon has improved video on the R6 III in every way, putting it nearly on par with the more expensive R5 II. Though it can’t shoot 8K, it can handle 7K RAW video at up to 60 fps (on CFexpress only) and 4K at 120p, with less rolling shutter than the R6 II. It also supports 3:2 “open gate” video that uses the full sensor area so you can output high-res vertical video and other formats.</p>
<p>The R6 III supports 4K 10-bit MP4 shooting at high data rates too if you’d rather save storage space or shoot on SD cards. You also get CLog 2 on top of CLog 3 capability for improved dynamic range. Oddly though, Canon made it a bit of a pain to switch to log modes compared to past models, forcing you to slog through a bunch of menus to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video autofocus is excellent across all resolutions, with rapid subject acquisition and reliable tracking. Face and eye detection work very well, and I only occasionally noticed slight autofocus lag with fast-moving subjects, particularly when they were moving toward the camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for stabilization, I could smoothly shoot handheld with no crop, provided I didn’t move the camera too aggressively. Digital stabilization allowed even more movement and the enhanced setting let me shoot smoothly while walking (7K doesn’t work in the digital stabilization modes, though). <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-ii-review-the-full-frame-vlogging-camera-youve-been-waiting-for-150028638.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Panasonic’s S5 II</a> is still the best in this regard with slightly smoother stabilization, but the R6 III isn’t far behind.</p>
<p>Video on the EOS R6 III is extremely sharp in RAW and the HQ modes, particularly with supersampled 4K HQ. Other 4K modes are subsampled, but nearly as sharp. Rolling shutter is better managed than before, but you’ll still want to avoid things like whip pans, sudden jolts or rapid subjects like propellers or golf swings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a variety of shooting scenarios in bright and dark conditions, Canon’s excellent color science delivered warm skin tones and accurate colors. Shooting RAW video allowed me to widely adjust shots in post, while the CLog 2 mode drastically improved dynamic range while I was shooting in contrasty conditions. For instance, I shot the famous Paris department store windows and was able to extract detail from the very bright and dark parts of the video.</p>
<p>Overheating has been an issue in the past on Canon’s R6 models, but the R6 III never shut down for me, even during a few tests of over 15 minutes. Overall, it reliably delivered outstanding video quality and I actually preferred it to the R5 II due to the smaller RAW file sizes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canon’s EOS R6 III is now the best midrange camera for creators thanks to the RAW video, rapid and accurate autofocus and excellent handling. At the same time, it’s a solid camera for photography with high burst speeds, extra resolution and, again, reliable AF. If it’s mainly photography you’re interested in, though, Sony’s $2,900 A7 V is a better choice. It matches the R6 III’s resolution, price and autofocus but offers superior dynamic range and lower rolling shutter distortion.</p>
<p>Other video-centric options may be more attractive for other reasons — including budget. <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D77SL8CY&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=75c5fc0f-94de-4c46-97a9-25282fe3fd47&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Nikon%E2%80%99s+24MP+Z6+III&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL05pa29uLUZ1bGwtRnJhbWUtbWlycm9ybGVzcy1JbnRlcm5hbC1SZWNvcmRpbmcvZHAvQjBENzdTTDhDWT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NWM1ZmMwZi05NGRlLTRjNDYtOTdhOS0yNTI4MmZlM2ZkNDciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vTmlrb24tRnVsbC1GcmFtZS1taXJyb3JsZXNzLUludGVybmFsLVJlY29yZGluZy9kcC9CMEQ3N1NMOENZIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUzwLpZK3e9R3WUtsVBlwt_QE_hnG-hOIlFfGJaGR9Go&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNikon-Full-Frame-mirrorless-Internal-Recording%2Fdp%2FB0D77SL8CY" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Full-Frame-mirrorless-Internal-Recording/dp/B0D77SL8CY">Nikon’s 24MP Z6 III</a> offers similar capabilities, has a partially stacked sensor and retails for $2,400, but can often be found on sale for less. <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0F8MHCD7V&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=75c5fc0f-94de-4c46-97a9-25282fe3fd47&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Panasonic%E2%80%99s+S1+II&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAaeELDB5rfrR_mUHCfEYD6cYpI20pXISSB_7HqF_s5Fj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPanasonic-Mirrorless-Shooting-Internal-Recording%2Fdp%2FB0F8MHCD7V%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Mirrorless-Shooting-Internal-Recording/dp/B0F8MHCD7V/">Panasonic’s S1 II</a> is also a good pick due to its RAW video and creator-centric features, though it costs more at $3,200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which one to buy, then, depends on your budget, usage (video or photography) and whether you already have lenses in one system or another. With that said, if it’s a Canon camera you’re after and you lean toward content creation, the EOS R6 III is your best choice.&nbsp;</p>

Those who own the original Switch version of the game will be able to buy an upgrade pack, which costs $20.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of new stuff in the Switch 2 version, including co-op and multiplayer features. Bellabel Park, a fresh area of the Flower Kingdom, will open up.

You can either play those on the same console or use GameShare so that up to three other people in the same physical place as you can join in on their own Switch or Switch 2. The Game Room Plaza, meanwhile, supports local and online play for six minigames — each player will need their own system for those. Up to eight people can play using the local wireless feature, and up to 12 via online multiplayer.</p><p>Along with those multiplayer minigame areas, Bellabel Park is home to Toad Brigade Training Camp. Here, you can take on challenges based on levels from the main game. You can tackle these on your own or recruit up to three friends to help (you&#39;ll only need one Switch 2 for this).&nbsp;</p><p>There are new things to check out in the main game as well. You can take on boss courses that feature all seven Koopalings and (finally!) play as Rosalina.</p><p>Nintendo is adding an option in which a second player can control a Luma. They can help out the main player by defeating enemies and collecting coins. You can play as the Luma by using the Switch 2 mouse control feature. That&#39;s a great idea, as it could allow, say, a parent or guardian who is not too familiar with a game controller to assist a kid who needs some extra help to get through <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, there&#39;s an assist mode. When this is enabled, you can quickly recover from falling into a pit (with a propeller flower bringing you back into the action) and avoid taking any damage.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s not all, folks. Also on March 26, you can snag three new amiibo from the game: Elephant Mario (which I&#39;m going to have to buy), Poplin &amp; Prince Florian and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of weeks earlier, on March 12, Nintendo will start selling a physical version of the Talking Flower from <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. The battery-powered device will talk to you a couple of times per hour, mentioning things like the room temperature and time. It can play music as well. There&#39;s a button you can press to hear it talk (or hold to make it shut up). There&#39;s support for 11 languages and it can chatter at set times, making it a bit similar to Nintendo&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-alarmo-review-charming-yet-frustrating-194432214.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Alarmo</a>. You&#39;ll be able to buy Talking Flower from Nintendo&#39;s New York and San Francisco stores, its online store and some other retailers, with pre-orders opening today.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uR4W3e-_3zs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2-version-of-super-mario-bros-wonder-arrives-on-march-26-150916983.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1Password has a new tool designed to counteract the advantages AI has given to phishing scammers. A new feature for the company&#39;s browser extension gives you a &quot;second pair of eyes&quot; to help you catch a bogus website before entering your login info.</p><p>Before AI, phishing attempts often included telltale signs like obvious typos or rudimentary graphic design. Now that AI makes it much easier to design and code convincingly, scams are on the rise. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://fortune.com/2026/01/13/ai-fraud-forecast-2026-experian-deepfakes-scams/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Fortune</em></a>, 60 percent of companies reported an increase in fraud-related losses from 2024 to 2025. And the advent of AI browsers could <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-browsers-may-be-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-scammers-220315936.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">make things even worse</a>.</p><p>“Our new phishing feature adds an extra layer of protection,” 1Password says. Once the feature is activated, the extension actively watches for suspicious sign-ins. To be clear, even before this feature&#39;s arrival, 1Password wouldn&#39;t autofill saved credentials for a bogus website impersonating it. But that still left room for people to manually paste their login info, handing it over to those with the worst intentions.</p><p>That moment when you try to paste your login manually is where the new feature comes in. &quot;The website you&#39;re on isn&#39;t linked to a login in 1Password,&quot; the feature&#39;s warning pop-up reads. &quot;Make sure you trust this site before continuing.&quot;</p><p>1Password says that&#39;s the &quot;breakthrough&quot; moment that can help you avoid a major hassle. &quot;That single moment of pause, that tiny bit of friction, is often all it takes to disrupt the attackers&#39; entire plan.&quot;</p><p>The new feature is available today. You can enable it in the 1Password browser extension&#39;s settings. Under the Notifications section, activate the setting for &quot;Warn about pasted logins on non-linked websites.&quot;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixQC3hIoGQ0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/1password-adds-an-extra-layer-of-phishing-protection-140000293.html?src=rss]]></description>

A new campaign called “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.stealingisntinnovation.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Stealing isn’t Innovation</a>” demands that AI companies take “the responsible, ethical route” through licensing and partnerships, according to the website. </p><p>“America’s creative community is the envy of the world and creates jobs, economic growth and exports,” a statement on the website reads. “But rather than respect and protect this valuable asset, some of the biggest tech companies, many backed by private equity and other funders, are using American creators’ work to build AI platforms without authorization for copyright law.” </p><p>The group adds that the “illegal intellectual property grab” has resulted in an information ecosystem dominated by “misinformation, deepfakes and a vapid artificial avalanche of low-quality materials [‘AI slop’]… threatening America’s AI superiority and international competitiveness.” </p><p>OpenAI once argued that it’s “impossible” to train AI without copyrighted materials, since “copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression.” However, actors, musicians and authors take issue with that idea, particularly when they see their likenesses or work repurposed as slop or worse by large language models (LLMs). </p><p>Johansson, for one, previously <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/scarlett-johansson-says-openai-used-her-likeness-without-permission-for-its-sky-voice-assistant-233451958.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">threatened</a> OpenAI with legal action in 2024 over a ChatGPT voice assistant that effectively cloned her voice.

Prompted Playlist, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-new-playlist-feature-gives-users-more-control-over-their-recommendation-algorithm-203237903.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the company trialed in New Zealand late last year</a>, lets subscribers &quot;control the Spotify algorithm,&quot; as the company describes it. &quot;You&#39;re not just asking for music, you&#39;re shaping how Spotify goes about discovering it for you.&quot;</p><p>For example, you can guide it to make a playlist of songs you&#39;ve saved to your Library but haven&#39;t listened to yet. (It can tap into your entire Spotify history.) Or, you can tell it to round up songs from a specific television show or movie. (It uses real-time information about pop culture, charts, and history.)</p><p>The feature includes options to refresh the playlist over time (daily or weekly). You can edit each playlist&#39;s prompt at any time. Each track will include a short note to explain why it was chosen.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Sampled_Favorites.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Sampled_Favorites.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Four screens showing the steps to produce a Spotify Prompted Playlist" data-uuid="741fb4f5-0eb5-48e1-9b5b-760e94542627"/><figcaption>The standard AI Playlist creator will remain alongside the new Prompted Playlist.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure><p>Spotify says beta testers have used Prompted Playlist to revisit songs tied to specific moments and filter out tracks they&#39;ve overplayed lately. &quot;Others are asking for long, lyric-free electronic playlists to power through a workday, or mixing in artists connected to current pop culture moments and viral trends,&quot; the company wrote.</p><p>There&#39;s room for some confusion here because Spotify already has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/spotifys-ai-playlists-are-now-available-for-premium-users-in-the-us-130008423.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">an &quot;AI Playlist&quot; feature</a>. That simpler type will stick around alongside the new &quot;Prompted&quot; variety, which allows for finer tuning and can sift through more data.</p><p>Prompted Playlist will be available to Spotify Premium subscribers in the US and Canada &quot;by the end of the month.&quot; Once you have access, you can try it by tapping Create, then selecting Prompted Playlist.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/spotifys-prompted-playlist-lets-you-describe-exactly-what-you-want-to-hear-140000153.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new year is the perfect time to get your spending in order, and if you&#39;re not trying to build your own spreadsheet, budgeting apps are one of the best ways to do it. To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a>, one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">Engadget&#39;s favorite budgeting apps</a>, for just $50 if you use code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout and you&#39;re a new subscriber. That&#39;s a 50 percent discount on the service&#39;s normal $100 price.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarch.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That&#39;s $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re thinking about upgrading to a new graphics card this year, your window for doing so at MSRP has closed. When I <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">first reported</a> on this at the start of December, things were looking bleak but you could still find GPUs from both AMD and NVIDIA at close to their recommended prices. That changed last week when YouTube channel <em>Hardware Unboxed</em> reported that ASUS had stopped <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-has-stopped-producing-the-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb-saying-theyve-reached-end-of-life-162012253.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">producing the RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB</a> due to ongoing memory shortages.&nbsp;</p><p>After Engadget published the news, NVIDIA disputed the report. “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a company spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, ASUS <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/asus-changes-mind-will-continue-selling-the-rtx-5070-ti-after-all-130934271.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">walked back its previous statements</a>. After “explicitly” telling <em>Hardware Unboxed</em> it had placed the 5060 Ti 16GB and 5070 Ti into &quot;end-of-life status,&quot; the company said &quot;certain media may have received incomplete information from an ASUS PR representative regarding these products,&quot; adding it had &quot;no plans to stop selling these models.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whether or not the 5060 Ti 16GB and 5070 Ti remain in production, one thing is certain: the AI boom has created a great deal of uncertainty in the GPU market. After the news, panic buying sent the price of the 5070 Ti through the roof. Right now, it&#39;s impossible to find that model priced at its MSRP of $749. As of the writing of this article, the most affordable version of the 5070 Ti I could find on Newegg was $1,199.&nbsp;</p><p>The bigger problem is that the 5070 Ti isn&#39;t the only GPU selling for far more than MSRP. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html#section-2-best-midrange-graphics-card-radeon-rx-9070-624-99" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Tom&#39;s Hardware</em></a><em> </em>has been tracking GPU prices for months, and there&#39;s not a single model you can buy at either AMD or NVIDIA&#39;s recommended price. That puts PC builders in a tough spot. What do you do if you want to upgrade to a new graphics card this year?&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re sitting on an older GPU, the best advice I can give is to stick with your current hardware. If you&#39;re fine with the performance of your video card right now, it&#39;s best to wait a year or two for the market to settle down. </p><p>On the other hand, if your current GPU is not up to the task of running the games you want to play, try to buy a card with at least 12GB of VRAM — preferably 16GB if your budget allows for it. Unless you plan to play mostly older games on a 1080p monitor, it&#39;s not worth considering a model with 8GB of VRAM — it won&#39;t last you long enough to warrant the purchase price.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, the recommendations in Engadget&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/how-to-buy-a-gpu-160100017.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">recent GPU guide</a> are still as relevant today as they were a few months ago. The recommendations I provide here are pulled from that guide and are grouped from most affordable to most expensive. Where possible, I&#39;ve tried to find options from both Newegg and Amazon. As you go about looking for a new GPU, your best friend is a website like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">PCPartPicker</a> where you can track pricing across multiple retailers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-recommendations">Recommendations</h2><h3 id="jump-link-amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb">AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB</h3><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/rx-9060.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/rx-9060.jpg" style="height:1229px;width:2400px;" alt="The Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB is the best mainstream option right now.

For that reason, I would steer you to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-review-finally-a-powerful-350-gpu-130037952.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Radeon RX 9060 XT</a> as the best &quot;entry-level&quot; option. AMD offers two different versions of this GPU: one with 8GB of VRAM and the other with 16GB. Of the two, the latter is the better purchase, but if it&#39;s outside your budget, the more affordable model is probably the best 8GB GPU on the market right now.</p><p>While I couldn&#39;t find the 16GB variant at its recommended price of $350, I did find a few models that weren&#39;t far off.

The app&#39;s Family Center already gives parents visibility into their child&#39;s friend list, but it will now surface contextual details when a new friend is added.</p><p>For example, the feature could highlight that the two share mutual friends or have each other&#39;s contact info saved in their phones. It could also indicate that they are classmates if both users have joined the same in-app “community.” If the two have no commonalities, then that could be a sign for a parent to &quot;start a productive conversation,&quot; Snap says.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has long been criticized for making it too easy for teenagers to talk <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-making-it-harder-for-strangers-to-contact-teens--again-163824048.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">to strangers</a>.

Snap says that adding additional &quot;trust signals&quot; to its parental control features &quot;make it easier for parents to understand new connections and have greater confidence that their teen is chatting with someone they know in real life.&quot;</p><p>The update is also adding more granular stats about how exactly teens are spending their time in the app. Family Center&#39;s screen time dashboard now includes a breakdown of how much of their time spent in the app is in its messaging, camera, map or shortform video features.

Whether you&#39;re into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. Some are even subtle enough to wear 24/7, like smart rings, while others double as stylish smartwatches.<br><br>There are great options out there for beginners as well as more advanced users, and the variety of features means there’s something for every lifestyle and budget. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the best fitness trackers you can buy right now, and explain who each one is best suited for.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-do-fitness-trackers-do-best">What do fitness trackers do best?</h2> 
<p>The answer seems simple: Fitness wearables are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands and smart rings have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, better battery life, durability and price.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their advanced health tracking abilities — things like all-day resting heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, and even detailed sleep tracker insights. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous gadget on their wrists all day.</p> 
<p>Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled. Many fitness trackers also slot nicely into your existing ecosystem, syncing seamlessly with your smartphone, other fitness apps and cloud storage to keep all your data in one place.</p> 
<p>When it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid smart band starting at $70. That makes them a great entry point for beginners who want to track their progress without committing to a full smartwatch. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-when-to-get-a-smartwatch-instead">When to get a smartwatch instead</h2> 
<p>If you need a bit more from your wearable and don’t want to be limited to a fitness or activity tracker, a smartwatch may be the best buy for you. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications. Just make sure your smartwatch is compatible with your Android or iPhone, however, before purchasing, as not all of them work with both operating systems.</p> 
<p>But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.</p> 
<p>If you’re someone who’s seriously training — say for a race or an endurance challenge — a dedicated <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html">running watch</a> may be worth considering. These often provide more in-depth cardio analytics, recovery insights, and real-time pace data that go beyond what standard trackers can deliver.</p>

You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you. When compared to the Charge 6, the Inspire 3 is more fashionable, too. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-fitness-tracker-batteries-last">How long do fitness tracker batteries last?</h3> 
<p>The battery life of fitness trackers can vary depending on the model and its features. On average, most fitness trackers last between five to seven days on a single charge. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more. However, more advanced trackers with features like continuous heart rate monitoring, GPS, or always-on displays may need recharging after one to three days. If you&#39;re using GPS or streaming music through your fitness tracker, you&#39;ll find that this drains the battery faster. By using these features less, or turning them off, you&#39;ll extend battery life.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This year, the Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, February 8, 2026 at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. NBC has the rights to air the broadcast, which means you can watch it with a live TV streaming subscription to YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV or DirecTV.

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-live-tv-streaming-service">What to look for in a live TV streaming service</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-stream-live-tv"><strong>How to stream live TV</strong></h3> 
<p>Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">streaming device</a> and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-monthly-price"><strong>Monthly Price</strong></h3> 
<p>When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html">price difference</a> between live TV and a <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html">standard video streaming app</a>. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-local-channels"><strong>Local channels</strong></h3> 
<p>Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p> 
<p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D9NZTGLF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=HD+antenna&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYFrBzybV7JrmQ6EI0-2SiNJpVRVKi5fSnmf_a2Xkzyj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAntenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels%2Fdp%2FB0D9NZTGLF" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels/dp/B0D9NZTGLF">HD antenna</a>, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p> 
<p>But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-signs-deal-to-host-live-tv-channels-in-france-153852590.html">recently announced deal</a> with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1&#39;s live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-live-sports-coverage"><strong>Live sports coverage</strong></h3> 
<p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=upcoming+nfl+games">upcoming games</a> (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.</p> 
<p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p> 
<p>I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Peacock TV;elmt:;cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peacock+TV&amp;linkText=Peacock&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnRVh_g_jgVhSp7LBrtJVkcMpZ3bn_n25jQbBiVS3P6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.peacocktv.com/">Peacock</a> carries <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-ui-update-183247828.html">live</a> Premier League matches, <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-nfl-wild-card-game-broke-streaming-records-103503762.html">Sunday Night Football</a> games and aired the 2024 <a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-2024-paris-olympics-coverage-includes-enhanced-multiview-options-190047120.html">Olympic Games</a> from Paris. <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-x-ray-replays-thursday-night-football-173723667.html">Thursday Night Football</a> as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-tv-rights-go-to-espn-nbc-and-amazon-as-tnt-is-rejected-230811550.html">NBA and WNBA games</a> are on Amazon Prime and <a data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html">Christmas Day Football</a> airs on Netflix.

<p><strong>Traditional cable networks</strong></p> 
<p>Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.</p> 
<p>Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps.

Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-on-demand-streaming"><strong>On-demand streaming</strong></h3> 
<p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p> 
<p>Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-digital-video-recordings-dvr-limits"><strong>Digital video recordings (DVR) limits</strong></h3> 
<p>Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.</p> 
<p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-simultaneous-streams-and-profiles-per-account"><strong>Simultaneous streams and profiles per account</strong></h3> 
<p>Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.</p> 
<p>Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-picture-in-picture-mode-and-multiview"><strong>Picture-in-picture mode and multiview</strong></h3> 
<p>Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this.

<p>Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tiers-packages-and-add-ons"><strong>Tiers, packages and add-ons</strong></h3> 
<p>Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-live-tv-streaming-services">How we tested live TV streaming services</h2> 
<p>When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the <a data-i13n="cpos:68;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p> 
<p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p> 
<p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-live-tv-streaming-faqs">Live TV Streaming FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-live-streaming"><strong>What is live streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. <em>Live</em> streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-streaming-and-live-streaming"><strong>What is the difference between streaming and live streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-streaming-service-is-best-for-live-tv"><strong>What streaming service is best for live TV?</strong></h3> 
<p>FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-cost-effective-tv-streaming-service"><strong>What is the most cost effective TV streaming service?</strong></h3> 
<p>Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-it-cheaper-to-have-cable-or-streaming"><strong>Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don&#39;t have contracts.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-streaming-service-has-all-the-tv-channels"><strong>What streaming service has all the TV channels?</strong></h3> 
<p>No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, <a data-i13n="cpos:80;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/">according to Neilsen</a>. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-popular-live-tv-streaming-platform"><strong>What is the most popular live TV streaming platform?</strong></h3> 
<p>YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:81;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/">letter</a> from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter <a data-i13n="cpos:82;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/disney-earnings-inside-out-2-deadpool-wolverine-disney-hulu-streaming-theme-parks-1236176347/">earnings</a> put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s <a data-i13n="cpos:83;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sling-tv-slips-below-2-135658433.html">customer count dipped</a> from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to <a data-i13n="cpos:84;pos:1" href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2024/Fubo-Closed-Q3-2024-With-21-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Growth-and-1.613M-Subscribers-in-North-America/default.aspx">1.6 million</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-safe-are-free-streaming-services-and-websites"><strong>How safe are free streaming services and websites?</strong></h3> 
<p>You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.</p> 
<p>But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.</p>

It’s made up of compilations of accounts new users can follow based on their interests. If that sounds familiar, it’s because Bluesky <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-starter-packs-help-new-users-find-their-way-234322177.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">launched a very similar feature</a> that’s also called “starter packs” back in 2024. Bluesky allows ordinary users to curate their own packs as long as each one doesn’t exceed 50 accounts. They can then share those lists broadly on the platform or directly with new users via QR code. X, on the other hand, compiled and curated its own lists. </p><p>In his announcement, X head of product Nikita Bier said the company “scoured the world for the top posters in every niche and country.” X then compiled them into Starterpacks “to help new users find the best accounts — big or small — for their interests.” Before X announced its own take on the feature, other social media services had already launched their clones of Bluesky’s tool. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-take-on-bluesky-starter-packs-is-live-193106158.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Threads’ version</a>, which rolled out in late 2024, puts collections of recommended profiles as suggestions in the feeds of new users.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Marshall plans to add seamless multi-room audio to its Bluetooth speakers via a newly announced music streaming hub called <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.marshall.com/us/en/product/heddon?pid=1009160" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">Heddon</a>. The $300 hub makes it possible to connect and synchronize multiple older Marshall speakers together, not unlike Sonos&#39; audio devices.</p><p>Rather than use Wi-Fi to get multiple speakers playing the same audio, though, the Marshall Heddon uses <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluetooth-auracast-is-everywhere-at-ces-2024-so-what-is-it-224509414.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Auracast</a>. The hub connects to services like Spotify Connect or Tidal over Wi-Fi, or other devices through Google Cast and AirPlay, and then shares that audio over Auracast to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/marshall-home-speakers-acton-stockton-woburn-iii-lineup-wide-soundstage-hdmi-140038655.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Marshall Acton III, Stanmore III and Wobrun III speakers</a>. You can control playback over a connected Marshall app and the Heddon also has RCA ports to connect other speakers or a record player to the system.</p><p>Because the Heddon requires a Wi-Fi connection, Marshall says it could add features to the system over-time, but even in the short term, the hub should meaningfully extend the life of the company&#39;s speakers. Rather than switch to newer models with built-in Wi-Fi, you can just grab a Heddon. Sonos offers similar functionality through its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-sonos-one-sl-port.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Sonos Port</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-29-sonos-amp-streaming-av-hub.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Sonos Amp</a> accessories, and third-party hubs from companies like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.wiimhome.com/index" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">WiiM</a> can add even more options. The Marshall Heddon is more streamlined in comparison, but if you&#39;re already invested in the company&#39;s speakers, or planning to build out your audio system with them, the hub could be a helpful tool to have.</p><p>The Marshall Heddon is available to purchase now for $300. Marshall says that customers purchasing an Acton III, Stanmore III or Woburn III can get a Heddon at half price, and the hub is included for free when you buy two or more eligible Marshall home speakers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/marshalls-new-heddon-hub-adds-multi-room-audio-to-speakers-with-auracast-210500811.html?src=rss]]></description>

The wearable is said to resemble a slightly thicker AirTag and include multiple cameras, a speaker, microphones, and wireless charging.</p><p>The report coincides with another <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that claims that Apple will revamp Siri as a ChatGPT-style chatbot. When combined with the recent announcement that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Google&#39;s Gemini will power Siri AI</a>, it looks like the company is finally making a more defined play for a piece of the generative AI pie. On the other hand, the wearable pin is reportedly only in the very early stages and could still be canceled.</p><p>The pin is described as a thin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum and glass exterior. It includes two cameras (standard and wide-angle) for taking photos and videos of the user&#39;s surroundings. It also has three microphones. It includes a speaker and a physical button along one edge. It has a magnetic inductive charging interface, similar to the Apple Watch&#39;s charging mechanism.</p><p>Given the way Apple markets itself as a privacy-focused company, it will be interesting to see how the company pitches the public on what sounds like an incognito recording device. Although on that note, the App Store still hosts the Grok app, which egregiously violates privacy by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/28-advocacy-groups-call-on-apple-and-google-to-ban-grok-x-over-nonconsensual-deepfakes-215048460.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">generating nearly-nude deepfakes of real people</a> — despite Apple&#39;s rules explicitly prohibiting such apps.</p><p><em>The Information</em> says Apple could release its AI pin as early as 2027. The company sounds confident in the device&#39;s appeal, as it reportedly plans to produce around 20 million units at launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-is-reportedly-developing-a-wearable-ai-pin-204705065.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2026/01/21/play-more-xbox-app-is-now-available-on-arm-based-windows-11-pcs/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that the Xbox app is now available on all Arm-based Windows 11 PCs. The app&#39;s release follows <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windowsosplatform/windows-on-arm-runs-more-apps-and-games-with-new-prism-update/4475631" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">an update</a> Microsoft made to its Prism emulator in December 2025, which translates x86 and x64 apps to Arm, and now includes support for AVX and AVX2. Both extensions play a role in making games run efficiently on Windows.</p><p>Windows on Arm users will be able to use the Xbox app to purchase, download and stream PC games, and Microsoft says that &quot;more than 85 percent of the Game Pass catalog&quot; now runs on Arm PCs. Unlike Valve&#39;s SteamOS, Windows on Arm also supports anti-cheat software like Epic&#39;s Easy Anti Cheat, which means you can access a wider library of online multiplayer games in comparison to what you can get on the Steam Deck.</p><p>Microsoft has been working on getting Windows running on Arm for years at this point, and the company made a major push with its own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-copilot-review-the-best-surface-tablet-ever-made-no-thanks-to-ai-160039966.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Arm-based hardware</a> and the launch of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Copilot+ PC program</a> in 2024.

Up until this point Microsoft&#39;s handheld efforts have been focused on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">PCs running AMD chips</a>, but expanded support for Arm and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853851/qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-plus-elite-laptops-price-ces-2026#:~:text=Qualcomm%20won%E2%80%99t%20talk,9th%20to%2013th." data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Qualcomm&#39;s own teases</a> certainly makes it seem like an Arm-based Windows 11 handheld could be announced sooner rather than later.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/microsoft-ports-the-xbox-app-to-arm-based-windows-pcs-191049475.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple TV+ has become one of the best streaming services for sci-fi, with hits like <em>Pluribus</em>, <em>Severance</em>, <em>Foundation</em> and many more. There are so many shows that it&#39;s easy to forget the one that started it all. <em>For All Mankind</em> was the platform&#39;s very first attempt at sci-fi and it&#39;s finally coming back after two years for season five on March 27.</p>
<p>The next season will run for ten episodes on a weekly basis. It concludes on May 29, with new installments dropping each Friday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b72d2ca11c52427f8af4e41c9dbf6b6f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nF6tso9D9jc?si=kOeM8m3-uDRXvngh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>What follows are some slight spoilers for the show, so read with caution. The streamer <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tso9D9jc"><ins>dropped a short teaser</ins></a> to announce the release date and it shows Alex Baldwin, grandson of the show&#39;s original star, careening around Mars on some sort of motorcycle.</p>
<p><em>For All Mankind</em> started as an alt-history show that explored what would happen if Russia beat the USA to the moon in the 1960s. However, it has since become famous for time jumps. The next installment takes place in an alternate version of the 2010s and continues the story of competing space agencies after turning Mars into a viable colony.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/one-medical-ai-health-assistant"><ins>is introducing</ins></a> an AI-powered assistant to One Medical, the tech-forward primary care provider it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-completes-one-medical-acquisition-163431975.html"><ins>acquired in 2023</ins></a>. Dubbed &#39;Health AI,&#39; Amazon says the tool &quot;provides 24/7 personalized health guidance based on your medical records.&quot;</p>
<p>The company says Health AI can explain lab results, help manage medications, and book appointments for patients. Amazon also says it can &quot;analyze images&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify whether this means medical imaging or user uploaded photos. While the company specifically says the tool &quot;complements, but does not replace,&quot; a patient&#39;s healthcare provider, it also vaguely says the AI can &quot;answer general and complex health questions&quot; while &quot;considering your unique health history.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Health AI recognizes when symptoms, situations, or specific queries require or benefit from human clinical judgment,&quot; reads the company&#39;s announcement, while giving few details on just how much medical advice the AI tool is empowered to give.</p>
<p>Use of AI tools brings up data privacy concerns, and Amazon says it follows HIPAA-compliant privacy and security practices. The company says that a user&#39;s conversations with Health AI are &quot;not automatically added to your medical record.&quot; This of course implies the option to do just that. It also says the company doesn&#39;t sell members&#39; protected health information.</p>
<p>One Medical has a limited number of brick-and-mortar offices in major metros throughout the US, but the focus of the company seems to be telehealth services. These services are offered as part of an annual subscription, which is discounted for Amazon Prime members. This is only the latest investment Amazon has made in the healthcare space. In recent years the tech giant has begun <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-to-bring-same-day-prescription-deliveries-to-nearly-half-of-the-us-next-year-185708164.html"><ins>same-day prescription deliveries</ins></a> in certain markets, and built <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-will-start-dispensing-prescription-drugs-through-vending-machines-144555105.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawPd8mlleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFGT3lLbzZrZ3hId0pZNjZ1c3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHpe-fTo1JrZmaAazc6tqECMSX6AJDGbRmJXL0JBoRoTrXQplBl6ivlbWzFzB_aem_BvXaJ7UFhzyxfe13R-FJ7g"><ins>vending machines</ins></a> for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Health AI follows the trend of AI companies competing to enter healthcare with their AI-powered chatbots. Google added an AI health coach to the Fitbit app <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-health-coach-will-soon-be-available-to-some-fitbit-premium-users-170022769.html"><ins>last year</ins></a>, and OpenAI announced a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-is-launching-a-new-dedicated-health-portal-210150083.html"><ins>dedicated health portal</ins></a> within ChatGPT in January.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-adding-ai-powered-assistant-to-one-medical-180803368.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two high-profile upcoming Ubisoft games have been starting to look more and more like vaporware with each passing year. One of them is <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, which we were <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/beyond-good--evil-2-is-somehow-still-under-development-185230052.html">assured</a> is still in development last year. The other is the <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>remake, which is now officially canceled, along with five other games on Ubisoft’s release slate.</p>
<p>The news came in a media briefing attended virtually by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-details-major-company-reset-6-games-canned-7-delayed-and-2-studios-closed/"><em>VGC</em></a>, in which the French company also announced delays to seven other games as part of a major restructuring. As reported by <em>VGC</em>, the only canceled game currently named by Ubisoft is the remake of its 2003 classic, which was first <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-january-21-194054196.html">announced</a> in 2020 and has by all accounts been in various <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-191158018.html">stages</a> of development <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-toronto-is-helping-out-with-the-troubled-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-050059045.html">hell</a> ever since. Three of the others were original new IPs and one was a mobile game.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft isn’t putting names to the more than half dozen delayed games either, but <em>VGC</em>’s report says one was supposed to come out in the first quarter of this year, and will now release before April 2027. While it’s yet to be officially announced, a remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag </em>has been heavily <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">rumored</a> for several months and is likely one of the games that has slipped.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also outlined its new organizational model, which will see the company split into five &quot;creative houses&quot; that function as independent business units. One of these is the previously <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-launches-its-new-tencent-backed-subsidiary-194750403.html">announced</a>, Tencent-backed Vantage Studios, which will oversee a number of the company’s flagship franchises, including Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>
<p>In its Wednesday briefing, Ubisoft also confirmed recent reports that it’s closing its <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-outlaws-developer-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm-face-layoffs-134234968.html">Stockholm</a> and (recently unionized) <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html">Halifax</a> studios, with others, including <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/i-really-want-to-like-star-wars-outlaws-160032476.html"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>developer Massive Entertainment due to be restructured as a result of the new model. Ubisoft declined to tell <em>VGC </em>exactly how many layoffs could occur in the wake of the large-scale reorganization of the company.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-among-six-games-canceled-by-ubisoft-175801132.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volvo hasn&#39;t exactly had a great run of EVs lately. The rollout of its flagship EX90 was stymied out of the gate by a bevy of software glitches. The EX30, meanwhile, was too expensive when it launched — the promised $35,000 model was incompatible with the currently chaotic global tariff situation.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s time for a new generation of EV from Volvo, one that&#39;s radically different at its core with a gigacast frame, a much higher-density battery and enough digital and literal horsepower to impress the most jaded of automotive enthusiasts. Mix in high-performance chipsets from both NVIDIA and Qualcomm, plus Google&#39;s Gemini AI onboard, and on paper, it has a lot to offer. After getting an early look at the thing at its unveiling in Sweden, I feel like this EV is ready and able to face off against BMW&#39;s new iX3 and Mercedes-Benz&#39;s upcoming <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/mercedes-benz-glc-with-eq-technology-prototype-drive-better-when-chilled-230157718.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">GLC</a>.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the basics: The EX60 slots in the Volvo product lineup right alongside the existing XC60, Volvo&#39;s most popular model in the U.S. It&#39;s a two-row, mid-size SUV that seats five, the sort of thing perfect for those with small families or big dogs. It&#39;ll be available in three different basic configurations, starting with the single-motor, rear-drive, 369-horsepower, 310-mile EX60 P6. Next up is the AWD dual-motor, 503-hp, 320-mile P10, and finally the top-shelf, 670-hp, 400-mile P12.</p><p>670 horsepower in an SUV of this size seems frankly excessive to me, but then it does have a lot of weight to move around — 5,137 pounds to be exact. That’s thanks in large part to the P12&#39;s 112-kilowatt-hour net battery pack which is about 50 percent bigger than the one inside a Tesla Model Y. The P6 is a relatively svelte 4,663 pounds thanks to its smaller 80-kWh net battery pack, while the P10 has 91 kWh.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/JPG_Full-vin0490_34FrontAlt_746_EX60_ROW.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/JPG_Full-vin0490_34FrontAlt_746_EX60_ROW.jpg" style="height:1920px;width:2560px;" alt="Volvo EX60" data-uuid="ca4e21b7-6fed-4e16-b020-a599390a98f4"/><figcaption>Volvo EX60</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure><p>Beyond the powertrain divisions, the Volvo EX60 will also be available in a variety of different trims with varying amounts of equipment, including the Volvo Cross Country edition with air suspension and a 20mm boost of ride height. Prices are said to start &quot;around $60k&quot; for an EX60 P10 Plus with a 21-speaker Bose system, but a 28-speaker Bowers &amp; Wilkins system with Dolby Atmos will be available for those who really need <em>all</em> the channels.</p><p>Of course, Atmos support is no good without a good source, and to that end, the EX60 will be the first Volvo with Apple Music built in. That&#39;ll be part of the company&#39;s Android Automotive-based infotainment system, running on a curved 15-inch OLED screen and powered by a Qualcomm 8255 chipset. It’s paired with a low, wide gauge cluster set far back on the dashboard behind the steering wheel.</p><p>This will also be Volvo&#39;s first car with integrated Gemini, and indeed one of the first cars on the road with Google&#39;s smart agent. You can, of course, do typical Gemini things like ask about the weather or the nuances of René Descartes&#39;s concepts on dualism. Beyond that, Volvo CTO Anders Bell said that it will eventually gain access to the car&#39;s outward-looking cameras, meaning you&#39;ll be able to ask for more details on whatever it is you can see looming on the horizon.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/JPG_Full-vin0370_CSD_WG20_EX60_ROW.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/JPG_Full-vin0370_CSD_WG20_EX60_ROW.jpg" style="height:1920px;width:2560px;" alt="Volvo EX60" data-uuid="b86d7c3c-f7b3-42d6-8278-bd6c241a353b"/><figcaption>Volvo EX60</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure><p>Volvo calls the car&#39;s software-defined architecture and the hardware that powers it HuginCore, named for Huginn, the raven of Norse mythology and represents Odin&#39;s mind and senses. Qualcomm powers the infotainment side of the avian experience, but when it comes to active safety, the EX60 relies on an NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin chipset. Unlike the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvos-ex90-suv-was-mostly-worth-the-wait-153035616.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">EX90</a>, the EX60 will not use a LiDAR sensor.</p><p>Volvo CTO Bell downplayed the absence of the sensor. &quot;We realized we can now achieve many more meaningful and safe automated functions without LiDAR than we could have years ago,&quot; he said. Per Bell, LiDAR was never really in the plan for the EX60 anyway, a decision looking all the brighter given the recent bankruptcy of Volvo&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-luminar-LiDAR-built-in-self-driving-cars-161838644.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">former LiDAR partner Luminar</a>.</p><p>The car&#39;s cameras and radar sensors all tuck nicely into the new exterior of the EX60, which certainly doesn&#39;t look miles off from the EX90 or indeed the current, gas-powered XC60. But the pronounced flares on the front fenders are a nice touch of personality on an otherwise understated SUV.</p><p>At the core of the EX60 is a new platform Volvo calls SPA3, with a chassis made using gigacasting. This refers to the force required to inject molten aluminum into massive castings, allowing more of the car to be made from fewer components. Volvo says the carbon footprint of the EX60 is lower even than that of the much smaller EX30.</p><p>The battery packs use the on-trend cell-to-pack construction method, which means all the cells are lumped together into a single unit. Typically, this boosts density at the cost of repairability, a tradeoff most manufacturers seem willing to make in pursuit of higher range and lower costs. However, Bell said that the company has actually made pack maintenance easier by optimizing the layout of the ancillary equipment.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/JPG_Full-vin0120_DetailTailgate_746_EX60_ROW.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/JPG_Full-vin0120_DetailTailgate_746_EX60_ROW.jpg" style="height:1920px;width:2560px;" alt="Volvo EX60" data-uuid="0b4aad7a-077e-42d8-966c-01679c342397"/><figcaption>Volvo EX60</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure><p>&quot;The absolute vast majority, 90 percent of anything that ever needs to be repaired on a battery pack is electronics,&quot; he said. In the EX60, Volvo positioned the battery electronics beneath the rear seat to make them even easier to access. &quot;We save a lot of weight, save a lot of cost.&quot;</p><p>The EX60 will be Volvo&#39;s first car to use the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-has-won-the-ev-charging-wars-155726724.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Tesla-style NACS charging standard</a>, and the largest two packs will support charging speeds up to 370 kW. That drops to 320 kW on the 80-kWh net P6.</p><p>In practical terms, though, they&#39;re all roughly the same. Each model charges from 10 to 80 percent in less than 20 minutes, adding between 160 and 173 miles of range in 10 minutes. That&#39;s not quite the 200 miles BMW&#39;s iX3 can manage in the same time, but it is close.</p><p>The iX3 will probably be the EX60&#39;s fiercest competition when Volvo opens up orders later this spring. The EX60&#39;s $60,000 price for a midrange P10 Plus puts it right in line with the $60,000 that BMW says to expect for its iX3. Mercedes hasn&#39;t set American pricing for its GLC yet, but that, too, will be on a lot of shoppers&#39; lists to compare.</p><p>I&#39;ve already been impressed by how both the iX3 and the GLC drive. Sadly, Volvo wouldn&#39;t let me behind the wheel of its EX60 just yet, but hopefully I can report back with impressions soon to start to see how all these stack up on the road.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvo-ex60-suv-preview-400-mile-range-670-hp-and-google-gemini-onboard-173000033.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>So why now? Company insiders have suggested it&#39;s because Musk wants to build AI data centers in space. Google recently announced it was looking into <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/"><ins>putting a data center in space</ins></a>, with test launches scheduled for 2027. Musk reportedly wants to beat his rival to the punch, but SpaceX would need the billions of dollars in capital that an IPO would deliver. Putting a giant center in space isn&#39;t cheap.</p>

<p>Sources say that Musk wants to complete the IPO by July. SpaceX is reportedly expected to select banks to lead the stock offering in the near future.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is just as wary of the rise of AI slop as you, and that’s why more AI-generated content is coming to the platform in the near future. In a lengthy <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> outlining YouTube’s 2026 plans, CEO Neal Mohan said the company will continue to embrace this new &quot;creative frontier&quot; by soon allowing its creators to throw together Shorts using their AI-generated likeness.</p>
<p>Mohan didn’t elaborate further about how this feature will work when it launches, but acknowledged the &quot;critical&quot; issue of deepfakes currently polluting the web, and reaffirmed his company’s support for new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-supports-the-no-fakes-act/"><ins>legislation</ins></a> such as the NO FAKES Act. YouTube also allows its own creators to protect themselves against unauthorized use of their likeness using a detection feature that scans newly uploaded videos for matches.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other fresh AI (note: in no way slop) features referenced in the post include the currently-in-beta no-code <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-is-letting-creators-make-playable-games-with-a-gemini-3-tool-195500318.html"><ins>Playables</ins></a> platform, which lets you make games using Gemini 3 with a single text prompt, as well as new music creation tools. At the same time, Mohan said YouTube is building on its existing systems designed to combat spam, clickbait and &quot;low quality AI content.&quot; He added that an average of six million daily viewers watched more than 10 minutes of AI autodubbed content in December, despite the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/amazon-halts-ai-anime-dub-beta-after-widespread-ridicule-141501051.html"><ins>issues</ins></a> that rival platforms have had with similar features.</p>
<p>Mohan didn’t say when we can expect the new AI likeness generation feature for Shorts, but if that sounds like the sort of content you’d rather not encounter on your lunch break, here’s a little PSA: the company now allows you to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-will-let-you-exclude-shorts-from-search-results-204500097.html"><ins>omit</ins></a> its short-form videos from your YouTube search results altogether.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-ceo-promises-more-ai-features-in-2026-162409452.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I vividly remember when Bose announced the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Ultra Open Earbuds</a>. While I applauded the company for trying something different, I wasn’t sure if the clip-on design would take hold. Well, here we are almost two years later and most earbud makers now have something akin to Bose’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-clip-onto-your-ears-and-cost-300-172544076.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">fashion experiment</a>. You can now count Sony among those as the company revealed its <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0G4SKRJG7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c5596ec4-aa53-4520-b30f-570b742072f6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=LinkBuds+Clip+%28%24230%29&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAas7yiyuWltEZ5cRjx-kxFxblMG0mYljYOmek_FH3pep&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Comfortable-Lightweight-Awareness-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0G4SKRJG7" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Comfortable-Lightweight-Awareness-Resistant/dp/B0G4SKRJG7?th=1">LinkBuds Clip ($230)</a> open-fit earbuds today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These aren’t the first open-wear earbuds in Sony’s LinkBuds lineup. The company has two generations of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-linkbuds-fit-and-linkbuds-open-review-two-designs-one-clear-champ-134529932.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">LinkBuds Open</a> (originally called just <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-linkbuds-review-170020552-170020705.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">LinkBuds</a>) under its belt, giving users a more traditional earbud fit with donut-shaped drivers that let ambient sounds in. Now Sony is taking a cue from Bose and others with a clip-on design that attaches securely and comfortably to the ear while leaving the ear canal unobstructed. It’s clear companies believe customers like this type of earbuds, but Sony’s challenge is to make the LinkBuds Clip unique among the growing list of alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-and-fit">Design and fit</h2>
<p>Sony isn’t offering anything distinctive in terms of design here, but that’s okay. To be fair, I haven’t seen too much innovation in terms of aesthetics in these clip-on-style earbuds. For the most part, they all have similar shapes: two cylindrical cases connected by short, flexible cable. True to its predecessors, Sony put the drivers in a squatty housing while the bulk of the components are in a larger one that sits behind your ear lobe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony kept the weight of the LinkBuds Clip low, and it avoided the bulk of the Ultra Open Earbuds. Both of these factors contribute to a very comfortable fit, so the IPX4-rated earbuds can be easily worn all day without becoming a burden. And while I didn’t need them, Sony includes a pair of flexible silicone “fitting cushions” in the box. These clip on to the short, flat cable of the newest LinkBuds for a more secure fit. During my tests, the LinkBuds Clip stayed in place just fine without them, but there also wasn’t any decreased comfort when I did install them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last design-related item I’ll mention is the touch controls. On the LinkBuds Clip, the flat connector between the two housings accepts taps for playback controls, volume changes, cycling through sound modes and more. You can tap along this area to make an adjustment, and you don’t have to do so right in the center. The LinkBuds Clip were pleasantly responsive during this review, quickly completing the task without delay or repeated taps. That is, except for volume, because you have to keep tapping for that change to happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sony typically throws <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a whole host of features</a> at its earbuds. Even though they’re technically the company’s midrange line, the LinkBuds family has a robust set of conveniences that make them well suited for both productivity and leisure. Unfortunately, the LinkBuds Clip doesn’t have as much to offer here. The company gives you the basics, like the ability to fine-tune the tap controls or customize the EQ, and there’s even the Adaptive Audio tool that lets you customize settings based on activity or location (Sony calls them “scenes”). But there are some handy features I’ve come to expect from Sony that are notably absent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LinkBuds Clip doesn’t support speak-to-chat, Sony’s voice recognition feature that pauses audio and activates ambient sound when you start talking. Quick attention mode, the tool that lowers the volume and lets in ambient sound for brief chats, isn’t here either. These earbuds don’t even have wear detection, and you have to settle for regular ol’ DSEE audio upscaling instead of an enhanced version of that tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony did equip the LinkBuds Clip with unique listening modes meant to enhance the audio performance in two scenarios. First, Voice Boost increases the volume of voices when you’re on a call or listening to podcasts or audiobooks. The company says this is designed for noisy environments where the ambient sound is overly raucous. During my testing, I found the setting to be an extreme treble boost and volume increase — something that’s definitely not well-suited for music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Sound Leakage Reduction dials back high-pitched tones to avoid annoying your neighbors in the office or coffee shop. To me, this is the opposite of Voice Boost, removing the highs for a more mid- and bass-heavy tuning, but it doesn’t sound very good compared to the default setting. Plus, my family wasn’t really able to hear any leakage on the LinkBuds Clip anyway, unless I had the volume cranked uncomfortably high. I’ll also note that any EQ customization/presets and DSEE upscaling are only available in Standard (default) listening mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Open-fit earbuds typically struggle to muster adequate low-end tone, and the LinkBuds Clip meets the same fate. However, it’s not all bad in the audio department as these earbuds have great clarity and provide a solid soundstage so overall quality doesn’t suffer to the point of being unpleasant. The lack of bass is most apparent in booming genres, like hip-hop and synth-heavy electronic tunes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LinkBuds Clip doesn’t fare much better with more chaotic music styles like rock and metal. Spiritbox’s “Holy Roller” doesn’t have the depth that it does on closed-fit earbuds like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">AirPods Pro 3</a> or over-ear headphones like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Sony’s WH-1000XM6</a>. As such, the band’s songs aren’t nearly as immersive or impactful without adequate amounts of bass. So if pristine, enveloping sound quality is your primary aim, you’ll want to look elsewhere, and you’ll want to tread carefully with any other open-type earbuds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The open nature of the LinkBuds Clip makes them well-suited for calls. Since your ears aren’t plugged, you can clearly hear your own voice so you never feel like you need to shout. Sony says these earbuds have AI noise reduction and a bone conduction sensor for voice pickup, both of which are supposed to keep you sounding good. During the course of this review, I found the background noise reduction worked well without making me sound overly processed. However, the overall voice quality is average at best, which means you can get by with using these for calls, but there are better options if you really value clarity here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-life-on-the-linkbuds-clip">Battery life on the LinkBuds Clip</h2>
<p>When it comes to battery life, Sony says you can expect up to nine hours of use on a charge with up to 37 hours when you factor in the case. That means the LinkBuds Clip alone is enough to get you through a full workday, especially if you’re pausing for the occasional office chat or in-person meeting. And you’ll get more if you’re docking the earbuds in their case once or twice a day. If you do find yourself with a depleted battery though, a three-minute charge will give you an hour of play time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In multiple attempts at a full, nine-hour run down, I wasn’t able to hit Sony’s stated figure. In Standard mode with DSEE upscaling set to automatic and volume at about 60-70 percent, the LinkBuds Clip lasted just over six hours. This timeframe included a mix of music, podcasts and calls — typical work day activities. </p>

<p>Based on my testing, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</a> are still the best in this emerging clip-on category. However, they’re the bulkiest and the most expensive at $299. While they offer all the perks of open wear, sound quality can vary based on how they fit your ears and the lack of multipoint Bluetooth could be a deal breaker for some.&nbsp;</p>

I’ve only given these two a casual listen without any in-depth testing, so I won’t make a definitive call on which one stacks up best against the LinkBuds Clip. But they’re also just three of currently available options, and there are many more if none of these seem compelling.&nbsp;</p>

They’re plenty comfortable and exploit the benefits of open-type designs while doing basic earbud functionality well. Subpar bass performance and the omission of some of Sony’s more attractive features (and even some basic ones) mean the company hasn’t done enough to distinguish the Clip from the competition in an obvious way. Sure, these earbuds work as intended without being flashy or overly complicated, but there are plenty of other options that do that too.</p>
<p><strong>Update, January 21 2026, 4:45PM ET: </strong>After conducting additional battery testing, I still wasn’t able to meet the nine hour figure Sony promises. Due to this, I’ve adjusted the score from a 72 to a 70 to reflect the performance in this area. I’ve also updated the battery life section with more detailed impressions. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-linkbuds-clip-review-open-fit-benefits-arent-enough-to-stand-out-160000140.html?src=rss]]></description>

It has also offered grillers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-weber-connect-smart-grilling-hub-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a standalone option</a> for its Weber Connect platform. For 2026, the company is expanding its smart grilling lineup to its original fuel source: charcoal. Today, Weber announced the Performer Smart Charcoal Grill and Kettle Smart Ring, both of which bring Weber Connect control and cooking guidance to charcoal grilling in a more integrated way. </p><p>The 22-inch Performer Smart Charcoal Grill has a Wi-Fi-enabled LCD controller that regulates grill temperature by adjusting the airflow to lit charcoal. Weber says this grill is well-suited for overnight smoking and longer cooks thanks to this bit of automation. The new Performer also has a so-called Rapidfire Assist mode to get those coals lit faster. The grill can be controlled remotely with the Weber Connect app, which can also keep tabs on any connected food probes.  </p><p>The new Performer is essentially an upgraded version of the Performer Premium, Deluxe and base options that currently exist. You still get the porcelain-enamel finish, adjustable dampers for manual temperature controls and the One-Touch cleaning system for ash removal. The other upgrade is a Weber Works side table and side rail that accommodate the company’s line of accessories. A premium version comes with a cart with storage shelves for $799 while an option with a more basic cart will be $599. Weber also plans to sell non-smart versions for $649 and $449, respectively. The company says the base models will arrive this spring while the premium trims will be available this summer. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/weber-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/weber-2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Weber Kettle Smart Ring" data-uuid="e9c358e8-9be0-4e5f-99a8-4e100283628d"/><figcaption>Weber Kettle Smart Ring</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Weber Blackstone</div></figure><p>If you already have a Weber Kettle and are looking to add a bit of automation to your setup, the Kettle Smart Ring brings temperature control and smart connectivity for $280 this spring. This accessory fits the company’s 22-inch grills and is equipped with an LCD display and knob-based controls. Of course, it also syncs with the Weber Connect app and offers two slots for wired food probes. </p><p>Another key smart grilling area Weber lags behind its competition is wireless temperature probes, but that changes this spring. The company will debut a $70 Smart Wireless Probe and a $115 version with range booster and charger. These new probes sync with any Weber smart grill, the Weber Connect app or the new Smart Hub Display and Booster ($90) that works on any grill. Weber also built a retractable wired Smart Probe ($40) that can be used to monitor the temperature at the grates. </p><p>And if you’re loyal to propane, Weber has new options for you too. Updated Genesis Smart Gas Grills have a Sear Zone that can hit temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and a side table that now accommodates Weber Works accessories. It will be available in both propane and natural gas versions — in both three- and four-burner configurations — this spring starting at $999. More affordable Spirit Smart Gas Grills will start at $599 and will also come in three- and four-burner options. Both the Genesis and Spirit smart models work with the Weber Connect app like the rest of the company’s Wi-Fi grills and accessories. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/webers-2026-smart-grill-lineup-includes-the-companys-first-wi-fi-equipped-charcoal-grill-150000097.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The P9 boasts transfer speeds of up to 800MB/s, making moving games to the card that much faster. As for load times, in our testing we found that any microSD Express, the standard the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/"><ins>Switch 2</ins></a> requires, will offer roughly the same performance. This format is pretty new, so there aren&#39;t a ton of cards on the market. As such, the P9 makes our list of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html"><ins>best microSD cards</ins></a> for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the Steam Deck or any other gaming console that accepts the format, as well as cameras and more.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, Adobe <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/acrobat-studio-is-adobes-new-ai-powered-hub-for-pdfs-130003264.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">debuted Acrobat Studio</a>. The new service saw Adobe bring the humble PDF into the 21st century with support for a handful of new genAI features, including PDF Spaces, a hub where you can upload up to 100 documents and have AI summarize them. Now the company is enhancing the capabilities of those hubs with the introduction of four new genAI features inside of Adobe Acrobat, Acrobat Studio and Adobe Express.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time you add documents and files to a PDF Space, you can prompt Adobe&#39;s built-in AI assistant to generate a presentation from those materials. The software will first create an outline. From there, you can select from a handful of &quot;professional&quot; designs to build the presentation around, and then make tweaks. Adobe says the majority of changes, including copy edits and image swaps, can be made without the need to generate entirely new slides. Once you&#39;re happy with the results, you can share the presentation with your co-workers for further editing. Adobe has also made it easier to collaborate inside of PDF Spaces. With this latest update, you can invite others to add files and leave notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the subject of editing, you can now carry out a dozen different tweaks using natural-language prompts. That includes adding text, comments, images and e-signatures. If you&#39;re old-fashioned like me, Adobe has also reworked the Help section to offer step-by-step instructions on how to complete most tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, Adobe is borrowing a page from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-notebook-can-generate-a-podcast-about-your-notes-140004869.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">NotebookLM</a> by adding a feature that allows users to generate podcasts from a PDF Space. This works much like it does in Google&#39;s app. Acrobat will default to centering the generated podcast around two hosts having a conversation about the material you want summarized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Adobe says Acrobat&#39;s AI features have been highly popular, in part because users are finding those tools are saving them time. As you might expect, the company reports students have had a particularly strong response to its efforts to add AI inside of Acrobat, seeing as the app can generate summaries of course material while providing citations for fact checking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-acrobat-can-now-generate-presentations-and-audio-podcasts-from-your-documents-140000146.html?src=rss]]></description>

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from $160, while League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. We&#39;re almost halfway through the season at this point, so it makes sense for a service like League Pass to start offering some discounts.</p> 
<p>The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Last year, League Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html">added multiview</a>, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.</p> 
<p>Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.</p>

The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple&#39;s move from the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">iPhone 16 Pro</a> to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.</p><p>Qualcomm&#39;s new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qualcomms-new-flagship-mobile-platform-is-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-060427445.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip</a> is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251020054600003?input=1195m" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1"><em>Yonhap News</em> reports</a> Samsung&#39;s relatively new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/mobile-processor/exynos-2600/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Exynos 2600 chip</a> could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past.

</div><p>One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone&#39;s screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1994663953180627176?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">shared by leaker Ice Universe</a>, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn&#39;t changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it&#39;ll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.</p><p>The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2026/01/galaxy-s26-ultra-will-look-more-premium-than-the-s25-ultra.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">According to <em>Android Headlines</em></a>, the new phone&#39;s cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the disconcerting things about using a virtual private network (VPN) is that it can be hard to tell when it&#39;s doing its job. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPNs</a> all work in the background to keep your IP address hidden and your communications with their servers encrypted. The better the VPN, the less you notice it, which can make a top-performing VPN feel (uncomfortably) like one that isn&#39;t working at all.</p><p>Luckily, you&#39;ve got options for checking whether your VPN is working — other than just taking the app at its word. In this article, I&#39;ll cover the basics, then go through five different tests you can run to make sure you&#39;re actually using an encrypted VPN server. For each test, I&#39;ll explain what kind of problem it&#39;s looking for, how to run it and what to do in case it fails.</p><h2 id="jump-link-make-sure-your-vpn-is-turned-on"><strong>Make sure your VPN is turned on</strong></h2><p>Before you do anything else, though, it&#39;s not a bad idea to check your VPN app and make sure you remembered to connect. It&#39;s all too easy to open up the client app, choose a server, tweak some preferences and feel like your work is done. On top of that, we don&#39;t always remember to tell VPN beginners that simply opening the client isn&#39;t enough.</p><p>To check that your VPN is turned on, open the app on your desktop or mobile home screen. Each VPN designs its apps differently, but common signs include the color green, the word <strong>Connected </strong>and information on what server location you&#39;re connected to.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png" style="height:1872px;width:3407px;" alt="The main UI for Proton VPN, with the connection button visible at top-left and the server location menu below it." data-uuid="c0ecfb77-d3b2-4d75-b95e-1db966e6c94e"/><figcaption>The main UI for Proton VPN, with the connection button visible at top-left and the server location menu below it.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don&#39;t see anything like that, click the <strong>On button</strong>, which should be on the first page that appears when you log into the app. Most VPNs also connect whenever you click the name of a server location.</p><p>For those of you on iPhone or iPad, I&#39;ve just written <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-turn-off-a-vpn-on-iphone-180000533.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">an explainer</a> on how to turn a VPN off and on. For all the tests I&#39;ll discuss across the rest of this article, make sure you&#39;re connected to a VPN server before you run them. Also, make sure your internet connection is active — a VPN can only work when there&#39;s internet.</p><h2 id="jump-link-5-tests-to-check-if-your-vpn-works"><strong>5 tests to check if your VPN works</strong></h2><p>Each of these tests investigates a different reason your VPN might not be working. We&#39;ll start by looking for connection problems that might not be obvious, check for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks and IPv6 leaks, then finally make sure an apparently active VPN is managing to change your virtual location.</p><h3 id="jump-link-1-has-your-ip-address-changed"><strong>1. Has your IP address changed?</strong></h3><p>Websites and internet service providers (ISPs) use IP addresses to identify devices and their owners online. A VPN&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">most important job</a> is to change your IP address to one matching its own server, which disassociates your identity from your online activities. Not doing this indicates a failure on a fundamental level: either the VPN says it&#39;s connected when it isn&#39;t, or its technology is active but somehow not sending you through the proper encrypted tunnel.</p><p>To check whether your VPN has changed your IP address, start by going to an IP address checker like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://whatismyipaddress.com" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">whatismyipaddress.com</a></a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a></a>. This will show you the public IP address that everyone sees when you get online without a VPN, including the ISP that holds it and the geographic location it&#39;s associated with. Write that down or take a screenshot.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/whatismyipaddress_2970.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/whatismyipaddress_2970.png" style="height:1566px;width:2741px;" alt="A censored report from WhatIsMyIPAddress.com." data-uuid="14d6d71b-17e8-4dc4-b818-f191df970e09"/><figcaption>A censored report from WhatIsMyIPAddress.com.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Next, connect to your VPN. Remember the location you connect to, and note down the new server IP address if the VPN tells you what it is. Go back to your IP tester tool and refresh the page. You should now see an IP address and location that match the one you connected to through the VPN, including a different ISP.</p><p>If your IP address is the same as before, your VPN isn&#39;t working. To fix this, try disconnecting from the server, waiting about 10 seconds, then connecting to the same location and trying the test again. This will show you whether the problem was with one individual server or an entire location.</p><p>If the problem persists, try a different server location, then a different VPN protocol. If it&#39;s still leaking, try restarting your VPN client, your device and your modem (in that order). This should fix the problem, but if it doesn&#39;t, move on to the remaining tests or get in touch with the VPN&#39;s tech support.</p><h3 id="jump-link-2-are-you-leaking-dns-requests"><strong>2. Are you leaking DNS requests?</strong></h3><p>A domain name system (DNS) server is an important step in getting a website to appear on your browser. DNS holds the information that connects URLs to the IP addresses of destination servers. If a VPN client lets your device contact a DNS server owned by your internet service provider without routing it through an encrypted tunnel first, the DNS request might reveal your real IP address to the ISP.</p><p>You can check for DNS leaks by connecting to your VPN, then going to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://dnsleaktest.com" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">dnsleaktest.com</a></a> or another tool of your choice. The tester sends several innocuous DNS requests, then scans to see which servers resolve them. If you see your real ISP at all, you&#39;ve got DNS leaks.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dnsleaktest.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dnsleaktest.png" style="height:1645px;width:2028px;" alt="A DNS leak test run without a VPN. With one active, my real ISP (Comcast) should not appear on the list." data-uuid="a39c148b-99b7-45c9-893b-4f653005e5df"/><figcaption>A DNS leak test run without a VPN. With one active, my real ISP (Comcast) should not appear on the list.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>The fix for DNS leaks is more intensive than the fixes in step #1. Check your VPN&#39;s control panel to activate any DNS leak protections and try again. IPv6 leaks can also appear as DNS leaks, so try disabling IPv6 in your browser (see #4 below for instructions). If you keep seeing leaks, you can also try clearing your computer&#39;s DNS cache.</p><p>Here&#39;s how to do that. On Windows, go to the <strong>Command Prompt </strong>(on Windows 10) or the <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Terminal </strong>(on Windows 11). Enter the phrase <strong>ipconfig/flushdns.</strong> On Mac, open <strong>Terminal </strong>from the Utilities folder, then paste in the phrase <strong>sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder </strong>and hit Enter. Test the VPN once more to see if it&#39;s still leaking.</p><h3 id="jump-link-3-are-you-leaking-information-through-webrtc"><strong>3. Are you leaking information through WebRTC?</strong></h3><p>WebRTC, which stands for Web Real-Time Communication, is a technology that lets browsers exchange information directly with each other. This is useful for text and video chats, streaming and more, but it&#39;s also a potential security risk. WebRTC can serve as a backchannel that inadvertently sends your real IP address outside the VPN tunnel.</p><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to test for WebRTC leaks. I recommend the tool <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a></a>, which checks for them as a matter of course. You can also use <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://browserleaks.com/webrtc" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">browserleaks.com/webrtc</a> to run a test that&#39;s particular to this kind of leak. These tools establish dummy connections through WebRTC, then test to see if the VPN still works when they&#39;re active. As usual, if you see your real IP address, there&#39;s a problem.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WebRTC_leak_test.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WebRTC_leak_test.png" style="height:1900px;width:1976px;" alt="Your WebRTC IP not matching your Remote IP is a potential red flag." data-uuid="d9d0d002-3e53-4033-b50a-e9d74fba56aa"/><figcaption>Your WebRTC IP not matching your Remote IP is a potential red flag.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>The fixes for a WebRTC leak are the usual ones: try different servers, locations and protocols, reset your VPN, device and modem, then try another VPN provider. However, if nothing is working, you can also disable WebRTC on your browser altogether. This means you won&#39;t be able to do any real-time chatting (that&#39;s Zoom, Google Meet, Teams and so on), so it&#39;s a last-resort solution.</p><p>To disable WebRTC on Firefox, type <strong>about:config </strong>in the URL bar, click the message to accept the risk, type <strong>media.peerconnection.enabled </strong>in the search bar, then double-click the word <strong>True </strong>to change it to <strong>False. </strong>To turn WebRTC back on, just double-click <strong>False </strong>again.</p><p>On Edge, you can disable WebRTC by entering <strong>edge://flags </strong>in the URL bar, scrolling down to the option &quot;Anonymize local IPs exposed by WebRTC&quot; and making sure the dropdown next to it is set to <strong>Enable.</strong> There&#39;s no built-in way to turn off WebRTC on Chrome, but you can install the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webrtc-control/fjkmabmdepjfammlpliljpnbhleegehm?hl=en" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">WebRTC Control</a> extension to switch it off and on yourself.</p><h3 id="jump-link-4-is-your-ipv6-address-leaking"><strong>4. Is your IPv6 address leaking?</strong></h3><p>Next up, it&#39;s possible that your real location is leaking through your IPv6 address, not IPv4. To make a long explanation short, IPv6 is a new way of formatting IP addresses that leaves more options available for the future. Since we haven&#39;t yet hit the crisis point of IPv4 shortage, very few websites are restricted to IPv6 alone.</p><p>The problem is that most VPN apps were designed in the IPv4 era and aren&#39;t built to protect IPv6 traffic. There are some exceptions, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">NordVPN</a>, but most VPNs block IPv6 traffic completely rather than retrofit themselves to work with it. However, if a VPN of that sort isn&#39;t blocking IPv6 entirely, your IPv6 address and associated location can leak.</p><p>Any IP address checker can reveal an IPv6 leak, but you can find a specific test at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://test-ipv6.com" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">test-ipv6.com</a></a>. This site runs several exams that look for IPv6 readiness, but the most important line is the one that shows your current IPv6 address. This will probably say you don&#39;t have one, since most ISPs don&#39;t work through IPv6 yet — but if you do have one, it should match your active VPN&#39;s location, not your real one.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IPv6_leak_test.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IPv6_leak_test.png" style="height:1015px;width:3434px;" alt="If your IPv4 address matches the VPN server but your IPv6 address does not, IPv6 is the likely cause of your leak." data-uuid="0b0082f2-1dcb-4b24-bfe6-5425b4ab16c3"/><figcaption>If your IPv4 address matches the VPN server but your IPv6 address does not, IPv6 is the likely cause of your leak.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Should it turn out that you&#39;re leaking IPv6 requests, the easiest solution is to disable IPv6 on your computer. On Windows, you can do this through the network adapter options page of your control panel. Here&#39;s how to get there:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Windows 10: </strong>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network &amp; internet -&gt; Status -&gt; Change -&gt; Advanced network settings -&gt; Change adapter options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Windows 11: </strong>Settings app -&gt; Network &amp; internet -&gt; Advanced network settings -&gt; Related settings -&gt; More network adapter options.</p></li></ul><p>On both OSes, finish the job by right-clicking the name of your internet connection, selecting <strong>Properties </strong>from the dropdown and unchecking the box next to <strong>Internet Protocol Version 6</strong>. Of course, you can always switch to another VPN that blocks IPv6 altogether, but you might find that to be a bigger hassle.</p><p>If you&#39;re on Mac, open <strong>System Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Network </strong>tab and then click the <strong>Details... </strong>button next to your network name. In the new window, click the <strong>TCP/IP </strong>tab on the left, find the entry labeled <strong>Configure IPv6 </strong>and set the dropdown to <strong>Link-Local Only.</strong></p><h3 id="jump-link-5-do-streaming-sites-show-different-content"><strong>5. Do streaming sites show different content?</strong></h3><p>A VPN can be working perfectly and still fail to unblock streaming sites. Netflix, HBO Max and the others block VPN traffic because VPNs can make them show material in regions where they don&#39;t hold the copyright. To avoid legal trouble, they set up their firewalls to block IP addresses known to belong to VPN servers.</p><p>If your VPN can&#39;t get into a streaming platform, it&#39;ll usually be obvious; the site will either display a proxy error message or simply refuse to load. However, in rare cases, the streaming site will load fine but show you the same shows you normally see. This indicates that you might be dealing with a VPN leak.</p><p>If that happens, follow the usual steps. Disconnect and reconnect to the same location to get a different server, then try different server locations. It&#39;s also possible that the streaming site is getting your real location from your browser cache, so if the problem persists, clear your cache and cookies and try again.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-test-a-vpn-kill-switch"><strong>How to test a VPN kill switch</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s one more important step to make sure your VPN is working: test the kill switch. This common feature cuts off your internet connection if you lose touch with your VPN server. With your kill switch active, you shouldn&#39;t be at any risk of accidentally broadcasting your real IP address, location or online activity.</p><p>To test your kill switch, you&#39;ll need to simulate an abrupt loss of VPN connectivity. Open your VPN, make sure the kill switch is turned on, then connect to a server. Next, quit the VPN app without disconnecting. At this point, the kill switch should make it impossible for you to get online — if you can still browse the internet as normal, the switch might be faulty.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-latest-robot-vacuum-news">Latest robot vacuum news</h2> 
<p>CES is typically a time for robovac manufacturers to unveil new innovations and this year was no different. Companies like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ankers-ces-smart-home-lineup-includes-a-1600-eufy-robovac-160000133.html">Eufy</a> announced new models, many of which are on the higher end of the price spectrum. Those flagship announcements are often paired with more minor ones that usher in mildly upgraded versions of midrange and entry-level machines.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Now that robot vacuums are ubiquitous, the new models that make headlines tend to have some sort of gimmick like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html">a built-in arm for picking up clothes</a>, or offer (supposedly) top-tier suction power and a slew of extras. They also tend to be super expensive. However, most people will be served just fine with a robot vacuum that doesn’t choke at the first sign of dust bunnies or pet hair, and maybe has mopping capabilities if you want a machine that can tackle hard floors in addition to carpet. Those other innovations are nice-to-haves, not necessities.</p> 
<p>Arguably even bigger than CES announcements is the fact that iRobot, a name synonymous with smart cleaning robots, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> at the end of 2025. What does that mean for Roomba owners? Not too much immediately, as the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html">stated</a> that it will continue to operate with “no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships or ongoing product support.&quot; However, this also means that buying a new Roomba in 2026 is a questionable decision.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-robot-vacuums">What to look for in the best robot vacuums</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tldr">TLDR</h3> 
<p>Despite companies coming out with gimmicky extras and new software perks in their robot vacuum lineups, the core competency of these devices have remained the same for years: sucking up dirt without needing your attention. You want a robot vacuum with the strongest suction power you can afford. Those with tile and hardwood floors can consider robovacs with mopping capabilities, and those who want peak convenience should opt for a model with a self-emptying base. However, both of those extra features will cost extra.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-floor-type"><strong>Floor type</strong></h3> 
<p>First and foremost, we recommend considering the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into high piles more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power, but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vacuum-suction"><strong>Vacuum suction</strong></h3> 
<p>Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robovacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the machine can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wi-fi-connectivity"><strong>Wi-Fi connectivity</strong></h3> 
<p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, so it’s best to double check before you buy something on the low end of affordable. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mapping-features-and-object-detection"><strong>Mapping features and object detection</strong></h3> 
<p>Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features and improved object detection. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam.</p> 
<p>Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mopping-capabilities">Mopping capabilities</h3> 
<p>Mopping features are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines that support this will have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part.</p> 
<p>Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-self-empty-station-inclusion">Self-empty station inclusion</h3> 
<p>Finally, for peak convenience, consider a robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks.</p> 
<p>Just keep in mind that many self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in (look for mentions of “bagless” to avoid this all together). Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> 
<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to the insides.</p> 
<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards.</p> 
<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums">How we test robot vacuums</h2> 
<p>We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies, stairs (gasp) and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine.</p> 
<p>If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum&#39;s mobile app for usability and convenience. As we&#39;re testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-faqs">Robot vacuum FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h3> 
<p>We tackled this question when we reviewed <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuums</a> and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.</p> 
<p>That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-robot-vacuums-last">How long do robot vacuums last?</h3> 
<p>Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you&#39;re emptying the machine&#39;s bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum&#39;s filter needs changing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-robot-vacuums-work-better-than-handheld-vacuums">Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums?</h3> 
<p>There&#39;s no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-often-do-you-have-to-clean-a-robot-vacuum">How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum?</h3> 
<p>Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-negatives-of-robot-vacuums">What are the negatives of robot vacuums?</h3> 
<p>Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html">cordless stick vacuum</a>, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.</p>

The government argued that by acquiring apps it once competed with, Instagram and WhatsApp, the company had depressed competition in the space and ultimately hurt consumers. A trial last year saw testimony from several current and former executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, who <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-weve-learned-from-ftc-v-meta-antitrust-trial-162048138.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">spoke at length</a> about the pressure to compete with TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>US District Judge James Boasberg was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-won-the-antitrust-case-that-could-have-forced-it-to-spin-off-instagram-and-whatsapp-184320742.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ultimately persuaded</a> by Meta’s arguments, writing that the success of YouTube and TikTok prevented Meta from currently &quot;holding a monopoly&quot; even if the company had acted monopolistically in the past. If the FTC had won, it could have tried to force Meta to undo its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. Should it be successful in its appeal, that remedy could once again be on the table.</p><p>News of the FTC&#39;s plan to appeal is also a blow to Zuckerberg, who has spent the last year <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/zuckerberg-caught-on-hot-mic-telling-trump-i-wasnt-sure-how-much-to-promise-to-spend-on-ai-in-the-us-211915608.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">courting Trump</a> and hyping Meta&#39;s plans to spend <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-says-it-will-invest-600-billion-in-the-us-with-ai-data-centers-front-and-center-195000377.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">hundreds of billions</a> of dollars on AI infrastructure in the United States.
