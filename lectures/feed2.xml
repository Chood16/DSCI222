                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IKEA has officially announced its range of Matter-compatible smart home products. The Swedish furniture store is releasing 21 new items under the tentpoles of lighting, sensors and control. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-goes-all-in-on-matter-with-new-smart-home-products-144232740.html">IKEA teased these releases</a> back in July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the roll out will include updates to existing categories in order to work with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html">Matter</a>, an open source smart home standard. &quot;We&#39;re upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges,&quot; Stjepan Begic, product developer at IKEA. &quot;Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the products themselves, 11 come as part of the KAJPLATS smart bulb range. They will have a mix of shapes and sizes, along with dimming functionality. Then there&#39;s the five smart sensors., starting with an indoor and outdoor motion sensor called MYGGSPRAY, which automatically turns on lights. Similarly, there&#39;s MYGGBETT, which sends a notification when a door or window gets opened or closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the more technical safety side are sensors like TIMMERFLOTTE, which monitors temerature and humidity. Then there&#39;s ALPSTUGA, an air quality sensor and KLIPPBOK, a water leakage sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finishing the lineup is a range of remote controls and one smart plug, GRILLPLATS, which works with regular lamps and appliances to turn them on and off, along with tracking energy use. Then there&#39;s the four BILRESA products, starting with a dual button remote control that can turn lights on and off, adjust the brightness, and create a preset scene. Meanwhile, the remote control with a scroll wheel does similar functions, along with dimming. Two kits of three controls each are available for each type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-and-ikea-end-their-partnership-130052348.html">IKEA</a> doesn&#39;t include exact pricing or release dates, noting that it might vary market to market. In its July teaser, the company said these products would be available come January next year.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-announces-new-matter-compatible-smart-home-products-120013040.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Wi-Fi mesh system is one of the best upgrades you can make to improve your home’s internet coverage, especially if you’ve ever struggled with dead zones, buffering or dropped video calls. Unlike a single router that broadcasts from one central point, a mesh system uses multiple access points spread throughout your space to blanket your entire home with a strong, seamless Wi-Fi signal. Whether you&#39;re working on multiple laptops, streaming 4K video in the living room or gaming online in the basement, a mesh setup helps ensure you get reliable Wi-Fi wherever you are.<br><br>These systems are designed to handle the demands of modern households, offering features like dual-band or even tri-band connectivity to balance your bandwidth across devices, and automatic updates to keep your firmware current. Many also support high-speed internet plans and include options for a wired connection if you need extra stability for gaming or work. With easy setup, smart app controls and long-term future-proofing, the best mesh Wi-Fi router systems can eliminate the need for clunky Wi-Fi extenders and give you fast, dependable Wi-Fi connections across your whole home.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-mesh-wi-fi-system"><strong>What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system</strong></h2>
<p>Linksys’ CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an “advancement in Wi-Fi technology” over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn’t ideal. “You can have a small [home], but there’s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,” he said.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Historically, the solution to a home’s Wi-Fi dead zone was to buy a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html">Wi-Fi extender</a> but Bettino said the hardware has both a “terrible user experience” and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh Wi-Fi, by comparison, offers “multiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,” says Bettino, resulting in “ubiquitous Wi-Fi” that feels as if you have a “router in every room.”</p>
<p>Rather than having one main router in your home, having a “router in every room” is the biggest selling point for mesh Wi-Fi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your connected devices. There’s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to.</p>
<p>It’s a good time to buy a mesh Wi-Fi system since the latest standard, Wi-Fi 6E, represents a big leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco&#39;s Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big “inflection point,” using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. “If you’re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],” he said, “you’re going to get significant gains [in speed.]”</p>
<p>MacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely “carry you for a long time” thanks to the fact its “top throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.” In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-do-all-these-wi-fi-numbers-and-letters-mean">What do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean?</h3>
<p><em>I’m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it’s worth it.</em></p>
<p>Wi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on.</p>
<p>Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we’re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-wi-fi-6-and-wi-fi-6e">What’s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E?</h3>
<p>Wi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That’s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn’t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-youre-going-to-talk-about-wireless-frequencies-now-arent-you">You’re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren’t you.</h3>
<p>Each Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren’t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it’s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-so-what-am-i-looking-for">So, what am I looking for?</h3>
<p>Right now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it’s what we think it’s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone’s at-home Wi-Fi needs.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-wi-fi-7">What about Wi-Fi 7?</h3>
<p>We’re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don’t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there’s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it’s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home’s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I’d estimate you won’t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-range-and-speed"><strong>Range and speed</strong></h3>
<p>All Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality — but these figures don’t mean much. After all, manufacturers can’t control your ISP’s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn’t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you’ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won’t need a mesh router that offers that spec.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-backhaul"><strong>Backhaul</strong></h3>
<p>Mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination.</p>
<p>To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity"><strong>Connectivity</strong></h3>
<p>These days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips’ Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter.</p>
<p>It’s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it’s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses — if it’s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router’s specs via the manufacturer’s website to be sure.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-flexibility-and-scalability"><strong>Flexibility and scalability</strong></h3>
<p>Mesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link’s Alan Jones said users should “check how scalable the prospective product is” before you buy. This sense of scale doesn’t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle.</p>
<p>It’s also worth looking at ASUS’ AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard “spider” Wi-Fi routers. If you’ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-placement"><strong>Placement</strong></h3>
<p>Mesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don’t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-other-mesh-wi-fi-router-systems-we-tested">Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested</h2>
<h3 id="jump-link-amazon-eero-pro-7">Amazon Eero Pro 7</h3>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/eero-pro-7-review-paying-to-be-sold-a-subscription-171502767.html">Eero</a> built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company’s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-amazon-eero-6e">Amazon Eero 6E</h3>
<p>Eero Pro 6E is an “easy” device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There’s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-netgear-orbi-960">Netgear Orbi 960</h3>
<p>The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It&#39;s a fantastic piece of gear, but it&#39;s worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-wi-fi-routers">How we test Wi-Fi routers</h2>
<p>My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors.</p>
<p>For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place.</p>
<p>Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-mesh-wi-fi-system-faqs">Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs</h2>
<p>This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-wi-fi-router-and-a-mesh-router">What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router?</h3>
<p>A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade.</p>
<p>That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-wi-fi-extender-and-a-mesh-system">What&#39;s the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system?</h3>
<p>Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and <em>I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time</em>. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-wireless-backhaul">What is a wireless backhaul?</h3>
<p>As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination.</p>
<p>To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-is-it-better-to-hard-wire-instead-of-using-a-mesh-wi-fi-system">Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system?</h3>
<p>This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer.</p>
<p>It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors.</p>
<p>If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds.</p>
<p>But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill.</p>
<p>When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last time I used a set of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Noble Audio</a> earbuds, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-fokus-rex5-review-incredible-sound-if-youre-willing-to-pay-for-it-130043824.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">managed to pack five drivers</a> into the tiny housings. Now it’s back with a new model, the FoKus Prestige Encore, and despite only having four drivers this time, the company still took plenty of cues from its line of pro-grade in-ear monitors (IEMs). The biggest downside is that this new set is still plenty pricey, hitting your wallet for $699. </p>
<p>Inside, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://nobleaudio.com/collections/wireless-monitors" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">FoKus Prestige Encore</a> has one 8mm dynamic driver, two balanced armature drivers and one 6mm planar magnetic driver. According to Noble, each of these components have different duties. The dynamic drivers handle bass while the midrange goes to the Knowles balanced armature drivers. Lastly, the planar magnetic driver is tasked with the treble to “reveal microdetail.” The company says it also designed new “triple-vented” nozzles to make airflow efficient and the seal consistent. </p>

<p>Rather than using plastic or some other affordable material, Noble opted for solid wood for both the earbud housings and the charging case. Since this is the real thing and not a printed plate, each set of the FoKus Prestige Encore will have its own unique grain pattern — no two sets will look the same. What’s more, Noble reduced the overall size of the buds, which it says offers “a secure, fatigue-free fit.” </p>
<p>The FoKus Prestige Encore is equipped with hybrid active noice cancellation (ANC) and a transparency mode. The earbuds also support aptX Lossless, aptX Adaptive and LDAC for higher quality listening. For calls, dual noise suppression mics won’t overly process your voice for the sake of reducing background distractions, which Noble says will keep you sounding clear and natural in all settings. </p>
<p>Noble promises up to seven hours of use on a charge with ANC enabled or up to 10 hours with noise canceling turned off. When you factor in the case, you’re looking at up to 35 hours of total listening time. A quick-charge features will give you up to two hours of playback. The FoKus Prestige Encore also supports Audiodo for personalized calibration for each user’s hearing, and those profiles are stored on the earbuds for use on any device. </p>
<p>The Fokus Prestige Encore is available starting today for $699 (£649/€799).</p>

Plenty have chosen VOD and<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html"> live TV streaming services</a> over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now.

<p>We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don&#39;t want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0">who Pepe Silvia is</a> when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart</a>, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

However, it comes at a relatively high price and lacks a stacked or partially stacked sensor, unlike other cameras in this category.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new 32.5MP sensor provides a big boost in resolution compared to the R6 II's 24MP chip. At the same time, the R6 III offers higher shooting speeds of 40 fps in burst mode with the electronic shutter, or 12 fps with the mechanical or first-curtain shutter. It also supports 20 frames (a half second) of pre-shooting so you won't miss key moments for wildlife or sports shooting.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The R6 III uses Canon's fast and dependable Dual Pixel AF system and comes with the company's latest AI tracking algorithms. It can operate in fairly dim conditions down to -6 EV and should be more responsive with Canon's latest Digic X processor, pending our review. It offers subject tracking for people, animals and vehicles, along with an Auto mode that will pick one of those automatically. It also borrowed the "Register People Priority" feature from the R5 II, which lets you keep focus locked on specific subjects that you've previously memorized.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The biggest update for the R6 III, though, is with video. Thanks to the higher resolution sensor, it can now capture up to 7K 60 fps RAW light video, 7K 30 fps "open gate" video and 4K at up to 120 fps, all with Canon's C-Log2 and C-Log3 on tap. There's a dizzying array of other video formats available (12 pages worth in the specs), with HEVC S, AVC-S, RAW, RAW Light and others, at resolutions up to 7K. All the AF subject detection features are available (vehicles, animals and people), and Canon is typically among the best for video AF in terms of speed and accuracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nobody expects any radical design changes in a Canon camera (the company tried that with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-12-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-review.html">EOS R</a> and it <em>really</em> didn't work), so the R6 III kept the last model's tried and true form factor. That includes two adjustment dials on the top and one on the rear, along with a joystick, photo/video selector, mode dial and a good assortment of programmable buttons.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The rear display flips out as you'd expect for vlogging, but it doesn't tilt like Panasonic's S1 II — so it may obstruct the mic or headphone jacks, and isn't as useful for low-angle photo shooting. The viewfinder has 3.69 million dots of resolution as before, the same as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">Sony's A7 IV</a> but less than Panasonic's slightly more expensive <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/panasonic-s1-ii-review-a-near-perfect-creators-camera-if-money-is-no-object-174509182.html">Lumix S1 II</a>. One big change is the addition of a CFexpress card slot that allows RAW video capture and faster burst speeds, along with an SD UHS II slot. The battery is the same as the one for <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-eos-r5-ii-review-canons-most-powerful-camera-yet-puts-sony-on-notice-160013865.html">EOS R5 II</a> and allows up to 390 shots (CIPA rating) with the viewfinder enabled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other features include waveform monitoring that will be much appreciated by pros, plus new focus speed algorithms borrowed from Canon's cinema cameras that offer "natural, professional" behavior, the company wrote. Inputs include 3.5mm mic and headphone jacks, along with high-speed USB-C and a full-sized HDMI port. In-body stabilization has been boosted slight from 8 to 8.5 stops, matching the latest Panasonic models.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Along with the EOS R6 III, Canon introduced some interesting new glass.

<p>The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it&#39;s technically just a 13-inch panel. There&#39;s support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.</p> 
<p>This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There&#39;s no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html">released the MacBook Pro M5</a>, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

With the partnership, Perplexity&#39;s AI search engine will be a prominent part of Snapchat&#39;s &quot;chat&quot; interface so users can &quot;ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat.&quot;</p><p>The news was announced alongside the company&#39;s third-quarter earnings. The company said that revenue from the deal — Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million for the integration — is &quot;expected to begin contributing&quot; to the company&#39;s bottom line in 2026. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://investor.snap.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Investor-Letter.pdf" data-i13n="slk:a letter;cpos:2;pos:1">a letter</a> to shareholders, CEO Evan Spiegel also hinted that Snap could pursue similar partnerships with other AI companies. &quot;This collaboration makes AI-powered discovery native to Snapchat, enhances personalization, and positions Snap as a leading distribution channel for intelligent agents, laying the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of AI partners to reach our global community,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Snap, like its peers, has been leaning into generative AI in recent years. The company has its own LLM-powered chatbot, called MyAI, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-is-redesigning-snapchat-and-adding-new-ai-powers-171552703.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">uses models</a> from OpenAI, Google and, soon, Perplexity AI. Snap has also introduced AI-powered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-launches-generative-ai-video-lenses-130056731.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">lenses</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-now-has-a-standalone-app-for-making-gen-ai-augmented-reality-effects-170036214.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">creation tools</a>, which have helped boost its Snapchat+ subscription service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spiegel also teased other AI-powered updates coming to Snapchat. He said the company is working on a new AI video generation feature called &quot;AI Clips&quot; that &quot;will allow creators to generate short, shareable videos from simple prompts.&quot; He didn’t say when the feature might launch.</p><p>Outside of Snapchat, Snap is also planning on launching a new version of its AR glasses, called Specs, s<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">ometime next year</a>. Spiegel didn’t offer any new details about the device, which he has previously promised will be lighter-weight than the current version. He did, however, suggest the company was considering working with potential hardware partners.  He said Snap would be “putting Specs into their own standalone, 100% owned subsidiary” to give the company more flexibility to pursue such arrangements. </p><p><strong>Update, November 5, 2025,  3:08PM PT:</strong> Added more details from Snap’s earnings call.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-and-perplexity-sign-400-million-deal-to-put-ai-search-directly-in-snapchat-221101734.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hilarious co-op video game <em>Overcooked</em> is making the move to the real world. A24 has acquired the rights to the popular indie hit and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports that the company is working with Netflix to develop the concept into an unscripted competition reality TV series. I adore this idea, and with the right people behind it, I think it could be a masterwork of reality TV. According to the reports, this is the first time independent film and TV studio A24 will make a reality show, but Netflix has already had some success with food and cooking programs, such as with the absolute gem that is <em>Nailed It!</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The often ridiculous antics of <em>Overcooked</em> are a wonderful match for that type of lighthearted competition show. In the game, one to four players work together to cook customers&#39; food orders as quickly as possible while the environment creates silly, unexpected obstacles. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way the Netflix legal team will green light challenges where contestants might fall into actual lava, and recreating the space travel levels would probably blow the budget. But I can see all sorts of <em>Overcooked</em>-style mayhem from sliding on icy floors or suddenly moving countertops. I’m also imagining a lot of dashing between inconveniently placed kitchen appliances and occasionally plunging the contestants into total darkness. There’s no timeline given in <em>Deadline</em>’s report, but I cannot wait for this to exist. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/co-op-game-overcooked-may-become-a-competition-reality-tv-show-on-netflix-222406920.html?src=rss]]></description>

Instead, the app is an AI-powered &quot;DJ&quot; that can deliver contextual audio updates to your ears as you move through your day.&nbsp;</p><p>Crowley describes BeeBot as an &quot;app for AirPods,&quot; though it will work with any type of headphones, as well as smart glasses with audio capabilities like Meta&#39;s. &quot;Whenever you put your AirPods in, it turns on,&quot; Crowley explains in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://dens.medium.com/say-hello-to-dj-beebot-592cdc1f1704" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a post</a> on Medium. &quot;Whenever you take your AirPods out it turns off. And when it’s &#39;on&#39; it’ll push you snippets of audio about the people, places, and events that are nearby.&#39;</p><p>To do this, you&#39;ll need to give the app access to your location and share a handful of &quot;keywords&quot; about your interests. You can also share your contacts to get updates from friends who are using the app. The BeeBot &quot;DJ,&quot; which of course has an AI voice, will then be able to talk to you as you throughout the dat and alert you to interesting events, landmarks or updates from friends who happen to be nearby.&nbsp;</p><div><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:400px;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/qtKztQ8e" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><p>In some ways, it sounds like Crowley is trying to re-create some of the serendipitous IRL social interactions enabled by the original version of Foursquare. BeeBot doesn&#39;t have &quot;mayorships,&quot; badges or any of the gamification features that helped popularize FourSquare, but it&#39;s meant to have some of the &quot;same playful spirit,&quot; of OG Foursquare, according to Crowley. (Foursquare <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/foursquare-is-killing-its-city-guide-app-to-focus-on-the-check-in-app-swarm-191054153.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shut down</a> its city guide app of the same name earlier this year, though its check-in app, Swarm, lives on.)</p><p>&nbsp;And, because it&#39;s 2025, there&#39;s also a whole bunch of AI thrown in, including &quot;a mix of different LLMs&quot; and &quot;synthetic voices.&quot; The app is &quot;powered by a TikTok-style algorithm,&quot; Crowley says, &quot;but one that’s focused on what’s happening nearby and IRL.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>There also seems to be a bit of DNA <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-24-foursquare-marsbot-text-bot-food.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">from Marsbot</a>, the short-lived (and IMO very underrated) chat-based app Foursquare launched in 2016 that could proactively provide personalized restaurant recommendations. While BeeBot isn&#39;t as heavily focused on neighborhood recommendations as Foursquare, it is meant to proactively let you know about nearby happenings you might be interested in or even a bit of gossip from friends. In addition to friends&#39; status updates, the app will draw on local Substacks and newsletters for relevant info about a given area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crowley says the DJ&#39;s audio cues may &quot;occasionally&quot; interrupt your music or podcast to give an update, though users should expect to hear these only a couple times throughout the day. BeeBot won&#39;t interrupt voice or video calls.&nbsp;</p><p>BeeBot, which is the inaugural project of Crowley&#39;s new company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hopscotchlabs.co/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Hopscotch Labs</a>, is out now in the App Store, though it&#39;s still &quot;very much a work in progress,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@dens/post/DQrtmYhEUu4" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">according to</a> Crowley. &quot;I feel like the version of the product we’re sharing with folks today is kind of where Foursquare was when it launched at SXSW in 2009 – an interesting vision, a good-enough execution, but something that still needs to be shaped by the people using it to fully blossom.&quot; </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-foursquare-founders-new-app-is-an-ai-powered-dj-for-neighborhood-updates-202326296.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The company promises a &quot;sleek&quot; new look, but that&#39;s not the only change. This visual redesign should make it much easier to quickly glance at recent songs you&#39;ve identified via the Home tab. They now appear directly on the home screen.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a revamped toolbar that lets you quickly swap between different tabs, including one that lists nearby concerts. The search icon is now separated into its own button on the bottom of the app.</p>

Google tried to <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-asks-supreme-court-to-rescue-it-from-its-epic-lawsuit-195555490.html">ask the Supreme Court</a> to block the injunction Donato handed down, which required the company to make major changes to the Play Store, while it appealed the case again. But the Supreme Court <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/supreme-court-denies-googles-request-to-pause-play-store-changes-while-it-appeals-epic-case-121502132.html">denied its request</a>. That means Google will be prohibited from paying manufacturers and app developers to exclusively install and distribute on the Play Store, respectively. It will also be prohibited from forcing developers to only use its payment system, and it will have to allow third-party app stores to be installed on Android devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google will still have to follow most of Donato&#39;s orders under the proposal, but the companies made some modifications. To start with, they&#39;ve worked out how to &quot;allow developers and users to seamlessly use alternative payment mechanisms,&quot; both in-app and via external links, while adhering to Google&#39;s security and safety standards. They&#39;ve also specified the maximum fees Google can charge for both in-app and linked transactions, which are 9 percent or 20 percent, depending on the type of transaction. This fee cap also depends on when the app in question was installed. Specifically, the commission caps on third party in-app payment systems would only apply to new app installs.</p>
<p>The companies have identified &quot;reasonable, neutral criteria&quot; that third-party stores would be required to meet, as well. Users will easily be able to download stores that meet those criteria so they can compete against the Play Store and each other around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samat said that the companies are meeting with Judge Donato on Thursday, and if he approves of the proposal, it &quot;would resolve [the] litigations.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Update, November 5, 2025, 2:22PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated with more details on how the fee caps for in-app purchases and linked transactions work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-and-epic-games-reach-settlement-for-antitrust-lawsuit-120019374.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony AI released a dataset that tests the fairness and bias of AI models. It&#39;s called the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced like &quot;Phoebe&quot;). The company describes it as the &quot;first publicly available, globally diverse, consent-based human image dataset for evaluating bias across a wide variety of computer vision tasks.&quot; In other words, it tests the degree to which today&#39;s AI models treat people fairly. Spoiler: Sony didn&#39;t find a single dataset from any company that fully met its benchmarks.</p>
<p>Sony says FHIBE can address the AI industry&#39;s ethical and bias challenges. The dataset includes images of nearly 2,000 paid participants from over 80 countries. All of their likenesses were shared with consent — something that can&#39;t be said for the common practice of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-investigating-perplexity-ai-after-accusations-it-scrapes-websites-without-consent-133003374.html">scraping large volumes of web data</a>. Participants in FHIBE can remove their images at any time. Their photos include annotations noting demographic and physical characteristics, environmental factors and even camera settings.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tool &quot;affirmed previously documented biases&quot; in today&#39;s AI models. But Sony says FHIBE can also provide granular diagnoses of factors that led to those biases. One example: Some models had lower accuracy for people using &quot;she/her/hers&quot; pronouns, and FHIBE highlighted greater hairstyle variability as a previously overlooked factor.</p>
<p>FHIBE also determined that today&#39;s AI models reinforced stereotypes when prompted with neutral questions about a subject&#39;s occupation. The tested models were particularly skewed &quot;against specific pronoun and ancestry groups,&quot; describing subjects as sex workers, drug dealers or thieves. And when prompted about what crimes an individual committed, models sometimes produced &quot;toxic responses at higher rates for individuals of African or Asian ancestry, those with darker skin tones and those identifying as &#39;he/him/his.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Sony AI says FHIBE proves that ethical, diverse and fair data collection is possible. The tool is now <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fairnessbenchmark.ai.sony/">available to the public</a>, and it will be updated over time. A paper outlining the research was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09716-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em> on Wednesday.</p>

The deal applies to multiple colorways.</p> 
<p>The Charge 6 topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html"><ins>best fitness trackers</ins></a>, and for good reason. It features built-in GPS, which means it doesn&#39;t have to be tethered to a phone when doing some cardio. The heart rate monitor is much more accurate when compared to the Charge 5 and the battery lasts a full week before requiring a trip to the outlet.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="d0295a14e36f408aa37cce995dab6c3c" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>All told, it tracks 20 exercise types, in addition to sleep. The Charge 6 features a full-color AMOLED display that&#39;s easy on the eyes and a relatively thin design. This makes it feel fairly premium, especially when compared to rival devices.</p> 
<p>On the downside, there&#39;s no real integration with Apple Health. This could be a dealbreaker for some. Also, some health data is hidden behind a Fitbit Premium paywall. That service costs $10 each month.</p> 
<p>This isn&#39;t the only Fitbit product on sale right now.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The outlook for future generations isn&#39;t looking so great. The UN <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/48854;jsessionid=D23E0658FE54E97267B6D6450843FD4B" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">released</a> its annual Emissions Gap Report on Tuesday, and the news is mostly bad. The world’s projected climate path falls far short of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-12-climate-change-deal-final-draft.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Paris Agreement targets</a>. Although the 2025 projections are slightly better than last year&#39;s, some of that improvement is due to the report&#39;s methodological changes. The UN also notes that the upcoming <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/president-trump-withdraws-the-us-from-the-paris-climate-agreement-again-002803951.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement</a> will basically cancel that out.</p><p>The UN measures progress based on projections of rising temperatures (relative to pre-industrial levels) by 2030. The Paris Agreement&#39;s goals are to limit that to 2 degrees Celsius (while pursuing a path to 1.5 degrees C). The current projections are well above both numbers: 2.3 to 2.5 degrees C.</p><p>Those numbers compare to 2.5 to 2.8 degrees C in last year&#39;s report, but the improvement is partially chalked up to methodological changes. The report states that the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in January 2026 will wipe out around 0.1 degrees C of progress.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/matt-palmer-kbTp7dBzHyY-unsplash.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/matt-palmer-kbTp7dBzHyY-unsplash.jpg" style="height:5304px;width:7952px;" alt="Wildfires" data-uuid="46e6b00d-b101-4646-83af-078755e6d4c4"><figcaption>Wildfires</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Matt Palmer / Unsplash</div></figure><p>Getting the temperature rise down to 1.5 degrees C by 2100 is still possible, but it appears increasingly unlikely. To get there, the world would need to cut emissions by 55 percent by 2035. Meanwhile, to achieve 2 degrees C of warming by 2030, those cuts would need to reach 35 percent. As the report bleakly puts it, national pledges and the current geopolitical situation &quot;do not provide promising signs that this will happen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Given the size of the cuts needed, the short time available to deliver them and a challenging political climate, a higher exceedance of 1.5 degrees C will happen, very likely within the next decade,&quot; the UN says. The best hope for reaching the long-term goals now lies in reversing that change after the fact. However, that carries the risk of crossing &quot;irreversible climate tipping points,&quot; such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-28-antarctica-ice-sheet-cracking.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet</a>.</p><p>Of course, rising temperatures alone aren&#39;t the only things to worry about. Cascading effects would include crop losses (and food insecurity), water scarcity, wildfires, coastal flooding and coral reef collapse. You also can&#39;t ignore the geopolitical implications, as desperate migrants flee uninhabitable regions, crowding the more livable ones.</p><p>A small silver lining is that solar and wind energy development has exceeded expectations, making their expansion easier and cheaper. The UN notes that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-worlds-largest-direct-carbon-capture-plant-just-went-online-172447811.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">CO2 removal tech</a> could eventually help supplement policy changes, but that approach is &quot;uncertain, risky and costly.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/un-emissions-report-the-planet-is-falling-well-short-of-its-climate-targets-184255639.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a> is useful in several ways — a good one can stream foreign TV shows and events, save you from giving up information to hackers and keep you anonymous to protect against online tracking. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. VPN pricing can be opaque, and providers don't always portray their best deals accurately.</p>
<p>Even so, there are genuinely great bargains on the table. VPN providers give out deep discounts to customers who sign up for a year or more at a time. This lets them boost their subscriber numbers, but it's a win for you as well — while you pay out more upfront, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

The nation&#39;s law, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/australia-is-one-step-away-from-banning-social-media-for-under-16s-160454882.html" data-i13n="slk:blocks children under 16 from major social media sites;cpos:2;pos:1">blocks children under 16 from major social media sites</a>, is scheduled to go into effect on December 10.</p><p>Alongside Reddit, Wells said Australian streaming site Kick would also be included.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discord has been trying to strike a balance between affording teen users their privacy and allowing for parental oversight. Over the next week, the platform is rolling out some updates for its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-family-center-tool-gives-parents-better-insight-into-their-teens-discord-usage-150014579.html" data-i13n="slk:Family Center;cpos:1;pos:1">Family Center</a> with the aim of helping parents gain more understanding of what their teens are doing on Discord, while giving them the ability to manage certain settings.&nbsp;</p><p>Parents and guardians were already able to see an overview of some of their teens&#39; Discord activity. Now, they&#39;ll be able to view all purchases for the previous seven days; exactly how long teens have spent in voice and video calls across direct messages, servers and group DMs; and the five users and servers that a teen has called and messaged most often over the last week.</p><p>Teens will have the option to notify a guardian when they report another user or a piece of content to Discord. The guardian will receive an email telling them that their teen filed a report but not the details. The idea behind that is to have a conversation about the report and for the guardian to lend their support.</p><p>In addition, Discord is adding guardian-managed settings to Family Center. These include the ability to determine who can DM a teen and if sensitive content filters are enabled. Guardians will have access to some data privacy controls too.</p><p>Discord said it designed the updates with teens in mind and to make sure they can maintain their independence while having the parental support they might need. Guardians can&#39;t see the content of messages that their teens send. Teens can also view the same information as their guardians in Family Center.&nbsp;</p><p>To use Family Center, guardians and teens need to link their accounts. They can do so by going to <strong>User Settings &gt; Family Center </strong>in the Discord app.</p><p>As with other social platforms, Discord is under the spotlight when it comes to the safety of young users. Earlier this year, New Jersey&#39;s attorney general <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/new-jersey-ag-sues-discord-over-alleged-child-safety-failures-184501604.html" data-i13n="slk:sued Discord;cpos:2;pos:1">sued Discord</a>, claiming that it &quot;misled parents about the efficacy of its safety controls and obscured the risks children faced when using the application.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update, November 5, 2025, 1:01PM ET:</strong> A previous version of this story indicated that Australia was considering banning under 16s from using Discord. This is not the case, as Discord <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/which-platforms-are-age-restricted" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">will not be considered</a> an age-restricted social media platform by Australian officials.

To remedy that, Atari and developer Digital Eclipse are releasing another paid expansion for the retro collection.

The expansion features versions of <em>Pac-Man </em>for Atari 2600, Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit. <em>Pac-Man </em>was the best-selling game on Atari 2600, but it&#39;s safe to say that version doesn&#39;t exactly hold up.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCPpgt0s70U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The Namco Legendary Pack also includes the US arcade versions of <em>Dig Dug</em> and <em>Xevius. </em>In addition, you’ll get home console versions of those two games, <em>Galaga </em>and <em>Galaxian</em>. </p><p>The DLC will make <em>Atari 50 </em>even more of a comprehensive overview of the company&#39;s history.

<p>To rewind, Meta revamped its teen-specific accounts — which were first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-teen-accounts-with-parental-controls-will-be-mandatory-for-kids-under-16-120013852.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> last year — last month, claiming that going forward the account content would be guided by PG-13 movie ratings. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/instagram-teen-accounts-pg-13-ratings/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> explaining the change, it said: &quot;Just like you might see some suggestive content or hear some strong language in a PG-13 movie, teens may occasionally see something like that on Instagram — but we’re going to keep doing all we can to keep those instances as rare as possible.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Engadget’s Karissa Bell <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-makes-teen-accounts-more-restrictive-120000653.html"><ins>pointed out</ins></a> at the time, while Meta openly acknowledged that no system is without its flaws, the analogy is a bit vague and confusing, especially as the company has tightened up some of its rules so that teens are no longer supposed to see any &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; content on the app. This is despite content of that nature often being present in a PG-13 movie.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Teenage Engineering <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://teenage.engineering/products/ep-40"><ins>just revealed the EP-40 Riddim sampler</ins></a>. This reggae-inspired groovebox is another redesign of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineerings-ko-ii-groovebox-is-feature-rich-and-only-300-164933466.html"><ins>pre-existing EP-133 KO II sampler</ins></a>. It has the same square body and button-based workflow, but there are several changes here.</p>
<p>First of all, the entire exterior has been redesigned to make that reggae theme really pop. It&#39;s green and off-white, with fun fonts aplenty. The thing just screams &quot;play me,&quot; much like the original KO II.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e9314f9c00f547fd913a29650680c7e9"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IV6G0I_VBCk?si=K4nmFOu8UZhn9xwQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest internal feature is the addition of an actual synth engine called Supertone. The previous models in this series were just samplers. The company promises that this engine can deliver thick bass sounds and classic leads. It also offers access to a dub-inspired siren mode that&#39;s pressure sensitive. It oscillates faster the harder you press it.</p>
<p>The machine also boasts double the storage and an additional main effect. All told, there are seven main effects and 12 punch-in effects. These have all been inspired by reggae tunes. It comes pre-loaded with hundreds of samples which have also primarily been pulled from the genre.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just for reggae, as sounds are sounds and people can do whatever they want with them. Also, it&#39;s really easy to load your own samples into this machine via a web tool. I&#39;ve used the tool often with the original KO II and it truly is drag-and-drop.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one final fascinating element here. The sampler ships with something called the EP-2350 Ting microphone. This handheld mic resembles something out of a CB radio and is &quot;lo-fi by design.&quot; It features four voice-changing effects, including one that combines echo and spring reverb. This is an essential effect for dub reggae vocals. In theory, this microphone could be used with other devices, but it&#39;s only available as a combo pack with the Riddim.</p>
<p>Everything else is in line with the KO II. It has a speaker that&#39;ll likely be pretty crappy, but also plenty of inputs and outputs. It operates via AA batteries and there are 12 buttons to trigger samples.</p>
<p>The Riddim is slightly more expensive than its counterparts, at $329. However, this does include the aforementioned Ting microphone. It&#39;s available right now for purchase.</p>

<p>It doesn't look like Disney-owned channels including ABC and ESPN will be returning to YouTube TV anytime soon. The Walt Disney Co. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html">pulled its channels from YouTube TV</a> as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement and the spat is showing no signs of a resolution yet. While big sporting events are often where the rubber meets the road on these channel blackouts, YouTube TV subscribers were unable to see any college football games on ABC or ESPN all weekend, and a number of tonight's NBA games are going to be affected, too. YouTube TV management <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-response-to-disneys-request-to-restore-abc/">officially rebuffed Disney's request</a> for a 24-hour restoration of its channels in a blog post on Monday — ostensibly to offer coverage of Tuesday's elections — proposing instead that Disney reactivate the feeds for ABC and ESPN while negotiations continue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>YouTube TV had previously stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. (Some users<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/streaming/articles/youtube-tv-users-10-credit-175300340.html"> have reportedly noticed an option for $10 off </a>in their accounts.) This discount provides little consolation though if you want to watch tonight's NBA games or your favorite shows like <em>Abbott Elementary</em>, <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> and <em>Dancing with the Stars.</em> If you don't want to miss out on tonight's <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/minnesota-timberwolves-new-york-knicks-2025110518/">Minnesota Timberwolves vs. New York Knicks</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/san-antonio-spurs-los-angeles-lakers-2025110513/">San Antonio Spurs vs. Los Angeles Lakers</a> games — both on ESPN — you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>One of the cheapest ways to watch ESPN is with a Sling Day Pass — for just $5/day, you can tune into any and all ESPN programming, including tonight's NBA games, with no other commitments. If you want a full switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all the Disney-owned channels. (Remember, unlike a lot of cable plans, you can easily <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-or-pause-your-youtube-tv-subscription-192023656.html">pause or cancel YouTube TV</a> or any of these alternatives, so long as you have month-to-month subscriptions.) If you're looking for a workaround to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, here's are the best options so you won't miss a moment of sports, news, or entertainment, all pulled from our list of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html">best live TV streaming services to cut cable</a>.&nbsp;</p>

(If you're just looking to catch one of this week's big games, like <em>Monday Night Football</em> on ESPN, it's a great short-term solution.) If you want a longer-term solution, you can get both ESPN and ABC with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge.&nbsp;</p>

Best Buy&#39;s early Black Friday sale has the comfy cans for 45 percent off, knocking their price down to $199. That matches <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-bose-quietcomfort-headphones-are-still-on-sale-for-199-on-the-last-day-of-prime-day-103010111.html">their record low from Prime Day</a>.</p> 
<p>Bose&#39;s headphones have top-notch comfort and active noise cancellation (ANC). For the latter, you can choose between &quot;Quiet&quot; (full ANC) and &quot;Aware&quot; (hear your surroundings) modes. There&#39;s also a wind-blocking feature. The headphones&#39; audio, while not quite on par with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review-impactful-upgrades-to-a-familiar-formula-150000709.html">the $449 Ultra variant</a> (and missing spatial tricks), far surpasses what you&#39;ll typically find for $199.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The company estimates 24 hours of battery life. It also supports quick charging: Plug in its USB-C cable and get up to 2.5 hours of charge in only 15 minutes.</p> 
<p>This model doesn&#39;t include an option to turn off ANC altogether, which some people may have appreciated. (That would have led to even more battery life, desirable for frequent travelers.) But if you&#39;re like me and always listen in ANC or aware modes, this is as solid a pick as you&#39;ll find for the sale price.</p>

In the US, the company has begun rolling out an update for Chrome on Android and iOS that adds an AI Mode shortcut to the browser&#39;s new tab page. It&#39;s predominantly featured, appearing right below the browser&#39;s signature search bar.</p>
<p>&quot;This will let you ask more complex, multi-part questions, and then dive even deeper into a topic with follow-up questions and relevant links,&quot; the company said of the update. In the near future, Google plans to bring the shortcut to 160 additional countries, with support for other languages — including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese — on the way as well.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bang &amp; Olufsen just announced a new luxury speaker that costs a pretty penny. The Beosound Premiere is a soundbar made from aluminum that&#39;s priced at $5,800.</p>
<p>It&#39;s visually striking, with the company referring to the soundbar as a &quot;piece of art.&quot; The aluminum chassis looks to be seamless, with a gorgeous matte satin finish. The up-firing tweeter has been placed directly in the center to draw the eye and there are plenty of lights placed throughout. There are lots of little details here, including 1,925 bespoke perforations to pay tribute to the company&#39;s founding year.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This is not merely a product; it is a curated experience,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Beosound Premiere redefines the category.&quot;</p>
<div id="602ceed1947045539edd8a6690d20f13"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWRyizoe3sk?si=gYF5QVQosNVCzNMS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>As for sound, there are ten custom-engineered drivers that assist with spatial audio by firing upwards. This allows &quot;sound to unfold around the listener from all angles&quot; and &quot;enhances clarity in dialogue and delivers deep, powerful bass.&quot; It integrates with Dolby Atmos 7.1.4 and can be paired with additional Bang &amp; Olufsen speakers via the company&#39;s proprietary Beolink Surround technology.</p>
<p>The soundbar also features a new patent-pending technology called Wide Stage. This uses a custom-designed algorithm to create the illusion of having additional speakers, making the &quot;soundstage wider and taller than it is.&quot; All of this stuff combines for an immersive listening experience.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also some kind of special integration with LG OLED C and G series TVs, but the company didn&#39;t get into what that entails. We reached out to Bang &amp; Olufsen for clarification. It&#39;s worth noting that the soundbar can work with any TV or audio source.</p>

<p>The Beosound Premiere is available in a trio of colorways, with the natural aluminum model releasing first in December. The gold one comes out in February, followed by a black soundbar in March. All models ship with a stand that enables both wall-mounting and tabletop placement. Again, the Premiere costs $5,800.</p>
<p>That high-end sticker price has become a hallmark of Bang &amp; Olufsen.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it was <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-playstation-portal-remote-player-is-a-200-handheld-just-for-ps5-game-streaming-140704336.html">first announced</a>, the PlayStation Portal was sort of a joke. The Nintendo Switch was a megahit, and many PlayStation fans had long hoped Sony would respond with a new handheld of its own. It did… in the form of a $200 peripheral that can only stream games over the internet and required you to already own a PlayStation 5. Instead of a successor to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-vita-10th-anniversary-favorite-games-200013083.html">beloved</a> yet <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vita-sony-editorial-rip-140000761.html">famously neglected</a> PlayStation Vita, we got the PlayStation version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-26-the-wii-u-revisited-looking-back-on-a-forward-thinking-console.html">Wii U GamePad</a>.</p> 
<p>My colleague Devindra Hardawar called it “baffling” in our <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-portal-review-a-baffling-handheld-for-no-one-but-sony-diehards-201558485.html">PlayStation Portal review</a>, and many of his criticisms still stand two years later. I was happy to ignore the Portal as a result. Besides, I already owned a bunch of devices that covered every way I wanted to play. The PS5 and PC were for the “pretty” games I want to sit and revel in on my monitor, while the Switch and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">Steam Deck</a> were for playing away from my desk. This combination worked for me.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Then, a few months ago, my wife and I had our first child. She is wonderful, and we are happy. But life pre-kids is often incongruous with life post-kids. My old routines and any pretense of personal time are gone. And while this might be the single least important aspect of my life that’s changed since becoming a father, the whiplash of going from “mid-30s man who spends too much time thinking about video games” to “mid-30s man who <em>wants</em> to enjoy his hobby but is now responsible for raising a kid” has completely turned me around on the Portal, which my wife gifted to me a few months prior to our baby’s birth.</p> 
<p>To be clear, I’m not here jonesing to play games all day instead of bonding with my daughter. But every parent needs a break sometimes, and whatever “free” time I get these days is inherently staggered. It’s not just the usual changing, feeding, tummy-time monitoring and diaper pail maintenance; it’s the 20-30 minutes of prep and clean-up that often comes with each of those. Topping up the formula dispenser here, running out for more wipes and baby laundry detergent there. Spending 10 minutes pedaling her legs so she can get a fart out.</p>

<p>All of this has been much more fun than it sounds, but for gaming purposes, it means I’ve almost exclusively switched to things I can play in short bursts. It’s been a lot of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html"><em>Balatro</em></a>, a lot of clearly timed multiplayer games like <em>Rocket League</em>, plus some slower, single-player games that let you save and quit at any time. These kinds of games have always been best suited to handhelds, and are thus the ones the Portal has helped me enjoy again when we get the baby to bed.</p> 
<p>Yes, I could just use the Switch or Steam Deck. But I dropped $500 on this damn PS5 back in 2020. I have more games in my PlayStation library than any other platform. I want to (slowly) make my way through exclusives like <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. I don’t want my fancy console to collect dust, and as silly as it sounds, finding the energy to sit at my desk and give my full attention to a game is difficult after a day of work and parenting. Most nights I’d prefer to unspool on the couch with my wife, and I need to be nearby to lend a hand or change a diaper. The Portal has allowed me to do this, and it’s kept my PlayStation from turning into a funky-looking paperweight in the process.</p> 
<p>The Portal fills this niche mostly by just being a handheld device, but it has its own benefits. The controls are fantastic, essentially splitting a normal PS5 controller in half. They give everything an “official” feel that you just can’t replicate with a smartphone controller <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/backbone-pro-hands-on-a-pricey-controller-for-more-than-just-your-phone-130034399.html">like a Backbone</a>. I wish the 8-inch display had a more color-rich OLED panel, but it’s still good for an LCD, roomier than my phone’s screen and sharp enough at 1080p. I’m a <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-ergofit-earbuds-irl-153513919.html">wired headphone guy</a>, so I can live with its lack of Bluetooth audio, as asinine as that is. And while I’m no longer paying $160 per year for PlayStation Plus Premium, those that do <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-stream-ps5-games-you-own-over-the-cloud-on-the-playstation-portal-135025829.html">can now stream</a> certain games <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-cloud-streaming-makes-the-playstation-portal-far-more-useful-171038751.html">directly from the cloud</a> without having to boot up their console. That worked fine in the short time I tried it.</p>

<p>My experience with the Portal is entirely predicated on the fact that I live in a modest apartment with decent Wi-Fi. It’s still a streaming device, so there’ve been some hiccups here and there. Using it for shooters or fighting games<em>&nbsp;</em>is just asking for frustration, and things start to destabilize if we have several streams going in the house at once. But under normal conditions, I’ve been able to play competitive multiplayer games like <em>Rematch </em>without ruinous lag, and I just haven’t had the crushing connection issues some folks have suffered through with single-player fare. As long as I keep the PS5 in rest mode, everything turns on and eventually works as it should.</p> 
<p>It’s a weird one: I still wouldn’t recommend the Portal to most PS5 owners, nor would I change all that much about our initial review. Of course, receiving it as a gift skews my perspective. Yet it’s made it easier to fit some games into my new life all the same. Looking after an infant has been one of my greatest joys, but it’s undeniably exhausting. With the Portal, I can still enjoy a platform I’ve heavily invested in — provided I don’t pass out first.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-playstation-portal-is-still-flawed-but-ive-learned-to-love-it-as-a-new-dad-120000850.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-the-best-early-tech-deals-on-apple-shark-lego-and-other-gear-ahead-of-the-biggest-sale-of-the-year-100052620.html?src=rss]]></description>

You’ll have to link your Nintendo Network ID to your Nintendo Account to see your Wii U and 3DS data, but play activity on those systems after February 2020 isn’t factored in.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-official-nintendo-store-app-hits-ios-and-android-151733629.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/proton-vpn-black-friday-deal-two-year-plans-are-75-percent-off-right-now-153737976.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the American market <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html" data-i13n="slk:still struggling;cpos:1;pos:1">still struggling</a> to get its head around the whole electric car thing, plenty of manufacturers are scaling back their EV ambitions to refocus on hybrid power. Whether that&#39;s right for the market and, indeed, the globe remains to be seen, but we can for sure expect to see a lot more cars with internal combustion over the next few years.</p><p>Honda has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-none-are-us-bound-150000629.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">made its plans clear</a> on that front, which might be cause for concern among many for one simple reason: Outside of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-23-2019-acura-nsx-review.html" data-i13n="slk:NSX;cpos:3;pos:1">NSX</a>, the company&#39;s hybrids thus far haven&#39;t exactly been the most engaging of machines. That, though, could change with a new set of hybrid platforms launching soon that&#39;ll be lighter, quicker and even more fun to drive.</p><p>At the company&#39;s extensive proving grounds outside of Tochigi, Japan, I was given a go in a pair of cars that gave me reason to be optimistic about this next generation of electrically assisted but still combustion-dependent machines. They rely on a series of advancements that come together to form three different platforms: Small, Medium and Large.</p><p>Collectively, they&#39;re known as the Next Generation Hybrid System, and each one is designed to be modular, able to be scaled up or down to fit different models while still keeping their fundamental sections the same. Platform sharing like this makes it much easier (and cheaper) for manufacturers to roll out new machines and to do it quickly. With Honda looking to ramp up its hybrid offerings, that&#39;s key.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%285%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%285%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The the engine for Honda&#39;s &quot;Large&quot; next-gen hybrid system " data-uuid="69c6a27e-c77e-41ef-a10b-3e34554267f8"><figcaption>The the engine for Honda&#39;s &quot;Large&quot; next-gen hybrid system </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>These platforms encompass things like chassis, engines, electric motors and electronics, plus the wonderful web of software required to tie it all together. Reducing weight is a huge focus here, with Honda&#39;s engineers coming up with a way to maintain crash safety while dramatically reducing the size of the front and rear subframes. This alone equates to a weight savings of some 90 kilograms (about 200 pounds) in a vehicle the size of a Honda Civic.&nbsp;</p><p>Lighter weight means more efficiency and better fuel economy. There&#39;s also a commensurate reduction in cost of 10 percent for manufacturing versus the company&#39;s current platforms, plus promises of increased grip and reduced road noise.&nbsp;</p><p>The smallest of Honda&#39;s new platforms is destined for Honda&#39;s smallest cars, including ultra-minis that swarm Japanese streets but have rarely found much success in the United States. For now, at least, we won&#39;t be getting any cars based on that platform.</p><p>The Medium and Large platforms, though, will be tucked in neatly throughout many next-generation cars from the brand. Medium will be suitable for four-cylinder machines like the Civic and crossover SUVs like the HR-V. The Large platform, meanwhile, will be used for bigger V6 machines, like the Ridgeline and Passport.</p><p>Each system ties that engine to a pair of electric motors, plus an optional third electric motor at the back for all-wheel drive. A revised, more compact battery provides the high-voltage current to power the system. It&#39;s tucked in beneath the rear seat.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%2811%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Honda_Next-Gen_Hybrid_first_drive_%2811%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="A next-gen prototype on track at Honda&#39;s facility near Tochigi, Japan" data-uuid="bd216f5d-3ebe-45fb-b671-05b55ad2906f"><figcaption>A next-gen prototype on track at Honda&#39;s facility near Tochigi, Japan</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>None of that is radically different from what can be found in Honda&#39;s current hybrids. And, like those, these new hybrids will be able to run in an effective series hybrid mode, where the engine just charges the battery and the car drives exclusively using the electric motors. Or, step on that throttle harder at higher speeds and the car can directly engage the engine to power the car forward.</p><p>That&#39;s all familiar, but a few changes could have some significant impacts. On the Large platform, a new transmission enables the car to have both a &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;lo&quot; gear range, which could be a boon for anyone towing their trusty trailer up into the mountains for a weekend getaway.&nbsp;</p><p>The Medium-sized platform can do some shifting, too, but it&#39;s only pretend shifting here using a system called S+ Shift. At the press of a button (conveniently labeled S+), this new technology creates the experience of driving a virtual eight-speed transmission that you can run up or down through by pulling on the shift paddles on the back of the steering wheel.</p><p>Since, again, these hybrids are driven by their electric motors, shifting isn&#39;t really doing much of anything but making the engine rev more or less. But, by varying the electric motor&#39;s output and regeneration, you get a surge of extra resistance on deceleration and a kick of acceleration on upshifts, all to simulate the feeling of a proper transmission.</p><p>I confess that I was very skeptical about how this system would really help when I went to Japan, but I was wrong. It&#39;s great. Honda prepared a prototype sedan for me to drive, and it looked all the world like a current-gen Civic up top, except with a rather large nose stuck on the front and some decidedly pronounced flared fenders.&nbsp;</p><p>Underneath the skin was a completely different machine, built around a front-drive version of the next-gen platform. It sounded great to start, helped by what looked like a sport exhaust at the back, plus no shortage of digital augmentation coming through the speakers.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Prelude_first_drive_012.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Prelude_first_drive_012.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The S+ button on Honda&#39;s upcoming Prelude hybrid" data-uuid="89fe89b3-ac75-49f1-92e6-6ace117df1ac"><figcaption>The S+ button on Honda&#39;s upcoming Prelude hybrid</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>But the S+ Shift mode really made a compelling difference, too. Even though you&#39;re really just needlessly revving that hybrid engine more or less, and actually making the system less efficient, the result is a car that feels responsive and in control, rather than something just droning on as deftly as possible.The way the car responds, aggressively downshifting as you brake for corners and giving you a little kick with every upshift on the way out, it made me smile.</p><p>The rest of the car did, too. Honda&#39;s test track was far too smooth for me to sample the improved ride quality or reduction in road noise, but the car&#39;s handling felt good and its steering sharp, not quite as remarkable as the current Civic Type R but, again, way more fun than today&#39;s humble Civic Hybrid.&nbsp;</p><p>Honda hasn&#39;t announced where this new platform will first appear, but if you want to get an early taste of S+ Shift, it&#39;ll be debuting in the upcoming Honda Prelude hybrid. That reborn coupe lacks all the other advancements to be found in Honda&#39;s next-gen platform, but it does offer the S+ virtual shifting. It&#39;s remarkably effective here, too, and with lots of parts sharing with the Civic Type R, the Prelude was a surprisingly good time.</p><p>While the Prelude is hitting dealers soon, to sample cars featuring the next-gen hybrid platform, you&#39;ll have to wait a little longer. Honda representatives said it&#39;ll start showing up beneath the flesh of its machines starting as soon as next year. Based on the shape of that prototype I drove, I&#39;d say a next-generation Civic will be among the first to sport it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/driving-hondas-lighter-faster-and-more-fun-next-gen-hybrid-prototype-150000472.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every two years, the Japan Mobility Show gives us a preview of the future of motoring as envisioned by the major Japanese manufacturers. Sadly, for Honda, the resounding message coming from this year&#39;s show was that the future is getting a little farther away. That&#39;s the case for American drivers, at least, thanks largely to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-is-bad-for-american-evs-but-it-could-have-been-worse-210155196.html" data-i13n="slk:the effects of the Trump administration;cpos:1;pos:1">the effects of the Trump administration</a> according to Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe.&nbsp;</p><p>In Tokyo this year, the company unveiled a trio of cool, next-gen electric vehicles at the show, each more compelling than the next. First up is the new 0 Series α, a new addition to the 0 Series of EVs that Honda has been teasing us with for a few years now.</p><p>Back in January at&nbsp; CES, the company showed off the evocatively styled <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-closer-look-at-the-slick-honda-0-suv-and-saloon-prototypes-at-ces-2025-134550129.html" data-i13n="slk:0 Saloon and 0 SUV;cpos:2;pos:1">0 Saloon and 0 SUV</a>. Both made quite a stir, particularly the former, which was impossible to admire without picking up strong Lamborghini vibes. Mibe confirmed that those cars are still on track, coming towards the end of 2026 or 2027. However, expected sales have been reduced.&nbsp;</p><p>Mibe didn&#39;t give specifics there, only saying: &quot;The volume initially will probably be less than we had envisioned earlier.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_0_series_alpha_%282%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_0_series_alpha_%282%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Honda 0 Series &#x0003b1; EV looks similar to the SUV prototype from CES 2025" data-uuid="29a734ec-08a2-46a3-9b35-20df88a6f060"><figcaption>Honda 0 Series α EV looks similar to the SUV prototype from CES 2025</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honda</div></figure><p>The newly unveiled 0 Series α is a new, third member of Honda&#39;s nascent next-gen EV family. It looks nigh identical to the SUV concept, but in reality, it&#39;s significantly smaller. It will be cheaper, too, enabling it to target the Indian market. It has a hope of going elsewhere in the world, including Japan and Europe, but Honda representatives said repeatedly that it&#39;s not for the American market. Mibe said it&#39;s &quot;probably too small&quot; for the US market.</p><p>So, too, the Super-One Prototype. This tiny hatchback made a run up the hill at the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this year, wrapped in camouflage to hide its decidedly angular profile. In Tokyo, Honda stripped off the graphics, revealing a cheeky mini-sized machine with big box fenders and endless personality. While Honda didn&#39;t quote a power output, it surely won’t be a rocket ship, but with the instant torque of an EV, plus a variety of selectable synthesized engine notes, it should still be a mighty good time.</p><p>Indeed, it was. I got a brief go behind the wheel of a prototype machine at Honda&#39;s proving grounds in Tochigi, Japan. Though it wasn&#39;t much for outright speed, the brisk acceleration combined with petite dimensions made me grin ear-to-ear. Sadly, though, that&#39;s probably the only chance I&#39;ll ever get to drive one. The Super-One is intended for drivers in Japan and the United Kingdom, with potential expansion elsewhere in Europe based on demand.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%284%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%284%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Driving the Honda Super-One on a test track near Tochigi, Japan" data-uuid="c39ec131-a19c-478a-877e-163b6c319540"><figcaption>Driving the Honda Super-One on a test track near Tochigi, Japan</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>America has never been a great market for machines of that size, so it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that these two aren&#39;t US-bound, but it is part of a more troubling trend. Honda has largely paused its efforts to develop low-cost EVs for the American market, waiting for political headwinds to come around.</p><p>&quot;With the Trump administration in place, we have a sense that maybe the EV growth has been moved back out by maybe five years or so into the future. So, the timing for doing anything will be difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;2030, at that point in time, maybe we need to provide a wide, broad product range, including EVs. So, we will have to think about future strategy for the US market.&quot;</p><p>Tellingly, Mibe said that they&#39;re actively watching American mid-term elections, to see whether there&#39;s any hope of the political climate changing in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like in discount furniture stores, volume is the real factor here, particularly when it comes to battery production. The company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-honda-gm-ev.html" data-i13n="slk:partnership with General Motors;cpos:3;pos:1">partnership with General Motors</a> was an attempt to do just that.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%281%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Honda_Super-One_First_Drive_%281%29.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Honda&#39;s Super-One prototype isn&#39;t much for speed, but that&#39;s okay" data-uuid="f9071d66-9466-4ab5-9bea-1d8d6de20818"><figcaption>Honda&#39;s Super-One prototype isn&#39;t much for speed, but that&#39;s okay</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;Our first objective in collaborating with GM was to expand the volume to reduce the cost,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe the aim there, from on the side of GM, was the same.&quot;</p><p>That partnership, however, was aborted after just the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-prologue-electric-suv-184544002.html" data-i13n="slk:Honda Prologue;cpos:4;pos:1">Honda Prologue</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/acuras-zdx-ev-has-an-estimated-325-miles-of-range-and-starts-at-around-60000-160023372.html" data-i13n="slk:Acura ZDX;cpos:5;pos:1">Acura ZDX</a> reached the market, leaving Honda to go its own way for now, at least, bereft of a partner to boost its battery volume.&nbsp;</p><p>This could complicate Honda&#39;s plans to be totally carbon neutral by 2050, a pledge that Mibe said is still very much in the cards. To start in that direction, the company will push more towards advanced hybrids of the sort we&#39;ll get our first taste of starting next year. (I also got to sample that while I was out there, which you can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/driving-hondas-lighter-faster-and-more-fun-next-gen-hybrid-prototype-150000472.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">read about here</a>.)</p><p>However, while these new hybrids will decrease consumption and further reduce the carbon footprint of a given car, they will not completely eliminate it. So, Honda is working on other means of decreasing the company&#39;s effective carbon footprint, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/can-our-climate-be-saved-by-vacuuming-carbon-out-of-the-skies-145944818.html" data-i13n="slk:direct air capture (DAC);cpos:7;pos:1">direct air capture (DAC)</a>, devices which can suck carbon dioxide straight out of the air — a long-time environmental dream that&#39;s always seemed just a few years away.</p><p>So small, cheap EVs aren&#39;t in the plans for the immediate future, but Honda isn&#39;t totally giving up on its US EV aspirations. Again, the 0 Series SUV and Saloon are due next year. Mibe said there&#39;s another, even larger EV due for the American market sometime after 2030, but that too could depend on which way the American government swings between now and then.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EV_Outlire_Concept_04_ON_v04.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EV_Outlire_Concept_04_ON_v04.jpg" style="height:1911px;width:2560px;" alt="Honda&#39;s EV Outlier is an electric motorcycle concept with sci-fi looks" data-uuid="3f6d943d-02cf-4cb1-b713-4c12da1e0f12"><figcaption>Honda&#39;s EV Outlier is an electric motorcycle concept with sci-fi looks</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honda</div></figure><p>If all&#39;s looking well, we might eventually get a taste of another electric concept that Honda rolled out at the show. Called the EV Outlier, it&#39;s an electric motorcycle with a lean, sharp style and a laid-back riding position that is hard not to read as at least partially inspired by that most iconic sci-fi motorcycle of all time: Kaneda&#39;s bike in Akira.</p><p>This one isn&#39;t red and it lacks the distinctive stickers, but like Kaneda&#39;s bike, both wheels are driven by electricity. It relies on a pair of integrated hub motors to provide the thrust, and if the width of the rear tire is any indication, there&#39;ll be plenty of that.</p><p>A sweeping, free-standing digital display serves as the dashboard, and controls are minimalist in a way that only a concept bike can be. Honda said this might be ready for production by 2030, but the svelte packaging here may necessitate next-generation, solid-state batteries to make that a reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Those batteries, Mibe said, are still progressing. Honda has a prototype production line in process, so they&#39;re actually building the things and trying to turn them into viable products.</p><p>But that&#39;s only if Honda can overcome some significant engineering challenges between now and then, and if the US government dials back on the EV hate by the end of the decade. Those are two pretty big ifs, and I confess I&#39;m not sure which poses the biggest challenge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-its-us-plans-are-getting-more-tepid-150000775.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slowly but surely, Sony has been transforming the initially limited <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-portal-review-a-baffling-handheld-for-no-one-but-sony-diehards-201558485.html">PlayStation Portal</a> into a viable handheld for PS5 gamers, albeit only those with a solid internet connection. What launched as a strictly remote play device eventually got <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-cloud-streaming-makes-the-playstation-portal-far-more-useful-171038751.html">unlocked</a> for cloud streaming, with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/stray-leads-novembers-lineup-of-ps-plus-games-180339318.html">PS Plus</a> Premium members able to play select Game Catalog games without needing to connect to a PS5. And from 6am PT <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">today</a>, you can also stream select digital PS5 games that you own on the Portal.</p>
<p>Again, you’ll need to have a PS Plus Premium membership to take advantage of the new features, but once signed up to the most expensive tier of Sony’s subscription service you’ll be able to stream the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/astro-bot-ps5-review-one-of-the-best-games-sony-has-ever-made-120014494.html"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-a-whole-new-world-140018063.html"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which are among the the thousands of games <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">supported</a> at launch. Naturally some of the games in your library will probably be on PS Plus as cloud-streamable games already, but newer first-party games like several of those mentioned above aren&#39;t.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2dbab47d654d4324a631e67cc8e02a14"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPgBMPkWXeg?si=rliSDs4xfuAMLs8-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>You could, of course, already also play all of these games on the Portal over remote play from your PS5. But now that the device has been untethered from the main console, it gets a little bit closer to the dedicated go-anywhere PlayStation handheld everyone wants. That&#39;s provided you have a decent enough Wi-Fi connection to get a good quality stream.</p>
<p>Alongside the new cloud streaming functionality, the Portal has a new home screen that adds a search tab for quickly finding games that are available to stream. The latest update also adds 3D audio support for supported games on both remote play and cloud streams when using wired headphones or one of Sony’s proprietary PlayStation Link headsets. You can also now add a passcode lock to the device, while a new network status screen is available in the Quick menu.</p>
<p>Sony now allows you to make in-game purchases while streaming games over the cloud without leaving a session, and if you have a friend playing the same game you’re streaming, you can receive invites and join their game from the Quick menu.</p>
<p>Sony seems intent on the PlayStation Portal plugging the gap between now and the PS6, which could <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/leak-claims-the-ps6-could-have-triple-the-performance-as-the-ps5-for-the-same-price-203801615.html">reportedly</a> arrive in the next two years alongside a powerful complementary handheld device that might beat out the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> in the specs department. A next-generation native PlayStation handheld remains the dream, but in the meantime, the Portal is a lot more appealing than it was a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-stream-ps5-games-you-own-over-the-cloud-on-the-playstation-portal-135025829.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-the-official-replacement-for-google-assistant-on-smart-devices-130041482.html">replacing Assistant</a> with Gemini across all its apps, and Maps is the latest one getting an upgrade. The AI assistant will let you interact with the app using natural conversation while you navigate the roads hands-free. You can, for instance, ask it: &quot;Is there a budget-friendly Japanese restaurant along my route within a couple of miles?&quot; And after it has responded, you can keep on asking it follow-up questions, such as if a specific restaurant has a parking space and what dishes are popular there. Once you&#39;ve decided on a place, you can simply tell Gemini: &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go there,&quot; to start navigating to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also be able to ask Gemini to do random tasks while it&#39;s navigating and without leaving the Maps app, such as adding events to your Calendar if you allow it to connect to the app. In addition, Gemini will let you report traffic disruptions, simply by saying &quot;there&#39;s flooding ahead&quot; or &quot;I see an accident.&quot; Gemini in Google Maps is rolling out over the next few weeks to Android and iOS in all regions where Gemini is available. It&#39;s also coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html">Android Auto in the future</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the US, Maps is getting more capabilities powered by the AI assistant. You can now get directions that mention landmarks that are easy to spot. Instead of saying &quot;turn left in 500 feet,&quot; for example, Gemini will say &quot;turn left after the Thai Siam Restaurant.&quot; The landmark will also be highlighted in Maps as a visual cue. This feature is now rolling out to both Android and iOS devices. Maps will now proactively notify you of road disruptions on Android, as well, even if you&#39;re not actively navigating. Finally, you&#39;ll be able to use Lens with Gemini within the Maps app when it starts rolling out later this month to Android and iOS. You simply have to tap on the camera in the Maps search bar, point to an establishment and ask it questions about the location, such as &quot;What is this place and why is it popular?&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-maps-gemini-integration-will-make-hands-free-navigation-more-conversational-140009629.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This particular model easily made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

<p>We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark.</p> 
<p>The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn&#39;t just for Nintendo&#39;s latest console. It&#39;ll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.

We already knew that the streamer will <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/some-spotify-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-180000074.html"><ins>start licensing</ins></a> video podcasts from Spotify Studios and <em>The Ringer</em> in the new year, and according to a new report, agents at leading talent agencies are being sounded out ahead of a Q1 push.</p>
<p>Sources have told <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-video-podcasts-1236417771/"><em><ins>The Hollywood Reporter</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that Netflix has sent “dozens of requests&quot; to agents at WME, UTA and CAA as it looks to add more video podcasts to the platform. The plan is that the company launches its video podcast offering in early 2026, by which time it wants to have a library of shows with existing audiences.</p>

According to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s sources, Netflix wants an exclusivity deal that would mean featured shows would no longer be uploaded to YouTube. The latter is Spotify’s biggest rival in the space, and passed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube-passes-1-billion-monthly-active-podcast-viewers-225223309.html"><ins>one billion</ins></a> monthly active podcast viewers at the start of 2025.</p>
<p>The Spotify deal Netflix penned last month includes nine sports podcasts at launch, among them <em>The Bill Simmons Podcast </em>and <em>The Zach Lowe Show</em>.

<p>It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter.</p> 
<p>The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Putting AI in space may sound like a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/Skynet">sci-fi nightmare</a>, but Google is thinking about the idea with a research endeavor called <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/">Project Suncatcher</a>. The idea is to put power-hungry data centers into orbit on solar-powered satellites, so they can be powered by unlimited, clean energy available 24 hours a day. That would mitigate the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html">nastiest</a> aspects of AI cloud computing, like the use of power plants that spew huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Suncatcher is a literal moonshot of the type that Google <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-is-cutting-dozens-of-jobs-at-its-x-moonshot-lab-203505073.html">used to do</a> more often. The search giant wants to put its AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), into orbit aboard solar panel-equipped satellites. “In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute,” wrote Google senior director Travis Beals. &quot;In the right orbit, a solar panel can be up to 8 times more productive than on Earth, and produce power nearly continuously, reducing the need for batteries.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Suffice to say, the idea poses numerous challenges. That proximity to the sun would expose the TPUs to high levels of radiation that can rapidly degrade electronic components. However, Google has tested its current chips for radiation tolerance and said they&#39;d be able to survive a five year mission without suffering permanent failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/a7415850-ba21-11f0-bffe-309490ec2bf4" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/a7415850-ba21-11f0-bffe-309490ec2bf4" style="height:1182px;width:2096px;" alt="Google Tensor Processing Unit" data-uuid="2280e6b2-f009-3d30-870d-787128b8612f"><figcaption>Google&#39;s Tensor Processing Unit</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>Another challenge is the high-speed data links of &quot;tens of terabits per second&quot; and low latency required between satellites. Those speeds would be hard to achieve in space, as transmitting data at long distances requires exponentially more power than on Earth. To achieve that, Google said it may need to maneuver TPU-equipped satellites into tight formations, possibly within &quot;kilometers or less&quot; of each other. That would have the added benefit of reducing &quot;station keeping&quot; thrust maneuvers needed to keep the satellites in the right position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The determining factor, though, is money. Launching TPUs into space may not seem cost-efficient, but Google&#39;s analysis shows that doing so could be &quot;roughly comparable&quot; to data centers on Earth (in terms of power efficiency) by around the mid-2030s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it&#39;s currently only a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/suncatcher_paper.pdf">preliminary research paper</a>, Google is planning to put Project Suncatcher through some initial trials. It has teamed with a company called <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.planet.com/">Planet</a> on a &quot;learning mission&quot; to launch a pair of prototype satellites into orbit by 2027. &quot;This experiment will test how our models and TPU hardware operate in space and validate the use of optical inter-satellite links for distributed ML [machine learning] tasks,&quot; Google wrote.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After launching it in China earlier, DJI has unveiled its flagship smartphone gimbal, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:DJI;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DJI&amp;linkText=Osmo+Mobile+8&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kamkuY29tL29zbW8tbW9iaWxlLTgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjliNjI2YjMyLWY1NmMtNDIxNC1iODgyLThkNWY5ZDEzMDA0MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGppLmNvbS9vc21vLW1vYmlsZS04In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQ2codZo2pbWsy5AQ_akQRKSJHJAYbLFARAa0YEx4mwE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fosmo-mobile-8" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.dji.com/osmo-mobile-8">Osmo Mobile 8</a> in the US and elsewhere. The new model looks much like the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-mobile-7p-gimbal-can-track-you-around-on-any-android-or-ios-camera-app-130037243.html">Osmo Mobile 7P</a> and has the same Multifunctional tracking module with a built-in light. However, it adds a bunch of useful new functionality including Apple DockKit support, 360-degree panning and pet tracking.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The lack of Apple DockKit support was an issue with the Osmo Mobile 7P, as it made tracking yourself trickier with some apps. It also put DJI behind <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360s-flow-pro-2-gimbal-offers-a-sturdier-build-and-a-selfie-mirror-130016865.html">Insta360&#39;s Flow 2 Pro</a>, which does support DockKit. That&#39;s no longer an issue with the Osmo Mobile 8, though. You can now do subject tracking within the native iPhone camera app or any of the 200-plus iOS applications compatible with DockKit.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>At the same time, full tracking is available via the Multifunctional Module. That attaches to the side of its updated, more secure magnetic phone mount, letting you track yourself or other subjects automatically with any camera app. It includes a surprisingly powerful LED fill light and works as a receiver for DJI&#39;s wireless microphones, including the Mic Mini, Mic 2 and Mic 3. On top of humans, the module now supports dog and cat tracking as well. As before, it also supports gesture control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another key feature is a pan axis that supports 360 degree horizontal rotation that no longer hits a stop as before. That means when you lock onto moving subjects with intelligent tracking, it&#39;ll keep following them even if they go all the way around the camera. The updated, more comfortable grip (and 0.8 pound weight) also makes it easier to take low angle shots, something that that will be handy when trying to follow your cat around.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When using DJI&#39;s Mimo app, you also get access to DJI&#39;s advanced ActiveTrack 7.0.1 tracking tech. It comes with a feature called Dual Lens Boost 2 that uses your phones wide-angle and telephoto lenses to make sure a subject isn&#39;t lost, even if they move quickly or within a crowded scene. Another feature, Smart Capture, makes it easy to switch between subjects, even in complex environments, according to DJI.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The OM8 uses DJI&#39;s latest three-axis stabilization tech to smooth even jarring movements without hurting quality like a smartphone can do. Other features include an integrated tripod, easy switching between front and rear cameras (along with the ability to flip the camera 180 degrees for rear camera selfies), an integrated tripod and a built-in extension rod.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DJI&#39;s Osmo Mobile 8 gimbal is now available in Europe for 159 euros, but won&#39;t be sold on DJI&#39;s US site due to what DJI calls &quot;evolving market conditions.&quot; However, it&#39;s now available on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FJ2L67HJ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAZiQqzZtEtqvrd64kFerxUt2SLhGlyQuhyUw3HWrd_-5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDJI-6937224126817-Osmo-Mobile%2Fdp%2FB0FJ2L67HJ%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-6937224126817-Osmo-Mobile/dp/B0FJ2L67HJ/ref=sr_1_1">Amazon</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;linkText=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xOTE3NjgzLVJFRy9kamlfY3Bfb3NfMDAwMDA0OTJfMDNfb3Ntb19tb2JpbGVfOC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YjYyNmIzMi1mNTZjLTQyMTQtYjg4Mi04ZDVmOWQxMzAwNDEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJocGhvdG92aWRlby5jb20vYy9wcm9kdWN0LzE5MTc2ODMtUkVHL2RqaV9jcF9vc18wMDAwMDQ5Ml8wM19vc21vX21vYmlsZV84Lmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZm33-mPAUfT6S2QY7N6XmBBNnvP6AKXDhe9zbmSI6Qn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1917683-REG%2Fdji_cp_os_00000492_03_osmo_mobile_8.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1917683-REG/dji_cp_os_00000492_03_osmo_mobile_8.html">B&amp;H Photo Video</a> and other third-party stores for $149.&nbsp;</p>

The best budget models strike a great balance between price and performance, giving you smooth everyday use without cutting too many corners. Whether you’re scrolling social media, streaming your favorite shows or snapping photos of a night out, there’s an affordable Android phone that can handle it all.<br><br>Cheaper phones have come a long way in recent years. Many now feature bright, fast displays, reliable cameras and battery life that lasts well into the next day. You might miss out on top-tier extras like the latest processor or ultra-high-resolution zoom, but what you get instead is value that makes sense. Some models even surprise with cameras that rival far pricier flagships, making them ideal for casual photographers or anyone who just wants to capture a great shot on the go.<br><br>We’ve tested budget Android phones from brands like Google, Samsung and OnePlus to find the ones that deliver the most for less. These are the models that prove you don’t need a flagship price tag to get a dependable Android phone.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-cheap-should-you-go-for-an-android-phone">How cheap should you go for an Android phone?</h2> 
<p>We tend to define a budget smartphone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises in function, and above that, you cross over to pricier <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html">midrange handsets</a> (if you&#39;re open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorite flagship phones at the very end of this guide).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies, WiFi browsing or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 Samsung phones and other Android devices have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better phone cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-android-phone">What to look for in a cheap Android phone</h2> 
<p>When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-price-difference-for-a-cheap-android-vs-a-cheap-iphone">What&#39;s the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone?</h3> 
<p>iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-magsafe-power-bank">What to consider before buying a MagSafe power bank</h2> 
<p><strong>Choose the right capacity</strong>. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time.</p> 
<p><strong>Understand MagSafe versus Qi2</strong>. All iPhones model 12 and later have MagSafe technology, which rely on embedded magnets to align the phone with a wireless charger and can support charging speeds of up to 15 watts. The MagSafe name is owned by Apple — third-party chargers can’t freely use the term and instead call their accessories “magnetic,” or apply a branded name like Anker’s MagGo or UGreen’s MagFlow. Be sure to check the product details before buying: anything that works with Apple’s technology will be listed as MagSafe-compatible.</p> 
<p>Qi2 is a standard from the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/about-us/">Wireless Power Consortium</a> (of which Apple is a member) and has the same stipulations as MagSafe (15W charging and magnetic alignment). Any company can submit their tech for this certification. iPhones 13 and later are Qi2 compatible.</p> 
<p>The newest standard, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qi2-25w-wireless-charging-is-coming-to-iphones-and-major-android-smartphones-183013979.html">Qi2 25W</a> (also called Qi2.2), bumps wireless charging speeds up to 25W. The WPC <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/">says</a> a certified smartphone using a certified charger can wirelessly go from dead to half full in about 30 minutes (keep in mind that both the charger <em>and</em> phone need to be certified to get those speeds) and that aligns with our testing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Accessories, like power banks that support the new standard are starting to hit shelves now. As for phones, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL, Apple’s iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max all support the standard as well. iPhone 16 models (except the 16e)<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/23/ios-26-adds-qi2-25w-support-to-iphone-16-series/#:~:text=iPhone%2017%20Pro-,iOS%2026%20Adds%2025W%20Qi2%20Wireless%20Charging%20Support%20to%20iPhone,to%20the%20iPhone%2016%20series."> support</a> the standard after an update to iOS 26.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember travel restrictions</strong>. You may have seen <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://news.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html">news reports</a> of flights being grounded because a power bank caught fire in the cabin. Currently, the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">TSA allows</a> them in your carry-on luggage as long as they’re rated at 100 watt-hours or lower (about 27,000mAh for lithium ion batteries).</p> 
<p>But some airlines have enacted further restrictions. <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/travel/southwest-airlines-tightens-rules-visible-portable-chargers">Southwest</a>, for example, requires you to keep power banks out of the bag and visible while charging. Even if your airline doesn’t make such demands, keeping a power brick out in the open while it’s in use is a good idea — it’ll keep it cooler and you’ll be more likely to notice if it starts to overheat. Most, if not all, MagSafe battery packs come in at under the 100-watt-hour limit, so traveling should be easy with one.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider the extra features</strong>. You may not need them, but the little extra perks of a MagSafe power bank can come in handy. Some have stands so you can watch your phone while it refills. Some have LED displays that tell you how much charge is left, which can be a little more precise than the lighted pips other banks use. Some also have straps to make the bank easier to carry around or fish out of your bag.</p>

It has the same minimalist look and pocketable thinness as Apple’s proprietary battery, but it’ll attach to other phones in addition to the Air. Plus it’s $35 cheaper.</p>

It makes excellent use of its 5K capacity, delivering a 90 percent refill to an iPhone 15. But it’s a little more expensive than the our top slim pick, Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim, and the squared off design makes it feel bulkier than it actually is. Neither of those make it a bad choice; the MagSafe battery playing field is just terribly competitive right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-magsafe-power-banks-faqs">MagSafe power banks FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-does-magsafe-do"><strong>What does MagSafe do?</strong></h3> 
<p>MagSafe is Apple’s own technology that supports up to 25W wireless charging speeds and incorporates embedded magnets to align the phone with chargers and other accessories.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-iphones-support-magsafe"><strong>Which iPhones support MagSafe?</strong></h3> 
<p>iPhones 12 and later support 15W MagSafe technology, though only iPhones 13 and later can reach the 15W charging speed with third-party Qi2 accessories. The iPhone 12 maxes out at 7.5W with non-Apple accessories.</p> 
<p>The new iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max support up to 25W charging speeds with Qi2 25W-certified chargers. iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max should also support those speeds after an update to iOS 26. The iPhone Air supports MagSafe charging at a max speed of 20W.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-use-magsafe-batteries-with-a-case"><strong>Can you use MagSafe batteries with a case?</strong></h3> 
<p>In most cases (heh), yes. The wireless charge can travel across a distance of a few millimeters. If the case is more than 5mm thick or contains metal components, the wireless charge can be blocked. Many iPhone cases are marketed as MagSafe-compatible, which means the case itself has complimentary magnets inside and should not interfere with charging accessories. We tested a MagSafe power bank on an iPhone 15 with and without a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Target;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=827d7835-78d6-4491-ae04-c042cab1d6e7&amp;itemId=impact_radius_2092-89182367&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8986e106-bf40-49ec-b584-64a9e8a0f01c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Target&amp;linkText=MagSafe+case&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXJnZXQuY29tL3AvYXBwbGUtaXBob25lLTE1LWlwaG9uZS0xNC1pcGhvbmUtMTMtc3F1YXJlLWNhc2Utd2l0aC1tYWdzYWZlLWhleWRheS04NDgyLW5lb24tcGluay8tL0EtODkxODIzNjciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg5ODZlMTA2LWJmNDAtNDllYy1iNTg0LTY0YTllOGEwZjAxYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFyZ2V0LmNvbS9wL2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xNS1pcGhvbmUtMTQtaXBob25lLTEzLXNxdWFyZS1jYXNlLXdpdGgtbWFnc2FmZS1oZXlkYXktODQ4Mi1uZW9uLXBpbmsvLS9BLTg5MTgyMzY3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUGgNj_ET-0ZFYIyAHqke8Ggxi354PCsqFupVdglJJWE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-iphone-15-iphone-14-iphone-13-square-case-with-magsafe-heyday-8482-neon-pink%2F-%2FA-89182367" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-15-iphone-14-iphone-13-square-case-with-magsafe-heyday-8482-neon-pink/-/A-89182367">MagSafe case</a> and got the same charging speeds and amounts in both tests.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-power-do-magsafe-batteries-provide"><strong>How much power do MagSafe batteries provide?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the power bank. If it is Qi2-certified, it can provide up to 15 watts of wireless power. Qi2 25W-enabled chargers can deliver up to 25 watts to a compatible handset. Non-Qi2 batteries typically deliver around 7.5 watts.</p> 
<p>The amount of charge delivered depends on the capacity. Most MagSafe portable chargers are rated at 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh. The former can get a standard iPhone 15 from five percent to around 90 percent. The latter can fill the phone completely with enough left over for another half charge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Motorola just announced the Edge 70 smartphone, which is an ultra-thin handset that could rival the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html"><ins>recently-launched Apple iPhone Air</ins></a>. It&#39;s a bit thicker than the Air, at 5.9mm compared to 5.6mm, but the camera bump is less noticeable.</p>
<p>As for that camera bump, the Edge 70 features a trio of 50MP camera sensors. The main camera can capture 4K video and there&#39;s also a front camera, an ultrawide with a macro lens and a dedicated light sensor. Like most modern smartphones, there are AI tools available for photo editing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The frame is made from &quot;aircraft-grade aluminum,&quot; which is a good thing because my uncoordinated fingers will absolutely be dropping this thing within three days of owning one. Other durability features include Corning Gorilla Glass 7i and IP69 water protection.</p>

<p>The phone will also have access to the company&#39;s proprietary moto ai2 chatbot. This can do all of the usual stuff like create images and answer queries. However, Motorola also boasts that the AI can understand what&#39;s on the screen and can point users to the correct course of action. We&#39;ll have to wait and see how that works in real life.</p>
<p>This skinny handset somehow includes a massive 4800mAh battery that allows up to 50 hours of continuous use. That&#39;s over two full days of doomscrolling without ever heading to the power outlet. As a comparison, the iPhone Air <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-air-is-apples-thinnest-phone-yet-174342422.html"><ins>lasts anywhere from</ins></a> 22 to 27 hours</p>
<p>The Edge 70 ships with a magnetic case that can handle wireless charging and includes a Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile chipset. Motorola promises active software support and security upgrades all the way until 2031.</p>
<p>Given the form factor and specs, the price is actually fairly reasonable. The Edge 70 starts at £700, which breaks down to around $910 USD. It&#39;s available for purchase right now, but there&#39;s a spot of bad news. It&#39;s launching in the UK and there&#39;s no current information as to when it&#39;ll cross the pond.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-motorola-edge-70-is-another-ridiculously-thin-smartphone-080009244.html?src=rss]]></description>
