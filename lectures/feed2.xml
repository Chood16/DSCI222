                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>South Korean games publisher Krafton recently announced its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving"><ins>transformation into an &quot;AI first&quot; company</ins></a>, which typically means that human jobs are about to go on the chopping block. To that end, the company is now trying to slash its workforce by offering voluntary resignations, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Krafton is a giant company with tentacles in numerous development studios, including the folks that make <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Subnautica</em>. The organization says this isn&#39;t a plan to lay off its human workforce, but will &quot;support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation.&quot; Yep. Those are certainly words.</p>

<p>The company also says it will &quot;support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally.&quot; That&#39;s corporate speak for &quot;my way or the highway.&quot;</p>
<p>CFO Bae Dong-geun said during a recent earnings call that &quot;individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level.&quot; Oh yeah. It&#39;s worth noting that Krafton <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette"><ins>recently noted record profits</ins></a>. It looks like these profits will not be going to the staff, but rather will be funnelled into large-scale investments in AI. It&#39;s a tale as old as time, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/square-enix-is-laying-off-more-developers-in-the-uk-and-us-as-it-refocuses-on-japan-201907305.html"><ins>or at least modern AI</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The company plans to &quot;automate work centered on agentic AI&quot; including the development of an &quot;AI-centered management system.&quot; It&#39;s freezing all hiring except for those &quot;developing original intellectual property and AI-related personnel.&quot;</p>
<div id="fd8b1a79da084ac7bd3c39c9f110a68e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MIT report: 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing.<br> <a href="https://t.co/xejHRlf43q">https://t.co/xejHRlf43q</a></p>— Anthony Baldi (@anthbaldi) <a href="https://twitter.com/anthbaldi/status/1977371254572118055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>Agentic AI systems have, so far, proven to be underwhelming when tasked with taking the reins. A recent MIT study noted that <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/21/an-mit-report-that-95-of-ai-pilots-fail-spooked-investors-but-the-reason-why-those-pilots-failed-is-what-should-make-the-c-suite-anxious/"><ins>95 percent of these efforts fail</ins></a>.

In other words, good luck in your forthcoming endeavors, Krafton. <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-complicated-subnautica-2-lawsuit-just-took-a-bizarre-twist-175829731.html"><ins>You&#39;re gonna need it</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/subnautica-publisher-transforms-into-ai-first-company-and-introduces-voluntary-resignation-policy-181042212.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most recent Switch 2 software update looks to have bricked many third-party docks and related accessories, according to users <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/">across the internet</a> and a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081">report by <em>Kotaku</em></a>. We don&#39;t know if this was an intentional move by Nintendo or simply an accident. Engadget has reached out to the company for clarification.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 update 21.0.0 brings some much-needed quality-of-life features, like the ability to turn off autoplaying videos in the eShop and new icons that indicate whether a game is digital or physical. However, it also brought along the aforementioned dock hiccup.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Switch 2 owners have reported that these docks either don&#39;t work at all or are now much more finicky, often requiring a restart. This doesn&#39;t seem to have impacted all third-party docks, but complaints are coming in pertaining to many different products. YouTuber AustinJohnPlays tested out two different Switch 2 dock dongles after the update and reported that both were borked.</p>
<div id="266e44ca2b444ef2b8669b10eadcae24"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrBCQTmb9SU?si=3oHevV75lgstoHkf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Nintendo has responded to these allegations, suggesting that this was an accident that only impacted certain devices. The company wrote that it &quot;does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility.&quot; Sometimes new console firmware impacts third-party accessories. At the very least, this was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/266542-third-party-docks-bricking-switches-nintendo-firmware-update">something that happened to the original Switch</a> a couple of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companies that make these accessories will have to perform their own software updates to get things going again. In the meantime, exercise caution when buying a third-party dock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update, November 14 2025, 12:55PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated to include Nintendo&#39;s response and a likely cause of the issue.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-new-nintendo-switch-2-system-update-just-bricked-many-third-party-docks-194551477.html?src=rss]]></description>

The game was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-sims-like-paralives-hits-early-access-in-december-220014257.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">supposed to hit early access</a> on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Steam</a> on December 8, but lead developer Alex Massé and the team at Paralives Studio have pushed back the release date to May 25.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/ParalivesGame/status/1989347579856113871" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Massé explained</a> that the team expanded its playtests in the lead up to the early access period, &quot;and the latest feedback we received made us realize the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release.&quot; While the character creator and in-depth home builder modes seem to be in a solid place, playtesters encountered &quot;impactful bugs&quot; in the live mode and it appears that there isn&#39;t yet quite enough to do in the town. &quot;We feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community,&quot; Massé wrote. The team plans to improve the game&#39;s onboarding experience too.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message from the Paralives team: <a href="https://t.co/xNk2nOf1Kv">pic.twitter.com/xNk2nOf1Kv</a></p>— Paralives (@ParalivesGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ParalivesGame/status/1989347579856113871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p><em>Paralives </em>has been in development for six years, and the team has grown from two or three people in the first couple of years to an average of 10. Having such a small team meant that the developers &quot;had to alternate long stretches of development” between the three parts of the game, Massé wrote. &quot;We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game. This would ensure <em>Paralives </em>offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards.&quot;</p><p>Paralives Studio will stream 45 minutes of gameplay on its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Paralives" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">YouTube channel</a> at noon ET on November 25. Massé said you&#39;ll get to see what the game looks like now, including some of the current features. The team will provide more details on aspects it plans to improve before the early access release. You can expect more streams and videos in the coming months. It&#39;s expected that <em>Paralives </em>will remain in early access for two years while the team adds the features and content it plans to.</p><p><em>Paralives </em>is an indie alternative to the likes of The Sims and <em>InZOI</em>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each week, we check major retailers looking for notable discounts on iPads. Those deals almost never show up on Apple&#39;s own website, but Target, Walmart and, of course, Amazon tend to have at least a few worthy discounts on Apple&#39;s slates. We update this list at least once per week and, while we&#39;re at it, we add standout discounts on other Apple gear, from the wearable Apple Watch to the portable MacBook. Why all the focus on Apple devices? The company&#39;s gear consistently ranks among our top picks for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html">tablets</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">smartwatches</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html">laptops</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">more</a>.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that we&#39;re just heading into the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday shopping season</a> (it used to be just one day, but the beast has grown). So the discounts you see now may very well get even better as we get closer to the end of November. And if you don&#39;t see something you were hoping for on sale (thinking specifically about the AirPods Pro 3 here), check back. For now, these are the top deals on Apple gear we could find.</p>

It&#39;s not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it&#39;s a bit faster. (Though we&#39;d still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off.</p>

The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it&#39;s a strong value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While most of the enormous Call of Duty audience buys each annual entry without hesitation for its multiplayer offering, the single-player campaign is also a big part of the experience. CoD campaigns are often big on popcorn silliness and refreshingly tight. Some people just like to start a game and see its credits roll within a weekend, you know? But judging by the early impressions of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>that are beginning to surface online, it sounds like this year’s campaign comes with some pretty major caveats.</p>
<p>I admittedly haven’t played the game myself yet, but <em>IGN</em> is one of the outlets that has gone live with its 6/10 <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review"><ins>review</ins></a>, which reveals that the campaign’s always-online nature means it can’t be paused, and if you’re idle for what the game deems to be too long it’ll boot you out. For a mode that is traditionally offline and totally separate from the online portion of the game, this might come as a shock to some players.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It gets worse. While the official <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blackops7"><ins>website</ins></a> for <em>Black Ops 7 </em>states that the campaign can be played solo or with a &quot;squad,&quot; it definitely emphasises its co-op nature first. A campaign that facilitates co-op is usually a good thing, but here it sounds like very few considerations are made for single players. You can’t fill in spots in the four-person squads with AI companions, so if you don’t have three friends handy, you’re not getting the desired experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objectives clearly designed for multiple players are reportedly tediously repetitive when you have to do all of them on your own. Many games are built entirely around co-op and that’s fine, but it seems like a pretty dramatic departure for a series that has always accommodated the solo player. According to <em>IGN</em>’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-is-online-only-with-no-checkpoints-or-pausing-and-will-kick-you-if-youre-idle-for-too-long"><ins>coverage</ins></a> there are no checkpoints either, so if you don’t finish a mission in a single sitting — not always possible for people with busy lives — you’ll lose all your progress. As you presumably will if your Wi-Fi dies.</p>
<p>For groups willing to live with all these potentially very awkward conditions, the <em>Black Ops 7</em> campaign promises &quot;high-stakes challenges across a wide spectrum of environments, from the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast, and even into the deepest corners of the human psyche.&quot; Presumably that last bit doesn’t refer to the rageful thoughts of someone who just lost all their progress because they had to answer the front door.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> also offers the traditional multiplayer and Zombies modes that will no doubt keep you busy until next year. It’s out today on Xbox (included with Game Pass), PS5, PS4 and PC.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-cant-pause-your-game-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-always-online-campaign-172707048.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We tested all the major live TV streaming services and, after comparing the features and costs, we still think they are a better deal than paying for cable or satellite — but the gulf between the options is narrowing. Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was. <br><br>Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. Now that football season is in full swing, live TV streaming is still the best way to catch all possible live matchups, as well as other major and minor sports leagues, linear cable-style channels and local networks. We also tried out a number of free, ad-supported live TV services (FAST) and included our impressions below. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.<br><br><strong>Editor’s note</strong>: Disney’s channels (which include ESPN, ABC and more) are <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html"><ins>currently dark</ins></a> on YouTube TV.

<p>On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see <em>all</em> Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/2025-nfl-season/">monthly options</a> for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere.</p>

They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports.</p>

<p>There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription.

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-live-tv-streaming-service">What to look for in a live TV streaming service</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-stream-live-tv"><strong>How to stream live TV</strong></h3> 
<p>Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or <a data-i13n="cpos:43;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">streaming device</a> and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-monthly-price"><strong>Monthly Price</strong></h3> 
<p>When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the <a data-i13n="cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html">price difference</a> between live TV and a <a data-i13n="cpos:45;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html">standard video streaming app</a>. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-local-channels"><strong>Local channels</strong></h3> 
<p>Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p> 
<p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:46;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D9NZTGLF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=HD+antenna&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYFrBzybV7JrmQ6EI0-2SiNJpVRVKi5fSnmf_a2Xkzyj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAntenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels%2Fdp%2FB0D9NZTGLF" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels/dp/B0D9NZTGLF">HD antenna</a>, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p> 
<p>But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a <a data-i13n="cpos:47;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-signs-deal-to-host-live-tv-channels-in-france-153852590.html">recently announced deal</a> with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1&#39;s live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-live-sports-coverage"><strong>Live sports coverage</strong></h3> 
<p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out <a data-i13n="cpos:48;pos:1" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=upcoming+nfl+games">upcoming games</a> (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.</p> 
<p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a data-i13n="cpos:49;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p> 
<p>I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Peacock TV;elmt:;cpos:50;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peacock+TV&amp;linkText=Peacock&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnRVh_g_jgVhSp7LBrtJVkcMpZ3bn_n25jQbBiVS3P6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.peacocktv.com/">Peacock</a> carries <a data-i13n="cpos:51;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-ui-update-183247828.html">live</a> Premier League matches, <a data-i13n="cpos:52;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-nfl-wild-card-game-broke-streaming-records-103503762.html">Sunday Night Football</a> games and aired the 2024 <a data-i13n="cpos:53;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-2024-paris-olympics-coverage-includes-enhanced-multiview-options-190047120.html">Olympic Games</a> from Paris. <a data-i13n="cpos:54;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-x-ray-replays-thursday-night-football-173723667.html">Thursday Night Football</a> as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:55;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-tv-rights-go-to-espn-nbc-and-amazon-as-tnt-is-rejected-230811550.html">NBA and WNBA games</a> are on Amazon Prime and <a data-i13n="cpos:56;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html">Christmas Day Football</a> airs on Netflix.

<p><strong>Traditional cable networks</strong></p> 
<p>Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.</p> 
<p>Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps.

Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-on-demand-streaming"><strong>On-demand streaming</strong></h3> 
<p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p> 
<p>Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-digital-video-recordings-dvr-limits"><strong>Digital video recordings (DVR) limits</strong></h3> 
<p>Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.</p> 
<p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-simultaneous-streams-and-profiles-per-account"><strong>Simultaneous streams and profiles per account</strong></h3> 
<p>Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.</p> 
<p>Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-picture-in-picture-mode-and-multiview"><strong>Picture-in-picture mode and multiview</strong></h3> 
<p>Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this.

<p>Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tiers-packages-and-add-ons"><strong>Tiers, packages and add-ons</strong></h3> 
<p>Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-live-tv-streaming-services">How we tested live TV streaming services</h2> 
<p>When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the <a data-i13n="cpos:88;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p> 
<p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p> 
<p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-live-tv-streaming-faqs">Live TV Streaming FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-live-streaming"><strong>What is live streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. <em>Live</em> streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-streaming-and-live-streaming"><strong>What is the difference between streaming and live streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-streaming-service-is-best-for-live-tv"><strong>What streaming service is best for live TV?</strong></h3> 
<p>FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-cost-effective-tv-streaming-service"><strong>What is the most cost effective TV streaming service?</strong></h3> 
<p>Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-it-cheaper-to-have-cable-or-streaming"><strong>Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don&#39;t have contracts.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-streaming-service-has-all-the-tv-channels"><strong>What streaming service has all the TV channels?</strong></h3> 
<p>No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, <a data-i13n="cpos:101;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/">according to Neilsen</a>. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-popular-live-tv-streaming-platform"><strong>What is the most popular live TV streaming platform?</strong></h3> 
<p>YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:102;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/">letter</a> from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter <a data-i13n="cpos:103;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/disney-earnings-inside-out-2-deadpool-wolverine-disney-hulu-streaming-theme-parks-1236176347/">earnings</a> put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s <a data-i13n="cpos:104;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sling-tv-slips-below-2-135658433.html">customer count dipped</a> from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to <a data-i13n="cpos:105;pos:1" href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2024/Fubo-Closed-Q3-2024-With-21-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Growth-and-1.613M-Subscribers-in-North-America/default.aspx">1.6 million</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-safe-are-free-streaming-services-and-websites"><strong>How safe are free streaming services and websites?</strong></h3> 
<p>You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.</p> 
<p>But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">budgeting app</a>. There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50.</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can&#39;t be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can&#39;t redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you&#39;ll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you&#39;ve set. There&#39;s also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what&#39;s been happening with your money that month. You&#39;ll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it&#39;s a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven&#39;t yet found a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint replacement</a>.

That was me not too long ago when I started searching for something that could get rid of the pilling on some of my most loved pieces of clothing. Blessedly, I stumbled upon the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B00E3862DE&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c2468424-8ef5-4416-9d94-da26698b7118&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Philips+Fabric+Shaver&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAVcx60_ADYIA86h9WZgtpm2NyeAbUNCrS3qu83o3rv7L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes%2Fdp%2FB00E3862DE%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes/dp/B00E3862DE/?th=1">Philips Fabric Shaver</a>, a type of device I didn&#39;t even know existed, and decided to give it a shot. It&#39;s now an essential piece of tech in my house, and you don&#39;t have to pay as much as I did for it thanks to this Black Friday deal that knocks it down to $13.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="848802afed304ca5b041be2cdb9f74de" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes/dp/B00E3862DE/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Sure, it may not seem revolutionary — especially if you already knew of the wonders of such devices — but it was for me. I have a lot of T-shirts, joggers, sweaters and more that I&#39;ve had for at least three years and wear regularly. We also have a bunch of throw blankets around the house, partially because I love a good throw, and partially because my cat demands soft spots on which to sleep. All of those well-worn, well-loved fabrics have pilled over time, and I was tired of picking at the pills myself.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>This Philips Fabric Shaver makes it so I never have to do that anymore. It runs on two AA batteries, has a simple on-off switch and a shaving head with three sized holes that, as you glide it over your sweater or blanket, catches the pills and shaves them right off. It&#39;s literally as simple as that; after I tried it the first time on a pair of joggers, I spent far too much time running around my house and through my closet de-pilling as many things as I could. All the little fabric bits collect in a removable chamber that you simply empty as often as you need into the trash. If you&#39;re like me and try to make the most of the wardrobe you have and not buy new clothing all the time, this little gadget will keep the pieces in your closet looking fresh.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/you-need-a-fabric-shaver-and-my-favorite-is-only-13-for-black-friday-163402235.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer.</p>

What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.<br><br>Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday tech deals</a> you can get right now, and we&#39;ll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-have-arrived-the-best-tech-sales-from-amazon-apple-lego-anker-and-others-so-far-100052657.html?src=rss]]></description>

It can be even more daunting if you’re trying to stick to a budget all while getting the folks you love things that they will really appreciate. But there’s also a good chance you’re getting fed bad gift ideas (and just as bad deals) if you’re browsing the web frantically searching as we get closer and closer to the holidays.<br><br>Allow us at Engadget to help you through it. Here, you’ll find all of our holiday gift guides collected in one place, so you can more easily find the best Christmas gifts you need this year. Are you looking for white elephant gift ideas?

<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Secret Santa gift exchanges are supposed to be fun, but it’s easy to overthink it. You want a gift that feels thoughtful without being awkward, useful without being boring, and most importantly, affordable. The sweet spot is under $50, which is plenty to find something that fits your recipient’s personality. Whether you’re buying for a co-worker you only chat with at the coffee machine, a friend who already has everything or a cousin who never gives you ideas, there are clever options that will make them smile.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items. But it would be wrong to think that only the most expensive tech is worth gifting. Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re like us, Nintendo holds a special place in your heart thanks to iconic characters like Mario, Peach and Donkey Kong and multiple generations of best-selling consoles.

<p>Some moms really do mean it when they say they don’t <em>need</em> any gifts. But those same moms will probably appreciate getting something thoughtful and personal — a gift that shows you put in a bit of consideration.

Since we spend our days testing and otherwise thinking about tech, most of the presents here have a gadget spin, but all of them are a heck of a lot more unique than a candle and a bath bomb.</p>

<p>Admittedly, we have seen this model a bit cheaper in the past, but if you’re on cooking duty for Thanksgiving, you might not have the option of waiting until what <em>could</em> be a deeper discount on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-tech-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-anker-and-others-100052831.html">Black Friday</a>. And the DZ401 is the perfect air fryer for the holiday season, owing to its trademark dual baskets, which allow you to cook up two completely different foods simultaneously. It takes up a fair amount of space, but it’s worth it if you have a lot of hungry mouths to feed.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>This 10-quart fryer includes a smart cook thermometer and six cooking modes, including air broil, roast and dehydrate alongside the default air fry mode. The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert.</p> 
<p>The Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">buying guide</a> for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, Anthropic published a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-countering-misuse-aug-2025"><ins>report</ins></a> detailing how its Claude AI model had been weaponized in a &quot;vibe hacking&quot; extortion scheme. The company has continued to monitor how the agentic AI is being used to coordinate cyberattacks, and now <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage"><ins>claims</ins></a> that a state-backed group of hackers in China utilized Claude in an attempted infiltration of 30 corporate and political targets around the world, with some success.</p>
<p>In what it labeled &quot;the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,&quot; Anthropic said that the hackers first chose their targets, which included unnamed tech companies, financial institutions and government agencies. They then used Claude Code to develop an automated attack framework, after successfully bypassing the model’s training to avoid harmful behavior. This was achieved by breaking the planned attack into smaller tasks that didn’t obviously reveal their wider malicious intent, and telling Claude that it was a cybersecurity firm using the AI for defensive training purposes.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After writing its own exploit code, Anthropic said Claude was then able to steal usernames and passwords that allowed it to extract &quot;a large amount of private data&quot; through backdoors it had created. The obedient AI reportedly even went to the trouble of documenting the attacks and storing the stolen data in separate files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hackers used AI for 80-90 percent of its operation, only occasionally intervening, and Claude was able to orchestrate an attack in far less time than humans could have done. It wasn’t flawless, with some of the information it obtained turning out to be publicly available, but Anthropic said that attacks like this will likely become more sophisticated and effective over time.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why an AI company would want to publicize the dangerous potential of its own technology, but Anthropic says its investigation also acts as evidence of why the assistant is &quot;crucial&quot; for cyber defense. It said Claude was successfully used to analyze the threat level of the data it collected, and ultimately sees it as a tool that can assist cybersecurity professionals when future attacks happen.</p>
<p>Claude is by no means the only AI that has benefited cybercriminals. Last year, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/russian-and-north-korean-hackers-used-openai-tools-to-hone-cyberattacks-152424393.html"><ins>OpenAI</ins></a> said that its generative AI tools were being used by hacker groups with ties to China and North Korea. They reportedly used GAI to assist with code debugging, researching potential targets and drafting phishing emails. OpenAI said at the time that it had blocked the groups&#39; access to its systems.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-ai-was-used-by-chinese-hackers-to-run-a-cyberattack-142313551.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company has been working on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-tests-feature-that-could-open-it-up-to-other-messaging-apps-085433722.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">enabling</a> third-party chats since 2023 after the rules of the bloc’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA) came into effect. It apparently held small scale tests over the past few months to make sure WhatsApp does work with BirdyChat and Haiket, and it will roll out integration with the services across Europe “soon.”</p><p>Users will be able to send messages, images, voice messages, videos and files between the messaging services whether they’re on Android or iOS. To those wondering, any messaging service Meta teams up with will need to have the same level of end-to-end encryption as WhatsApp under DMA’s rules. Users will see a notification in their Settings tab on WhatsApp over the coming months when BirdyChat and Haiket integration becomes available, telling them how they can opt-in to third-party chats. They can choose not to enable the feature at all or to switch it off anytime they want. </p><p>When Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/meta-shares-how-whatsapp-and-messenger-will-interact-with-other-messaging-apps-in-the-eu-143021269.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">released details</a> detailing how WhatsApp will work with other messengers, the company said that users will be able to create group chats with their friends on its partner apps. That feature won’t be available at launch, though, and will come later when Meta’s partners are ready to support the capability. Meta also said that it will continue expanding WhatsApp’s interoperability with more apps, as it’s required to do so under the DMA. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/whatsapp-enables-interoperability-with-two-other-messengers-in-the-eu-140000835.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Earlier this year, I played <em>Metroid Prime</em> for the first time in at least a decade. Back in 2023, Nintendo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-prime-remastered-switch-230628691.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">released a remastered version</a> of the 2002 classic for the Switch, and I felt like dusting it off once we finally knew <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> would arrive this year after about a decade in development. The original <em>Metroid Prime</em> holds up surprisingly well for a 23-year-old game, but there were plenty of times where it showed its age. The platforming often felt overly clunky, as precise control over Samus Aran is not the game’s strong suit. Similarly, dealing with larger hordes of energy-sucking Metroids could get pretty frustrating, again due to a lack of precision.&nbsp;</p><p>But the main feeling I came away from the game with was excitement over a fully modernized Metroid Prime experience. I’ve been interested in seeing how the lush alien worlds, monstrous enemies and first-person combat would feel on a current console, built with today’s technology and the many improvements that have come to game design since 2002. I finally got a chance to play about 90 minutes of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond </em>last week and nothing I saw diminished my excitement for the series being brought into the current decade — even if the game felt almost too familiar at times.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fN5zFkeA4A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>I played two segments of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. The first is an opening sequence that Nintendo made available for people to try at the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-sign-up-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-experience-170052140.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Switch 2 demo experiences</a> earlier this year before the console launched, while the second is a longer slice that takes place on a gorgeous alien planet where it seems the bulk of the game will likely take place. That first segment is the classic “get the player acquainted with the controls” level where Samus flies in to help defend a base under attack. Since I had played the Switch version of <em>Metroid Prime</em> recently, I felt right at home with the controls even though a few buttons were remapped. All of the classic Metroid moves, including charge blasts, the morph ball, the missile cannon, the scanning visor and more are intact here, and I quickly slipped back into the routine of scanning enemies for weak points and blasting away.&nbsp;</p><p>Right from the jump, the game looks fantastic. There’s an extensive cutscene (at least for a Metroid game) that shows Samus flying in to save the day through a battle-torn base, and everything from the flash of fireball explosions to small details on Samus’s ship give off a level of detail that we simply haven’t seen in a Metroid game before.&nbsp;</p><p>I was playing the game on the Switch 2, in both handheld mode and hooked up to a TV and it looked great either way. The aforementioned explosions popped nicely in HDR and the frame rate never stuttered in a way that I picked up on. As usual, Nintendo’s art direction is top-notch, but this is the first Metroid Prime game made on a console with some power behind it (remember, <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em> came out on the original Wii). The game isn’t quite aiming for photorealistic graphics, but it’s closer than almost any other Nintendo game I can think of. The combo of impeccable style and a modern resolution that finally lets the Metroid world shine is thrilling, and I can’t wait to see more variety in the worlds that Samus explores.</p><p>There’s also a lot more voice chatter than in the original <em>Metroid Prime.</em> As you get dropped into defending the base under attack, plenty of other soldiers recognize Samus, ask for help, tell her where to go and generally praise her for being a badass. It’s a lot more voice work than I’m used to in a Metroid game, and it goes a long way towards making the journey feel less isolated.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Metroid_Prime_4_jungle.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Metroid_Prime_4_jungle.jpg" style="height:1097px;width:1950px;" alt="A screenshot showing the jungle world of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond." data-uuid="385b55e0-264f-4b4e-a13f-1cec97c359c0"><figcaption>A screenshot showing the jungle world of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>The second area I got to explore looks even better than the somewhat generic base where the game kicks off. It’s a classic Metroid world that mixes natural beauty with a mysterious, alien culture. And, of course, a lot of the nature wants to kill you for invading its territory (or possibly because it is being controlled by outside forces). The big boss of the demo was cut from this cloth: a giant tentacled plant flinging its giant spiked arms at you and firing off poisonous flowers. A classic Metroid battle if ever there was one, albeit one that felt not wildly different from some of the boss battles from <em>Metroid Prime</em>. That said, the scope of the battle felt bigger, due to the size of the arena and how the plant’s tentacles made maneuvering and getting off clear shots a challenge. While the boss clearly had a central body right in the middle of the room, the tentacles made it feel like it was all around me, at all times</p><p>This boss felt like an upscaled but familiar version of ones from past games, and it was far from the only thing that felt familiar. For example, the game still uses save stations scattered throughout the map to save your progress rather than just autosaving at significant points. That’s a throwback I didn’t exactly miss and didn’t expect to see in 2025. Plenty of the music cues and sound effects felt like they could have been lifted straight from other Metroid Prime games, and the basic move set and weapons Samus has early in the game is nearly identical to how you start <em>Metroid Prime</em>. Naturally, something happens where she loses most of those abilities and has to regain them to progress — in the demo, I had to find the Morph Ball power up to move on, just as you do in nearly every Metroid game before.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Metroid_Prime_4_psychic.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Metroid_Prime_4_psychic.jpg" style="height:1097px;width:1950px;" alt="Samus Aran uses her new abilities to unlock a way forward." data-uuid="ae93532c-a9be-431d-a734-b182cfa9771b"><figcaption>Samus Aran uses her new abilities to unlock a way forward.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>At times, it felt like the game was leaning a bit too heavily on the already-established framework rather than trying something new. But given that I was early in the game, I’m allowing for there to be a lot of unexpected changes to come. And I did get a chance to try out the biggest gameplay change Nintendo has teased thus far (no, not the motorcycle): new psychic abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>These powers, at least in the demo, are primarily used for solving environmental puzzles, as they provide a new way to interact with various objects and structures. But there’s also a combat component that I needed to use to beat the aforementioned boss. You can charge and fire off a sort of psychic beam — once it leaves your blaster, time slows to nearly a crawl and you can take control of its direction with the analog stick. While fighting the boss, I had to guide the beam around a host of obstacles to hit each of the three tentacles; once I did that, the monster was vulnerable and I could then charge in and blast it with my conventional weapons. You can see some examples of this power in action in the video below.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmwAhBxakw4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>I wish I got a chance to see how these powers would evolve throughout the game, and I’m definitely intrigued to see how they manage to separate the gameplay in <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> from the aspects of it that feel merely like an updated version of what came before. And to be honest, I’m not sad the game feels familiar. Plenty of people haven’t experienced the Metroid Prime series before or haven’t played it in more than a decade, and many of the familiar aspects felt like a perfect example of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” And it won’t be long before we can all find out if <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> finds a way to really stand out from its predecessors after all this time. The game arrives on December 5 for Switch and Switch 2.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-beyond-thrillingly-brings-the-series-into-the-modern-era-140000932.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you&#39;ll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don&#39;t already have one you can use.

If you aren't looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 34 percent off, bringing it down to just $85 from its usual price of $130.</p> 
<p>The Apple AirPods 4 are the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">best budget AirPods</a> you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="f71185ad35744465924f49850dc8e26e" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price.</p> 
<p>This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-4-drop-to-a-record-low-price-before-black-friday-162917546.html?src=rss]]></description>

At first, it could <em>only</em> stream games from your PlayStation 5, it lacked core features for a handheld like Bluetooth audio and it felt a bit overpriced at $200 for such a limited product. Add on the fact that home streaming can be notoriously unreliable, since it depends entirely on your ISP and home networking setup, and the Portal simply didn't make much sense. But in 2024 <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-cloud-streaming-makes-the-playstation-portal-far-more-useful-171038751.html" data-i13n="slk:Sony finally added limited cloud streaming for PS Plus titles;cpos:1;pos:1">Sony finally added limited cloud streaming for PS Plus titles</a>, and last week it went even further by letting you <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-stream-ps5-games-you-own-over-the-cloud-on-the-playstation-portal-135025829.html" data-i13n="slk:stream games you own directly from the cloud;cpos:2;pos:1">stream games you own directly from the cloud</a>.

Sure, it's still far from a perfect device, but at least it's more functional and significantly less than the PS5 today. Just be aware you'll need to subscribe to the $18 a month (or $160 a year) PlayStation Plus Premium plan to access the cloud streaming features.</p><p><core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="d359d293-b697-4e88-a783-2bc6e64244f1" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Portal-Remote-Player-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DSLTZ6M3?th=1"></core-commerce></p><p>While my hardware frustrations with the PlayStation Portal remain (more on those later), I can't deny that it's a genuinely great handheld for streaming games from the cloud. Jumping into <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>typically takes between 15 to 30 seconds, and it often loads directly into the game world if I'm continuing from a recent session. The game also plays smoothly, with no noticeable stuttering or lag, and I can still choose between the graphics-heavy 30 fps modes or the smoother 60 fps performance option. It's far from the ideal way to play <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which demands an enormous screen and capable speakers, but it's fine in a pinch.</p><p>In comparison, using Remote Play to access my PlayStation 5 Pro remains as headache-inducing as it did when the PS Portal launched. The handheld can't consistently wake up the PS5 Pro from standby mode, so I'm forced to turn on the console manually if I ever plan to use the Portal. If my PS5 Pro is on, the Portal can typically connect in around five seconds, and it takes another five to ten seconds to launch <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. Gameplay is typically smooth via Remote Play, but there's occasional stuttering that can interfere with intense combat sequences.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/PS_Portal_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/PS_Portal_2.jpg" style="height:1418px;width:2500px;" alt="PlayStation Portal playing Ghost of Yotei." data-uuid="464c902d-c2ec-417b-afff-9260fd1613d1"><figcaption>PlayStation Portal playing Ghost of Yotei.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>My main issue with the PlayStation Portal at launch was that I simply couldn't trust it. Sometimes it would let me remotely connect to my console with no problems, and sometimes it would simply refuse. I've got a fairly robust Wi-Fi 6 networking setup and AT&amp;T gigabit fiber, so my connectivity shouldn't be much of an issue. But clearly something about my networking configuration doesn't play well with the Portal for Remote Play, even if I connect my PS5 Pro via Ethernet.&nbsp;</p><p>Strangely enough, the PlayStation Portal is far more reliable at streaming games from servers thousands of miles away than it is remotely connecting to the console a few dozen feet away from me. That just goes to show how far cloud streaming has come — it practically feels like local gameplay now. I suppose that shouldn't be too surprising for Sony, since it's only pumping out 1080p streams. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-geforce-now-with-rtx-5080-gpus-is-a-cloud-gaming-revelation-130000231.html" data-i13n="slk:NVIDIA's GeForce Now;cpos:4;pos:1">NVIDIA's GeForce Now</a> has proven it's possible to stream PC games in 4K, so long as you have gobs of bandwidth to support it.</p><p>The best thing I can say about the PlayStation Portal now is that I can finally trust it — up to a point, anyway. I had no trouble signing onto its streaming servers to play <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>and <em>Spider-Man 2</em> on my home network, and I was also able to stream games while tethering on my phone. But the Portal remains a useless device if you're stuck somewhere without decent internet access. You can forget about using it on a plane, even with fast in-flight Wi-Fi, or at hotels with crummy internet and no cellular reception.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/1a5d82f0-a8f3-11ef-9f69-504e04628914.jpeg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/1a5d82f0-a8f3-11ef-9f69-504e04628914.jpeg" style="height:660px;width:1241px;" alt="Spider-Man 2 on the PlayStation Portal" data-uuid="ebb9bae6-1bd9-415a-a48a-adf9796bfbc7"><figcaption>Spider-Man 2 on the PlayStation Portal</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Given its need for decent connectivity and its clunky design, the PlayStation Portal also remains a terrible gaming option on the go. You'll need to find a large case to fit the Portal's huge controller and delicate display, a combination that really does look like a tablet shoved between Sony's DualSense gamepads. It's simply smarter to travel with the slimmer Switch 2, and I'd argue even the massive Steam Deck is easier to stuff into a backpack. And it’s worth noting you can also use apps on the Steam Deck to Remote Play from your console, and you can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sLB_db6w6Q" data-i13n="slk:install the PlayStation Plus Windows app;cpos:5;pos:1">install the PlayStation Plus Windows app</a> to stream games from the cloud.</p><p>I'm also still annoyed that Sony didn't include Bluetooth connectivity in the Portal. If you want wireless audio, you'll either have to use Sony's Pulse Explore earbuds or Pulse Elite headphones. You'll have to plug in a separate Bluetooth receiver if you want to use AirPods or any other wireless headphones. You'll definitely want to invest in some sort of audio solution if you plan to game on the Portal for long sessions, since its tinny speakers simply can't do justice to <em>Ghost of Yotei's </em>immersive soundscape.</p><p>Not surprisingly, cloud gaming didn’t change the Portal’s battery life much. I still saw between four and five hours of play time (broken into dad-friendly chunks, of course). And if you’re on some sort of marathon session, you can always plug in to charge. Since the Portal isn’t using any local hardware to power games — it’s really just decoding video and pushing data over its network connection — you can also expect more reliable battery life than other handhelds. The Switch 2, for example, could last between two to six hours, depending on what you’re playing.</p><p>While I still can’t wholeheartedly recommend the PlayStation Portal to every gamer, its latest updates make it a more viable option for PlayStation diehards. Maybe you’ll have better luck with Remote Play than me. And if you’re already a PS Plus subscriber, it’s the easiest way to access Sony’s cloud infrastructure. Or, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-playstation-portal-is-still-flawed-but-ive-learned-to-love-it-as-a-new-dad-120000850.html" data-i13n="slk:like Engadget’s Jeff Dunn;cpos:6;pos:1">like Engadget’s Jeff Dunn</a>, it could also be the ideal way to game while you juggle the struggles of being a new parent. At the very least, the Portal is no longer truly baffling, but it’s also still not a Vita 2.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-portal-in-2025-from-home-streaming-dud-to-cloud-streaming-star-130000144.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has announced a raft of new hardware, including a new VR headset, Steam Machine and Controller. The devices are all designed to usher in a new era of PC gaming, with Valve’s usual focus on the player. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html"><ins>Steam Frame</ins></a> is a slender VR headset that connects wirelessly to your PC and has a built-in battery to rid you of those pesky cables. That focus on freedom extends to the Frame operating as a standalone device, like the Meta Quest.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company has revived its long-loved (but not massively successful) <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html"><ins>Steam Machine</ins></a>. This new model has semi-custom AMD silicon capable of running 4K games at 60 frames per second. Valve says it’s roughly six times as powerful as its portable unit, the Steam Deck. Rounding out the list is the controller, which looks like a Steam Deck with the screen cut out. But it’s not as if that’s a bad thing, especially as it’s got TMR sensors which, while using a different underlying technology, promise the same benefits as a Hall Effect stick.</p>
<p>As someone on the not particularly game-y end of the spectrum, I use announcements like this as an exercise to see how excited <em>I would be</em>. To that end, I’m curious how much Valve will charge for this gear when it makes its debut early next year. On one hand, the performance promises laid out here are fairly substantial but, on the other, this is also a company that sells the base model Steam Deck for less than a Switch 2.</p>
<p>That said, I would certainly get off the couch if there was a new Half-Life game in the works, and that seems plausible here. Nathan Ingraham is certainly getting his little hopes up that the revival of the Steam Machine <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html"><ins>might see Valve revive something else</ins></a> too.</p>

Thanks to a streaming benefit for subscribers, you can then sign up for Peacock at no extra cost.</p> 
<p>Walmart+ subscribers are able to choose between a Peacock Premium or a Paramount+ Essential subscription. Considering Peacock premium would run you $110 for the year on its own, signing up for Walmart+ while this discount is available gets you access to the streaming service for less than half the normal cost.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

Here are the best power banks you can buy, with picks ranging from small MagSafe packs to massive laptop batteries and everything in between.</p>

<p>You may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Independent;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1149d18a-366d-41e7-9cfa-7ce4d0fd6835&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Independent&amp;linkText=just+such+a+thing+happened&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy1hbmQtYWR2aWNlL2hvbmcta29uZy1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1iYW5rLWIyNzE5MTY0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL25ld3MtYW5kLWFkdmljZS9ob25nLWtvbmctYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWZpcmUtcG93ZXItYmFuay1iMjcxOTE2NC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeU3AdLXhHs4rETBPmT2Fa8cfZB6yJ3Rqk5g0VxDNdcc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fnews-and-advice%2Fhong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/hong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html">just such a thing happened</a> in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-100-watt-hours-or-less-device">TSA</a> still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.</p> 
<p>Recently, Southwest Airlines was the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk">first in the industry</a> to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-capacity"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> 
<p>Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html">separate guide</a> that covers that entire category.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.</p> 
<p>You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wireless"><strong>Wireless</strong></h3> 
<p>Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhKVuT8-H1g">less efficient</a> than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank.</p> 
<p>Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/qi2/">Qi2</a> wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved.</p> 
<p>To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points. The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.facebook.com/Engadget/posts/the-best-magsafe-power-banks-for-your-iphone-httpsengtco4m1eij4/1307571497704209/">MagSafe</a> technology on iPhones were once the only handsets that were Qi2-compatible, but now Google’s <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixelsnap-is-googles-qi2-powered-answer-to-magsafe-for-the-pixel-10-series-160048306.html">Pixelsnap</a> tech brings both the higher speed and magnetic grip to Pixel 10 phones. Samsung may follow up with its own version in future releases.</p> 
<p>The latest wireless charging standard, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qi2-25w-wireless-charging-is-coming-to-iphones-and-major-android-smartphones-183013979.html">Q12 25W</a>, is supported by the new iPhone 17 phones as well as the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. Battery packs that are Qi2 25W-enabled are starting to hit the market as well, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0F37VLJQW&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1149d18a-366d-41e7-9cfa-7ce4d0fd6835&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Ugreen+MagFlow&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1VHUkVFTi1DZXJ0aWZpZWQtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ2hhcmdpbmctTWFnbmV0aWMvZHAvQjBGMzdWTEpRVy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTE0OWQxOGEtMzY2ZC00MWU3LTljZmEtN2NlNGQwZmQ2ODM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1VHUkVFTi1DZXJ0aWZpZWQtV2lyZWxlc3MtQ2hhcmdpbmctTWFnbmV0aWMvZHAvQjBGMzdWTEpRVy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT5A6QiOsKjUzeVpMblmEuHnfvE255GORR36nzi3S2fn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Certified-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic%2Fdp%2FB0F37VLJQW%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Certified-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic/dp/B0F37VLJQW/">Ugreen MagFlow</a> was the first on the scene.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> 
<p>USB-C ports can deliver faster charges than USB-A ports, and most of the portable chargers we recommend here have Type-C connections. But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind).</p> 
<p>There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them).</p> 
<p>As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds.</p> 
<p>Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along.</p> 
<p><strong>Design</strong></p> 
<p>Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-best-power-banks">How we test best power banks</h2> 
<p>Before I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office.</p>

<p>We&#39;re continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer).</p> 
<p>I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used a 140W cable from Anker.</p> 
<p>For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing:</p>

I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful.</p>

It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up.</p>

It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-power-bank-faqs">Power bank FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-portable-power-bank-and-a-portable-charger"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger?</strong></h3> 
<p>A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.</p> 
<p>Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-fast-charging-actually-ruin-your-battery"><strong>Does fast charging actually ruin your battery?</strong></h3> 
<p>Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.</p> 
<p>While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a <a data-i13n="cpos:73;pos:1" href="https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/vehiclebatteries/FastChargeEffects.pdf">study on EV batteries</a> (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.</p> 
<p>In short, fast charging could be <em>slightly</em> harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-use-a-power-bank-for-all-your-devices"><strong>Can you use a power bank for all your devices?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery.

That brings the cost of a full year down to $35, giving you access to guided meditations, courses and stress-management tools that can help you stay balanced heading into the new year.</p> 
<p>Headspace has become one of the most recognizable names in digital mindfulness. The app blends practical meditation guidance with structured courses and calming soundscapes designed to make everyday stress easier to manage. Its programs cover everything from beginner-friendly introductions to mindfulness to focused content on topics like anxiety, productivity and sleep.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Subscribers get access to hundreds of guided sessions led by the Headspace team, including short daily practices that can be completed in a few spare minutes, plus longer courses that help build consistency. The app’s Sleepcasts and soundscapes are unique, designed to create a steady nighttime routine that promotes better rest. For mornings, there are breathing exercises and motivational mini-sessions that can help set focus for the day ahead.</p> 
<p>Headspace also includes personalized progress tracking, mood check-ins and optional reminders that make it easier to stay consistent with your new mindfulness habits. For anyone new to meditation, the app’s clear structure is a major strength. You don’t have to know where to start, since it suggests sessions based on your goals or current mood.</p> 
<p>This annual deal is ideal for users who want to stick with mindfulness practice over time, or anyone interested in incorporating a new habit into their lives. Paying for the year upfront typically saves money compared with the monthly plan, and the discount brings that cost down even further. Whether you’re learning the basics of meditation or refining an existing routine, the full library provides enough variety to keep things engaging throughout the year.</p>

Like group chats in messaging apps, you can create conversations with friends and family. In this instance, though, ChatGPT is one of the participants, building an itinerary as you plan a vacation, giving you ideas for renovation projects or helping you find a restaurant everyone in the chat would enjoy if you’re planning a night out. You can also use the feature to collaborate with classmates or colleagues. ChatGPT, for example, can outline reports based on the articles and notes you and your collaborator give it. </p><p>To start a group chat, you have to tap on the people icon at the top right corner of the screen on any new and existing conversation. ChatGPT will create a new conversation without your chat history if you start from an existing chat. You can then add people or share a link to the group conversation with one to 20 persons, who then have to set up a profile with their name, username and a photo. Take note that anybody who has the link can invite people in, and participants can mute or remove other participants from the chat anytime except for the group creator. And if anybody in the chat is under 18, the chatbot automatically limits sensitive content for everyone. </p><p>Group chat responses are powered by GPT‑5.1 Auto, which can choose which model to respond with based on the prompt. OpenAI says it taught the chatbot to follow the flow of group conversations, so it knows when to stay quiet and when to respond, but participants can always summon the chatbot by mentioning “ChatGPT.” The company also says that it will continue tweaking the feature based on feedback from early users before it’s rolled out widely. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-piloting-group-conversations-in-chatgpt-053255102.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin&#39;s New Glenn rocket has completed its second flight, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/13/new-glenn-blue-origin-nasa-launch/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>The Washington Post</em> reports</a>. The rocket launched from Florida&#39;s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Thursday, and successfully separated from its first-stage booster, which later landed on a sea platform Blue Origin calls &quot;Jacklyn.&quot;</p><p>The launch marks the first time the space startup has been able to catch a New Glenn booster for later reuse. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-launches-into-orbit-on-its-maiden-flight-073451555.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">maiden flight</a> of the rocket in January was successful in the sense that it got New Glenn into space, but Blue Origin wasn&#39;t able to save the booster from a watery grave. The company hoped to launch its second New Glenn mission on November 9, but <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origin-scrubs-new-glenns-second-flight-due-to-bad-weather-214349212.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">cancelled it</a> last minute due to weather.</p><p>New Glenn&#39;s second mission is also notable because of its payload: The rocket ferried <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/blue-origins-second-new-glenn-launch-will-carry-real-nasa-satellites-153000627.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">NASA satellites</a> to space that are destined for Mars as part of the agency&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/escapade/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">ESCAPADE mission</a>. Considering SpaceX&#39;s close relationship with NASA, Blue Origin working with the agency could be an important vote of confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also mean New Glenn is in a good position to help another company founded by Jeff Bezos accelerate its satellite plans. <em>The Post</em> writes that Blue Origin has an existing agreement with Amazon to launch its recently rebranded <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Amazon Leo</a> satellites into space. Leo is positioned as a competitor to Starlink, SpaceX&#39;s satellite internet service.</p><p>While SpaceX has completed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-will-attempt-starships-11th-flight-test-on-monday-204237829.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">many more launches</a> with its Starship rocket than Blue Origin has, it&#39;s also had more than a few <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">explosive failures</a> along the way. Blue Origin still needs more missions under its belt, but if it can repeat its success with New Glenn, it could prove to be a threat to SpaceX.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-safely-made-it-to-space-a-second-time-230324439.html?src=rss]]></description>

This will be an opt-in space for chatting with an AI assistant and getting help from it while browsing. The goal with this project appears to be giving users more control over when and how they choose to interact with AI. AI Window will be another option for users alongside the standard Firefox window and the Private Window, which will continue to offer more privacy protections. The feature is still in development, so interested users can sign up in Mozilla&#39;s blog post to be among the first users and provide feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>AI built into browsers is one of the current hot issues among tech companies. Every browser provider and AI operation appears to be engaged in an arms race to offer the best integrated solution. Mozilla isn&#39;t immune to that push; it also introduced an iOS tool for Firefox earlier this year where you can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/firefox-provides-ai-page-summaries-if-you-shake-your-iphone-145837557.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">shake your phone</a> to get an AI-generated summary of a web page. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mozilla-will-add-an-ai-window-to-firefox-225032453.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>
<p>Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html">VPN deal</a> this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to Proton VPN.</p>

Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.</p></li>

Under the App Store Mini Apps Partner Program, devs would pay a reduced rate of 15 percent, compared to the current 30 percent, on qualifying in-app purchases. Apple has a bunch of more <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">detailed explanations</a> and an FAQ about how the partner program will work and what mini apps are eligible.&nbsp;</p><p>Mini apps are "self-contained experiences" — often web-based games — that live within a larger "host" app. Apple has allowed developers to offer these experiences for years, but only allowed mini app developers to support in-app purchases of their own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-lets-apps-feature-streaming-games-chatbots-and-other-built-in-experiences-180016453.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">last year</a>. </p><p>In order to participate in the Mini Apps Partner Program, developers will need to meet a few additional requirements. To start, developers will need to support both iOS and iPadsOS functionality. They're also required to implement Apple's Advanced Commerce API, as well as the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-explains-how-it-will-comply-with-app-store-age-verification-requirements-in-texas-185934469.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Declared Age Range API</a>. The latter requirement would prevent underage users from circumventing parental controls by accessing a mini app with a higher age rating than the host app. </p><p>Apple's fee structure has been an ongoing subject of debate, and the company has faced global pressure from regulators to change its commission policies to prove it isn't engaged in monopolistic, anti-competitive practices. We've already seen some changes at Apple this year, as its legal saga with Epic Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/court-orders-apple-to-stop-collecting-fees-for-purchases-made-outside-the-app-store-110036376.html" data-i13n="slk:wound towards a conclusion;cpos:5;pos:1">wound towards a conclusion</a> and some of the App Store guidelines were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-allow-external-payment-options-123039994.html" data-i13n="slk:changed;cpos:6;pos:1">changed</a> to allow for external payment options.</p><p><strong>Update, November 13, 2025, 2PM PT:</strong> Added additional details about the Mini Apps Partner Program.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-halves-app-store-fees-for-mini-apps-190251153.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-04-amazon-internet-satellite-network-project-kuiper.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">introduced the project</a> in 2019 with the goal of offering internet in regions without a reliable connection, through a proposed constellation of over 3,000 satellites that could blanket 95 percent of the global population in high-speed internet. That constellation has yet to fully take shape, however. In the years following the Project Kuiper reveal, Amazon launched <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-first-internet-satellite-launch-was-a-success-202130763.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">prototype satellites</a>, detailed plans for a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-boosts-its-satellite-internet-network-with-the-help-of-space-lasers-123535946.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">space laser mesh network</a> and showed off <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-satellite-internet-antennas-can-double-as-picnic-tables-for-dolls-153450879.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the antennas</a> customers will use to connect to its network, but it didn&#39;t actually <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-deploys-the-first-project-kuiper-internet-satellites-140006298.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">launch the first 27 satellites</a> in its constellation until April 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, its competitor Starlink has had a much faster expansion. SpaceX launched the Starlink satellite internet service in beta in 2020, and has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">rapidly expanded it</a> since then. Now SpaceX has a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/t-mobile-is-offering-its-starlink-satellite-texting-feature-for-free-until-july-130044054.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">deal with T-Mobile</a> for satellite-enabled texting, and has struck up partnerships with airlines to test or offer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/alaska-air-will-offer-starlink-in-flight-internet-starting-next-year-120023852.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">internet connection on flights</a>. Rebranding Project Kuiper to Leo suggests Amazon is finally ready to think about its satellite network as a product in its own right, but the company still has some catching up to do.</p><p>Amazon hasn&#39;t shared a date for when its satellite internet service will be widely available for personal and commercial use, but you can sign-up on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://leo.amazon.com/" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Amazon Leo website</a> to receive updates as the company works towards launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html?src=rss]]></description>

But to say money is tight is an understatement this year. If Amazon’s<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.numerator.com/prime-big-deal-days/"> Prime Big Deal Days was any indicator</a>, folks are spending more on essentials than anything else during these big sales.

<p>Even if that’s the case, I’d recommend not overlooking tech entirely this Black Friday. After all, all of us have essential tech that we use every day, and more often than not, you can avoid paying full price for most of those gadgets (and all of the rest of the<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-2025-114500543.html"> best tech of the year</a>) if you&#39;re looking to add to your repertoire or you need a replacement. Personally, I&#39;m not eyeing a new smartphone or laptop this holiday shopping season, but there are a few tech purchases I’d like to make if the prices are right. This is the tech I’m hoping to save on this year during Black Friday.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

In October, the country&#39;s Competition Appeal Tribunal <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-loses-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-over-app-store-fees-184515613.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">determined</a> that Apple benefited from &quot;near absolute market power&quot; over app distribution and in-app payments and was &quot;abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices&quot; as developer commission. At the time, Apple was reportedly planning to appeal, but today, the Tribunal <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/apple-refused-permission-appeal-uk-ruling-app-store-commissions-2025-11-13/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">refused</a> to give the company permission to challenge its decision.&nbsp;</p><p>That means Apple&#39;s next recourse, if it wants to not pony up more than £1 billion in damages, is to take its case directly to the UK Court of Appeal. The company has requested 21 days to file any application with that judicial body.&nbsp;</p><p>It has been a busy year for Apple as it faces more regulatory pressure over its rules for the App Store and fees charged to mobile developers.

From video streaming services to budgeting apps, many services will have some Black Friday promotion you may be able to take advantage of. One of the best we&#39;re tracking is for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1c0b3a26-9b3b-4971-a5c7-65f04653d525&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Audible&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2h6L2F1ZGlibGUvYXJ5YS9tbHA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWMwYjNhMjYtOWIzYi00OTcxLWE1YzctNjVmMDQ2NTNkNTI1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2h6L2F1ZGlibGUvYXJ5YS9tbHAiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUQqCgpFbvc2l0aR-BpzSekE0S8jSztA3KGJbmbkPdew&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/arya/mlp?">Audible</a>. You can sign up and get your first three months for just $3 in total, plus get a $20 Audible credit on top of that.</p> 
<p>This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That&#39;s not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Audible has a diverse catalog that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audible-is-testing-book-recommendations-based-on-your-prime-video-habits-123053133.html">goes beyond audiobooks</a>. It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases. Users also get unlimited access to the Plus Catalog, which houses thousands of audiobooks. Finally, active members get discounts on many audiobooks when looking to purchase.</p> 
<p>Winter is coming and this is a good way to make sure you have plenty to listen to throughout the next three months. This deal does have a time limit. It expires on December 16.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-audible-deal-get-three-months-for-only-3-140010540.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a white elephant gift exchange at work this year or with friends and family, there’s a good chance you’re scrambling right now to find a good gift — or decipher what even makes a good white elephant gift. The possible origins of the term “white elephant” provide one way of looking at it: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>Whether or not that story is true, it gives us one way of looking at a white elephant gift: something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, there are plenty of other ways of interpreting this strange yet delightful tradition. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-white-elephant-faqs">White elephant FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-white-elephant">What is white elephant?</h3> 
<p>A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-does-white-elephant-work">How does white elephant work?</h3> 
<p>A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-it-called-white-elephant">Why is it called white elephant?</h3> 
<p>The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla may finally be capitulating to the calls of iPhone users wanting what practically every other major automaker offers them, Apple CarPlay. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/tesla-is-working-to-add-apple-carplay-in-bid-to-boost-vehicle-sales"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> is reporting that the EV giant is working to add Apple’s car infotainment integration to its vehicles, according to the outlet’s sources. The feature has reportedly begun internal testing and could be ready for release in the coming months. Of course, development and testing of the feature is not a guarantee that it sees the light of day.</p>
<p>An about-face of this magnitude would be truly surprising given Tesla’s years of steadfast commitment to its own infotainment solution, which doesn’t require connecting a smartphone. In the past, there has been a somewhat frosty relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the iPhone maker. Musk once said that he offered to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-apple-tesla-221149687.html"><ins>sell Tesla to Apple</ins></a> when the Model 3 program almost bankrupted the company, but said Tim Cook refused to take the meeting. Apple had also previously <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-tesla-director-of-autopilot-software-104848566.html"><ins>poached</ins></a> key Tesla employees for its failed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-car-project-is-reportedly-dead-203012885.html"><ins>Apple Car</ins></a> project.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla will reportedly be including CarPlay in a separate window within its existing software interface, ensuring it won’t be fully replacing the existing Tesla system. <em>Bloomberg</em> also reported that Tesla would be using the standard version of CarPlay, as opposed to the newer <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/apples-carplay-ultra-finally-arrives-but-its-exclusive-to-aston-martins-right-now-132516946.html"><ins>CarPlay Ultra</ins></a> that integrates with the vehicle’s instrument cluster.</p>
<p>This would be an interesting time to jump on the bandwagon as Apple CarPlay may be just past its peak. GM recently announced it would be phasing out support for both CarPlay and Android Auto in favor of a system <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html"><ins>built around Gemini</ins></a>, which seems to go directly against the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.autopacific.com/autopacific-insights/2025/7/24/autopacifics-newest-future-attribute-demand-study-fads-shows-increase-in-demand-for-autonomous-driving-and-adas-features"><ins>popularity</ins></a> of the platform. Ford&#39;s CEO recently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/786376/ford-jim-farley-apple-carplay-ultra-decoder"><ins>expressed disappointment</ins></a> in Apple&#39;s latest beefed up version of the tool.

<p>In iRobot&#39;s lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot&#39;s other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html"><ins>favorite budget robot vacuum</ins></a>, and you&#39;ll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it&#39;s down charging.</p> 
<p>This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results"><ins>its last earning statement</ins></a>. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac&#39;s offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/this-roomba-robot-vacuum-is-on-sale-for-only-150-for-black-friday-191506560.html?src=rss]]></description>

This was discovered by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5jkjanx6k2r">prolific news source and deals curator Wario64</a>, who also revealed a release date of December 4. The game will be free to play on both iOS and Android devices and will include the zombie-centric DLC <em>Undead Nightmare</em>.</p>

<p>That same leaker has also discovered an ESRB website with ratings for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S and the Switch 2. Rockstar&#39;s open world western <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/820086/netflix-red-dead-redemption-mobile-modern-console-update">is heading to current-gen platforms</a> on December 2.

<p>It&#39;s worth reiterating that this is the first <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> from 2010, and not the sequel. It&#39;s still a great game, despite not quite reaching the highs of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>.</p>
<p>This is just the latest team-up between Netflix and Rockstar. <em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-adding-the-gta-trilogy-to-its-games-library-on-december-14-190357966.html">became available on Android and iOS</a> for Netflix subscribers back in 2023.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my many hours playing <em>Vampire Survivors</em> I often wondered what it would feel like to have the absolutely insane bullet hell action extremely close to my eyeballs. Now my dream is being fulfilled, as there&#39;s a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://poncle.games/vr-faq">VR port for Meta Quest headsets</a>.</p>
<p>The appropriately-named <em>Vampire Survivors VR</em> costs $10 and is available for the Meta Quest 2, 3, 3S and Pro. This isn&#39;t a game that puts you in the middle of the action, as you won&#39;t have to duck and weave around the living room to avoid incoming hordes. Rather, it gives you a top-down view of the stage and you use a controller to navigate as you would on any other platform. This kind of tactic has worked in the past with VR titles like <em>Demeo</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="04742896c8774b948637fc04fe7ad0e4"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDAAEYBvq3E?si=khWpdiOhmwS2r8Sx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It can be played seated or standing, which isn&#39;t true of all VR games. Also, this is a standalone version and there&#39;s no cross-buy with other platforms. That means that save files don&#39;t carry over. That&#39;s a bummer, but I guess it makes sense given the uniqueness of VR. Developer Poncle has not revealed if this version will feature online co-op, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vampire-survivors-will-soon-offer-online-co-op-141430146.html">which was recently announced</a> as coming soon to the PC and console builds.</p>
<p>As for DLC, <em>Vampire Survivors VR</em> includes the base game and the <em>Legacy of the Moonspell </em>and <em>Tides of the Foscari</em> expansions. We don&#39;t have any information regarding the status of other expansions like the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vampire-survivors-is-getting-a-castlevania-expansion-but-still-no-vampires-143149407.html">cool Castlevania one</a> or the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-comes-to-vampire-survivors-in-the-form-of-a-free-expansion-183005013.html">utterly bizarre <em>Balatro</em> tie-in</a>.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors VR</em> is available right now, for those willing to risk a massive headache and perhaps a spot of nausea. Poncle currently has no plans to develop it for other VR platforms, like Steam VR or Pico.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/vampire-survivors-vr-asks-what-if-the-bullet-hell-was-on-your-face-190749256.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During Disney&#39;s latest earnings call, CEO Bob Iger spoke about next steps for the Disney+ streaming service, and he noted that the entertainment giant has had &quot;productive conversations&quot; with potential AI partners. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-plus-gen-ai-user-generated-content-1236426135/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, Disney+ might soon play host to user-generated short-form AI videos.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The other thing that we’re really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user generated content — mostly short-form — from others,&quot; Iger said.&nbsp;He didn’t specify which companies Disney has been in talks with or offer any particularly timeline for the arrival of gen-AI features.</p><p>There are already a bunch of ways for people to make and share AI slop videos, so this isn&#39;t a new concept he&#39;s touting. But it is a surprising direction for Disney, which has long been hawkish about protecting both its image and its IP. The company has already made legal moves against multiple different AI platforms, including a cease and desist sent to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Character.AI" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Character.AI</a></a> and copyright infringement lawsuits against <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-and-universal-studios-file-suit-against-midjourney-for-copyright-infringement-154206053.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Midjourney</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-warner-bros-discovery-and-universal-file-joint-lawsuit-against-generative-ai-app-hailuo-163819825.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Hailuo</a>. Iger said he hoped any partnership would &quot;reflect our need to protect the IP,&quot; and it would almost certainly be a lucrative deal for Disney. But even within the confines of its own platform, this is still quite an about-face for the company to now encourage gen-AI creations of familiar characters.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-may-start-hosting-user-generated-ai-videos-185000745.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been clear for some time that all is not well at Ubisoft.

Just before it was set to hold a call with investors on Thursday, Ubisoft said it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/13/3187667/0/en/Postponement-of-H1-FY2025-26-results-announcement.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">delaying</a> its half-year earnings report and halting trading of its shares. It has asked Euronext — the European stock market on which its shares are listed — to halt trading from November 14 until it publishes its earnings results &quot;in the coming days.&quot;</p><p>This could mean any number of things. Other companies have delayed earnings reports due to things like <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-finally-offers-233122126.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">accounting issues</a>. But halting trading of the company&#39;s shares could portend major news, such as a sale or Ubisoft becoming a private entity again. Engadget has contacted Ubisoft for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>It was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">reported late last year</a> that the founders of Ubisoft were looking to take the company private with the help of Tencent.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok introduced a new &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/introducing-bulletin-board?lang=en" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">bulletin board</a>&quot; feature for creators that allows them to blast out updates directly to their followers&#39; inboxes. The idea is similar to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-rolling-out-its-telegram-like-broadcast-channels-worldwide-160815133.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">broadcast channels</a> on Instagram or Telegram&#39;s one-way messaging feature.&nbsp;</p><p>People who opt to join a creator&#39;s bulletin board will receive updates in their TikTok inbox. Updates can include text, links, polls or photos; as well as other TikTok posts or lives. Followers who join a board can react to messages but won&#39;t be able to comment or reply like a typical DM or post. According to TikTok, the feature could be especially useful for musicians and artists, as it allows them to share new songs and give fans a way to &quot;pre-save&quot; an upcoming release.</p><p>For creators with a large following, having a bulletin board could help streamline their ability to interact with fans without having to wade through an overloaded inbox or post separate video updates. It also gives them a way to get their work (including links to non-TikTok content) in front of their biggest fans without relying on the whims of the app&#39;s recommendation algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bulletin Board is available now to all creators over the age of 18 with 50,000 or more followers. TikTok users can find and join bulletin boards on creators&#39; profiles.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktoks-new-bulletin-board-feature-lets-creators-send-updates-to-their-fans-inboxes-181000448.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>One of the many things that sets <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Quicken Simplifi</a> apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there&#39;s an option to say if you&#39;re expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn&#39;t offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it&#39;s not for you.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/quicken-simplifi-subscriptions-are-half-off-for-black-friday-160025840.html?src=rss]]></description>

I&#39;m a lifelong Lego lover, and my younger self would have squealed at some of the deals I&#39;m seeing — as I&#39;m betting is true for many of you. With so many to choose from, you&#39;ll be able to find one that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-tech-gifts-and-gadgets-for-2025-140052015.html">makes a great gift</a> for anyone who you know loves these little building bricks.</p> 
<p>Throughout the month, I&#39;ll be checking all the biggest online shopping centers in search of the biggest discounts on the best Lego sets available. We&#39;ve already seen low prices on Disney and Harry Potter advent calendars your kids will love this December, plus beautiful botanicals and art pieces for yourself or the adults on your list. It&#39;s only likely to get better, so keep checking regularly.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>In general, we always recommend using a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">price tracker</a> when determining if a Lego deal is in fact a good one.

<p>If you&#39;re a YouTube TV subscriber who relies on ESPN for football games, or maybe you never miss an episode of <em>Dancing with the Stars</em> (which airs on ABC), you&#39;re probably getting frustrated with the ongoing Disney feud. The two channels, along with other Disney-owned channels like Freeform and FX, have been <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html">off air since October 30</a>, which is just over two weeks.</p>
<p>While no resolution has been reached yet, the two large streaming companies are still negotiating the new pricing terms. One analyst has estimated that Disney is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-cfo-on-outube-tv-carriage-battle-1236616203/">losing upwards of $4 million per day</a> while the holdout continues. &quot;We’re ready to go as long as they want to,” <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-cfo-on-outube-tv-carriage-battle-1236616203/">said Disney&#39;s CFO Hugh Johnston on CNBC</a> while discussing the company&#39;s quarterly earnings. Disney, of course, is trying to maximize the fees it gets for its channels, while <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/">YouTube claims Disney is &quot;proposing costly economic terms,&quot;</a> which could result in higher subscription prices.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But there&#39;s good news: YouTube has made good on its promise to offer a $20 credit to subscribers — you should&#39;ve received an email from YouTube about it. However, it&#39;s not automatic so you&#39;ll need to claim it first — here&#39;s how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-your-20-credit-from-youtube-tv">How to get your $20 credit from YouTube TV</h2>
<p>YouTube TV already <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">costs you at least $83 a month</a>, so take advantage of the $20 credit while you can. Here&#39;s what you need to do.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open YouTube TV in a web browser and go to your Membership Settings in the upper-right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the bottom of the menu and click Updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Click &quot;Claim credit&quot; on the Updates screen.</p></li>
<li><p>You should see a confirmation screen showing you&#39;ve claimed the credit. It will be applied to your next bill, likely in December.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pause-or-cancel-youtube-tv">How to pause or cancel YouTube TV</h2>
<p>If the two can&#39;t reach an agreement, you may be looking to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129668">cancel your YouTube TV subscription</a> (or at least pause it until there&#39;s a resolution). Here&#39;s how to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open YouTube TV in a web browser and go to your Membership Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Membership.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Manage.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Cancel Membership, and then click Cancel to confirm.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the same settings, you can also pause your subscription until YouTube cuts a deal with Disney. Go to Settings &gt; Membership &gt; select the number of weeks you want to pause your subscription, and then click Pause.</p>
<p>That&#39;ll at least give you more time to decide whether it&#39;s worth keeping your account or closing it out.</p>

<p>Your $20 credit just goes to your next YouTube TV bill. But if you view that as &quot;$20 more to spend on streaming this month,&quot; you can put that budget towards some fairly straightforward workarounds, including ESPN&#39;s new standalone service, Fubo (a YouTube TV competitor) and several more.

<p>Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">one of the strongest in the category</a>. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we&#39;ve tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you&#39;ll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson&#39;s mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you&#39;re looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don&#39;t mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
