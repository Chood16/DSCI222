                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp just rolled out some upgrades to group chats. Perhaps the most interesting is the addition of member tags, which lets users give themselves a tag that&#39;s customized for a specific group.</p>
<p>Meta gives examples of a user assigning themself the role of a dad in one chat and a soccer goalkeeper in another. This could actually be pretty useful to people who use WhatsApp group chats to role play as characters, organize fantasy sports leagues and other stuff like that.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform is also rolling out text stickers to group chats. This lets users turn just about any word into a sticker via an integrated search engine. Folks can gather their most-used stickers together for easy access.</p>
<p>Finally, there are event reminders. This is fairly self-explanatory. The tool lets people create early reminders for upcoming events. Meta says that &quot;this helps everyone remember to commute to the party you&#39;re hosting or hop on the call at the right time.&quot;</p>
<p>This is just the latest WhatsApp update. The platform recently rolled out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/ai-powered-chat-summaries-are-coming-to-whatsapp-191201240.html"><ins>AI-powered chat summaries</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/whatsapp-is-bringing-back-its-very-first-feature-170100513.html"><ins>re-introduced away messages</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/whatsapp-upgrades-group-chats-with-member-tags-and-text-stickers-161420141.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CES is once again where TV manufacturers lay out their plans for the year ahead, and<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-las-vegas-153146838.html"> <ins>CES 2026</ins></a> is shaping up to be a showcase of both familiar rivalries and genuinely new display tech. While OLED and Mini LED remain central to most lineups,<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html"> <ins>Micro RGB</ins></a> has emerged as one of the most talked-about developments at the show so far, especially at the higher end of the market.</p>
<p>Below are the TV announcements that stood out most from the pre-show events and early press conferences, with more expected as CES continues.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-micro-rgb-tvs">Samsung Micro RGB TVs</h2>

<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p>
<p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1;slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2>
<p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p>
<p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p>
<p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1;slk:LG&#x002019;s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV;" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html">LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</a> makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p>
<p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2>
<p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p>
<p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p>
<p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2>
<p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p>
<p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2>
<p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p>
<p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p>
<p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p>
<p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-190929976.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-28-this-phone-powered-vision-test-can-replace-your-doctor.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Eye tests</a> are an important part of life, but they aren’t always the most convenient things to work into your schedule. It’s an issue Eyebot thinks it has solved with its kiosk, which shrinks the time taken from 20 minutes to closer to three minutes. Plus, you don’t need to book an appointment where an optician will lean too close in to your face while trial and error-ing corrective lenses. As mundane as a subject as a visit to the eye doctor is, this device could have some fairly massive ramifications. And, having tested it, I can certainly see the benefits.</p><p>Eyebot CEO Matthias Hofmann said that, despite the popularity of online glasses retailers like Warby Parker, 85 percent of Americans prefer to buy glasses in person. But accessibility is a big issue, especially in areas where there aren’t enough eye doctors to efficiently process tests. Hofmann added that this issue is far worse in rural areas, where people may need to drive for an hour or more to see an eye doctor, and then wait two weeks for their prescription to be filed.&nbsp; It’s these two maladies that Eyebot’s kiosk is meant to address, allowing people to walk up and complete their eye test whenever they want.</p><p>The test itself is very simple, you just walk up to the kiosk and let the big touchscreen walk you through the steps. You’ll answer some basic screening questions — this test is suitable for those aged 18 to 64 — and then complete a fairly perfunctory letter test. Once that’s done, you’ll be asked to stare at a picture of a hot air balloon (but not the picture you’re thinking of). All the while, two banks of three infrared cameras are scanning your eyes to create a 3D model of your retina and optic nerve. Once that’s done, you just need to share your email address and then wait for your prescription to be filed.</p><p>But you don’t need to worry that your eye health is being left to some algorithm making its best guess. Eyebot explained that each of its prescriptions are sent to an eye doctor working remotely who can look at the data the kiosk has generated, signing off on the prescription. Thankfully, I was able to compare this prescription with my last eye test (conducted by a professional) from the previous year, and found that Eyebot’s results matched it perfectly. It is worth noting, however, that Eyebot can’t run any medical tests; like the little puff of air blown onto your eyes to measure the pressure your eyes can withstand, which shows your risk of glaucoma. Consequently, while you can get your prescription with this process, you’ll still be advised to take regular visits to see a clinician. &nbsp;</p><p>Eyebot is presently operating in limited numbers in some Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in Pennsylvania, with plans to roll this out across the US in the near future. For the former, you’ll need to pay, while the latter comes as a benefit of your membership. Hofmann said that he envisages a future where there are Eyebot kiosks in shopping malls or at brick and mortar stores for online glasses retailers to grease the wheels of getting that fancy new pair of specs.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/eyebot-promises-an-accurate-eye-test-in-a-couple-of-minutes-160000668.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they&#39;re planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we&#39;re keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming tech at the show too.</p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here.

Micro RGB is a new tech that&#39;s similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren&#39;t quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can&#39;t be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer</a> for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.</p><p>We&#39;re seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>.

There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.</p><p>LG revealed its first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Micro RGB set</a> at CES as well.

The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months.

Dell revealed a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-unveils-a-massive-52-inch-6k-ultrawide-monitor-at-ces-2026-140024029.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor</a> (the first of those on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature in that it&#39;s possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and give each a dedicated section of the display — that could make co-op games pretty fun if you&#39;re dedicated enough to try that set up. It&#39;s possible to control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.</p><p>Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">Samsung</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">LG</a> revealed some new gaming monitors ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors.

The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.</p><p>Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/soundcores-nebula-p1i-portable-projector-launches-in-early-2026-for-369-160020321.html" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">announced the Nebula P1i</a>, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for camping trips too, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.</p><p>XGIMI was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xgimis-titan-noir-max-4k-projector-has-a-dynamic-iris-for-increased-contrast-170044625.html" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">also at CES</a> to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max.

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in.

PopuMusic is the company behind both.</p><p>Anker, meanwhile, has new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ankers-new-aerofit-2-earbuds-can-switch-between-open-ear-and-anc-form-factors-160014977.html" data-i13n="cpos:97;pos:1">AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds</a> that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear earbuds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. </p><p>Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ces-2026-shokz-new-earbuds-effectively-reduce-noise-while-keeping-your-ears-open-080000996.html" data-i13n="cpos:98;pos:1">Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds</a>, which have Dolby Atmos support.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CES 2026 isn&#39;t the first year we&#39;ve seen a wave of interesting robots or even useful robots crop up in Las Vegas. But it&#39;s the first year I can remember when there have been so many humanoid and humanoid-like robots performing actually useful tasks. Of those, Switchbot&#39;s Onero H1 has been one of the most intriguing robot helpers I&#39;ve seen on the show floor, especially because the company says that it will actually go on sale later this year (though it won&#39;t come cheap).&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, Chinese company Switchbot has been known for its robot vacuums and smart home devices. Much of that expertise is evident in Onero. The unexpectedly cute robot has a wheeled base that looks similar to the company&#39;s robot vacuums, but is also equipped with a set of articulated arms that can help it perform common household tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>I was able to see some of its abilities at Switchbot&#39;s CES booth, where Onero dutifully picked up individual articles of clothing from a couch, rolled over to a washing machine, opened the door, placed the items inside and closed the door. The robot moved a bit slowly; it took nearly two minutes for it to grab one piece of clothing and deposit it inside the appliance which was only a few feet away.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/N3rG4bQ0" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;m not sure if its slowness was a quirk of the poor CES Wi-Fi, a demo designed to maximize conference-goers attention or a genuine limitation of the robot. But I&#39;m not sure it matters all that much. The whole appeal of a chore robot is that it can take care of things when you&#39;re not around; if you come home to a load of laundry that&#39;s done, it&#39;s not that concerning if the robot took longer to complete the task than you would have. The laundry is done and you don&#39;t have to do it. That&#39;s the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Under the hood, Onero is powered by RealSense cameras and other sensors that help it learn its surroundings, as well as on-device AI models.</p><p>The demo of course only offered a very limited glimpse of Onero&#39;s potential capabilities. In a promotional video shared by Switchbot, the company suggests the robot can so much, much more: serve food and drinks, put dishes away, wash windows, fold clothes and complete a bunch of other — frankly, impressive — tasks. The Onero in the video also has an articulated hand with five fingers that gives it more dexterity than the claw-hand one I saw at CES. A Switchbot rep told me, though, that it plans to offer both versions when it does go on sale.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqLRDWNzzZ8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Which brings me to the most exciting part about watching Onero: the company is actually planning on selling it this year. A Switchbot rep confirmed to me it will be available to buy sometime in 2026, though it will likely be closer to the end of the year. The company hasn&#39;t settled on a final price, but I was told it will be &quot;less than $10,000.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While we don&#39;t know how much less, it&#39;s safe to say Onero won&#39;t come cheap. It also seems fair to say that this will be a very niche device compared to many of Switchbot&#39;s other products. But, if it can competently handle everything the company claims it can, then there&#39;s probably a lot of people and businesses that would be willing to pay.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lego’s Smart Play system</a> announced at CES 2026 earlier this week is a new embrace of digital technology that we haven’t seen from the company before. While the demo Lego gave at its press conference on Monday was a good start to showing what Smart Bricks are capable of, it really isn’t a substitute for seeing it in person. I was able to get an extended demo that answered many of my questions about how the system will work once Lego fans of all ages get their hands on the first Smart Play sets.</p><p>As I detailed yesterday, the Smart Play system contains three elements. The Smart Brick is packed with technology like proximity sensors, an accelerometer, color sensors and a speaker, all powered by a tiny chip. It’s crucial to know that each Smart Brick is identical at this point; to really bring a set to life, you need to combine it with Smart Tags or Smart Minifigures. Both the Tags and Minifigures contain specific instructions that help the Brick understand the context that it is placed in.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1b3ea456-d0b3-410e-85fe-cfe72f85a0de"/><p>The demo started out simply, with three small Lego builds: a car, a helicopter and a duck. Each of those builds had a unique Smart Tag that the Smart Brick uses to understand how it should respond to real-world stimulus. The car started making the sound of a revving engine, and when playing with it to drive it faster and more aggressively, the engine made more noise. Tilting the car would cause it to make some screeching sounds as if it was taking corners hard, and flipping it over would make the sound of a car wreck. </p><p>The Smart Brick can similarly sense what specific Smart Minifigures is near it and respond accordingly. Since the first three Smart Play sets are all based on Star Wars, it’s a little easier to explain how they interact with the Smart Brick. Take the Throne Room Duel &amp; A-Wing set — it includes Smart Minifigs for Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine, and there are also Smart Tags that correspond to various actions the characters can take. If you place a Smart Brick behind Palpatine’s throne, the classic “Imperial March” theme will ring out and Palpatine himself will chatter a bit. The Minifigures don’t actually say real words, but they can still embody their characters well enough. Vader, for example, offers his classic breathing sound and exclaim if he’s defeated in a light saber duel.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9106.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9106.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="Lego Smart Play Star Wars sets" data-uuid="dcd9d136-e716-4742-9b69-442548dea13c"/><figcaption>Lego Smart Play Star Wars sets</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>That duel is a clever part of this set. There are moveable mounts you can place Luke and Vader on, along with a Smart Brick. To complete the battle scene, a Smart Tag tells the brick to take on the characteristics necessary for a light saber battle. As such, when you place the Minifigures in the mount, you’ll hear the classic sound of a light saber humming to life. And if you move the characters around and crash them together, you’ll hear the sounds of battle. Finally, knocking a Minifigure off its spot will tell the brick associated with that character to make their trademark sound of defeat — in Vader’s case, that’s the iconic “noooooooo.” </p><p>The other two new Smart Play sets are Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter and Luke’s Red Five X-Wing — an ideal pair for some space-based dogfighting. The X-Wing shows off how good the Smart Brick is at handling multiple inputs. Adding it to the X-Wing will make sounds of the ship humming to life, thanks to the X-Wing-specific Smart Tile. Sit Luke in the cockpit and you’ll hear the Jedi theme music play, and seating R2-D2 in the back will make the Droid chatter at you in its familiar tones. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9065.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9065.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The Smart Tile is how the Smart Brick identifies this set as an X-Wing figher." data-uuid="ebb78d8a-6faa-4fbe-a854-cea4d690d4b7"/><figcaption>The Smart Tile is how the Smart Brick identifies this set as an X-Wing figher.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>Pitting the two ships against each other shows off more of the Smart Brick’s capabilities. Grabbing the ships and whooshing them through the air will make the Smart Brick play sounds that aren’t just generic engine noises — you can definitely hear the difference between the X-Wing and the TIE fighter. Each ship also has lasers you can activate, and if two kids are in the same room flying ships around and firing off lasers, you’ll hear the ships taking “damage” as well. Firing enough shots while aiming at another ship will eventually cause it to play some exploding sounds to indicate that it has gone up in flames — the Minifigures associated with the ship will also make sounds of dismay, as well. </p><p>At first glance, the sets themselves don’t feel wildly different than other smaller-scale Star Wars sets, but the people from the Lego Group giving the demo pointed out a few notable characteristics. The TIE fighter and X-Wing are both specifically designed to withstand more abuse from active play scenarios than the average Lego set, and they’re also specifically designed to fit will in a kid’s hand so they can run around and propel them through the air. The Throne Room set, meanwhile, has a detachable area where Luke and Vader can battle — you can remove and re-attach it to the throne area easily enough, but it’s good to separate it out for more aggressive light saber battles.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9086.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9086.jpg" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="Lego Smart Play Star Wars sets" data-uuid="9d449163-8d87-40cd-9b9c-7d87cd406058"/><figcaption>Lego Smart Play Star Wars sets</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>All told, I’m quite excited to see where Lego goes with its Smart Play system from here. Starting out with some simpler sets from a massive franchise like Star Wars is a logical way to introduce the system. There are obvious play scenarios that make perfect sense as a way to show off the Smart Brick. But I’m looking forward to a time when Lego starts selling tiles and Minifigures that can expand the capabilities of existing sets, whether they’re licensed or not. And the idea of smushing together Star Wars with some of the many other properties that Lego has access to (Jurassic World? DC or Marvel? Despicable Me or Bluey?) feels like just the kind of chaotic fun kids will love having.</p><p>That’s perhaps the most important point about Smart Play. While Lego has made major overtures for capturing the hearts and wallets of adult Lego fans, Smart Play is very clearly aimed at kids right now. There are no screens, apps or setup needed for Smart Play — it seems exceedingly easy to just pick up and start playing. Furthermore, Lego is using this technology to make Lego sets more interactive, something the company hopes will encourage more social play amongst kids. That’s a solid use of the technology packed into a Smart Brick if you ask me.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html?src=rss]]></description>

At CES 2026, that meant new flagship productivity machines, reconsidered gaming notebooks and solid incremental updates across several major lineups. While we’re still seeing embargoes lift and hands-on time on the show floor, the announcements below reflect the most significant laptops we’ve seen so far. Plus, the list will grow as more companies reveal details throughout January 6 and beyond.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable">Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6fe343d0-eb88-11f0-abbf-1a7759f06b4d" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6fe343d0-eb88-11f0-abbf-1a7759f06b4d" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable" data-uuid="beb0f133-d7fb-3658-a961-572fb88a4223"/><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Lenovo came prepared for CES 2026 with a ton of laptops — concepts, fully-formed designs and everything in betwee. The most striking concept was the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html" data-i13n="slk:Legion Pro Rollable;cpos:2;pos:1">Legion Pro Rollable</a>, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9. It’s the kind of idea that makes immediate sense for flight sims, racing games and open-world titles that benefit from ultrawide views, even if the mechanics felt a bit prototype-like up close.</p><p>Lenovo also showed the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html" data-i13n="slk:XD Rollable concept;cpos:3;pos:1">XD Rollable concept</a>, which takes a more familiar rollable approach, expanding a 13.3-inch OLED screen to 16 inches at the push of a button. The twist is that the “extra” display wraps around the back of the lid to create a world-facing surface for mirrored content or a secondary view.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-book6-series">Samsung Galaxy Book6 series</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/9dce55c0-eab9-11f0-bef9-b1978212f09b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/9dce55c0-eab9-11f0-bef9-b1978212f09b" style="height:1125px;width:2000px;" alt="New Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs." data-uuid="e8976874-d578-3ca0-bad9-05fbd3b90c83"/><figcaption>New Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Samsung announced the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy Book6 family at CES 2026</a>, introducing three new laptops built around Intel’s Panther Lake chips: the Galaxy Book6, Book6 Pro and Book6 Ultra. The focus this year is on slimmer designs, improved thermals and longer battery life, with Samsung claiming up to 30 hours of video playback on the Book6 Ultra and Pro.</p><p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book6 Ultra sits at the top of the lineup, with configurations offering up to Intel Core Ultra X9 processors, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, including RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 options. Samsung says the Ultra delivers up to 1.6x better CPU performance and 1.7x improved graphics compared with the previous Galaxy Book generation, helped by a wider vapor chamber and a new dual-path fan system for GPU cooling.</p><p>Both the Book6 Ultra and Book6 Pro feature upgraded 2,880 x 1,800 AMOLED 2X displays with touch support, adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz and peak brightness of up to 1,000 nits. The laptops are thinner than their predecessors, with the Ultra measuring 15.4mm thick and the Pro coming in at 11.9mm — and Samsung has added haptic trackpads across the series for the first time. Pricing and release dates have not yet been announced.</p><h2 id="jump-link-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo">ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits." data-uuid="3b80f798-cec6-305a-954f-3f36c7222243"/><figcaption>On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>ASUS brought its dual-screen design into the gaming space at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">ROG Zephyrus Duo</a>, a laptop that pairs two full-size 16-inch displays with high-end gaming hardware. Unlike productivity-focused dual-screen systems, the Zephyrus Duo is positioned as a hybrid machine designed to handle gaming, content creation and multitasking in a single portable setup.</p><p>Both 16-inch Nebula OLED panels support HDR with up to 1,100 nits of peak brightness, NVIDIA G-SYNC, stylus input and high color accuracy. Performance comes from Intel’s latest Core Ultra processors paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, up to an RTX 5090. While the system’s 135W power budget means it won’t match the raw performance of some single-screen gaming laptops, ASUS is clearly prioritizing versatility over maximum output.</p><p>The Zephyrus Duo includes a detachable wireless keyboard, a built-in kickstand and multiple usage modes, including stacked dual-screen layouts and drawing configurations. Despite weighing a whopping 6.28 pounds, ASUS has kept the chassis relatively slim at 0.77 inches and equipped it with a six-speaker system, vapor chamber cooling and a broad selection of ports including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1 and a full-size SD card slot. Pricing and availability have not yet been announced.</p><h2 id="jump-link-msi-stealth-16-ai">MSI Stealth 16 AI+</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/msi-raider-16-max.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/msi-raider-16-max.jpg" style="height:1062px;width:1600px;" alt="MSI&#39;s most powerful gaming laptop." data-uuid="4bf56ae4-fbf2-4fa3-9b3d-9a45f04249f2"/><figcaption>MSI&#39;s most powerful gaming laptop.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MSI</div></figure><p>MSI updated its Stealth lineup at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Stealth 16 AI+</a>, a gaming laptop designed to balance performance and portability. The system measures just 16.6mm thick, weighs under two kilograms and is equipped with NVIDIA RTX 50-series graphics alongside Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors.</p><p>Despite its slim profile, the Stealth 16 AI+ includes dual memory slots and dual SSD bays, giving it more upgrade flexibility than many thin gaming laptops. MSI is positioning it as a versatile machine for users who want gaming performance without the bulk typically associated with high-end hardware.</p><h2 id="jump-link-msi-crosshair-16-max-hx">MSI Crosshair 16 Max HX</h2><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Crosshair 16 Max HX</a> represents MSI’s more traditional gaming approach, pairing Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs. It sits below the company’s flagship Raider models but still targets players who want strong performance in a relatively streamlined chassis.</p><p>Buyers can opt for an optional QHD+ OLED display with a 165Hz refresh rate, adding sharper visuals and smoother motion for gaming and media. Alongside the Max HX, MSI also announced a Crosshair 16 HX variant, giving the Crosshair line a broader range of configurations aimed at mid-to-high-end gaming buyers.</p><h2 id="jump-link-hp-omnibook-ultra-14">HP OmniBook Ultra 14</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/omnibook-ultra-right-side-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/omnibook-ultra-right-side-2.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="HP claims the Omnibook Ultra 14 has passed 20 different MIL-STD 810H tests for things like extreme temperature and shock resistance." data-uuid="cb5ee58a-4970-3477-b25c-abfbc39ecf63"/><figcaption>HP claims the Omnibook Ultra 14 has passed 20 different MIL-STD 810H tests for things like extreme temperature and shock resistance.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>HP used CES 2026 to debut its new flagship consumer laptop, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-hp-omnibook-ultra-14-at-ces-2026-super-sleek-and-surprisingly-durable-170000330.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">OmniBook Ultra 14</a>. It’s a premium ultraportable built around an ultra-thin but durability-focused design. The laptop measures just 0.42 inches thick and weighs 2.8 pounds, yet HP says it passes 20 MIL-STD-810 tests for shock, drops and extreme temperatures. Rather than a traditional unibody chassis, HP uses a forge-stamped aluminum construction designed to improve strength and bend resistance.</p><p>The OmniBook Ultra 14 features a 3K OLED display and can be configured with up to 64GB of memory and 2TB of storage. Buyers can choose between Intel Core Ultra processors or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite, with the Snapdragon version offering a more powerful NPU rated at up to 85 TOPS for AI workloads. HP has also added a vapor chamber for the first time in an OmniBook to support sustained performance in such a slim chassis.</p><p>HP rounds things out with a large touchpad, quad speakers and three USB-C ports supporting Thunderbolt 4, DisplayPort 2.1 and fast charging. The OmniBook Ultra 14 is expected to go on sale later this month starting at $1,550.</p><h2 id="jump-link-hp-omen-max-16">HP Omen Max 16</h2><p>HP also refreshed its gaming lineup at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-hp-omnibook-ultra-14-at-ces-2026-super-sleek-and-surprisingly-durable-170000330.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Omen Max 16</a>, which the company describes as its most powerful 16-inch gaming laptop to date.

HP is positioning the laptop as the flagship of its Omen lineup, sitting above refreshed Omen 15 and Omen 16 models that target more mainstream gaming buyers.</p><p>Pricing and availability for the Omen Max 16 have not yet been announced, with HP expected to share more details later this year.</p><h2 id="jump-link-acer-swift-16-ai">Acer Swift 16 AI</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Acer_Swift_16_AI.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Acer_Swift_16_AI.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Promo photo of the Acer Swift 16 AI laptop" data-uuid="316175aa-d260-4828-bd31-66e5ba0071c2"/><figcaption>Promo photo of the Acer Swift 16 AI laptop</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>Acer expanded its flagship Swift lineup at CES 2026 with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/acer-goes-big-on-the-haptic-trackpad-for-ces-with-the-swift-16-ai-laptop-230000750.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Swift 16 AI</a>, a large-screen ultraportable that leans heavily into input innovation and display quality.

It can be configured with up to an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H processor and Intel Arc B390 graphics, with up to 32GB of memory and 2TB of storage. Despite the large display, the laptop measures just 14.9mm thick and weighs about 3.4 pounds.</p><p>Acer says the Swift 16 AI is part of the Copilot+ PC program, positioning it around on-device AI features alongside performance and portability.

Instead of simplifying its product offering, the rebranding only bewildered consumers and tech journalists alike, both of which had come to know the XPS lineup to be synonymous with quality. Now, Dell is getting back to its roots and coming out with a whole refreshed lineup of XPS laptops, including new XPS 13, XPS 14 and XPS 16 machines. Specific details for each model still remain under wraps, and there’s no word yet on when they will hit the market.</p><h2 id="jump-link-alienware-gaming-laptops">Alienware gaming laptops</h2><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-teases-new-super-slim-and-entry-level-gaming-laptops-at-ces-2026-033000700.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">Alienware used CES 2026 to tease a new ultra-slim gaming laptop</a> designed to sit below the company’s Area-51 flagships. The laptop measures roughly 17mm, or about 0.67 inches, thick and will be offered in both 14-inch and 16-inch sizes.</p><p>According to Alienware, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-16-area-51-review-a-fully-retooled-gaming-mothership-150000871.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">16-inch version</a> will feature NVIDIA discrete graphics paired with new, highly efficient CPUs. Rather than positioning it as a pure gaming machine, Alienware says the laptop is intended to balance gaming performance with creative work, productivity and everyday use.</p><p>Alienware has not shared pricing, availability or full specifications, and it remains unclear how the 14-inch and 16-inch models will differ beyond size.</p><p>Alienware also previewed a new entry-level gaming laptop aimed at expanding its reach to more budget-conscious players. While specs remain limited, the company says the system will deliver strong gaming performance at its most accessible price point yet.</p><p>Alienware suggests pricing should come in below the $1,199 starting price of the Alienware 16 Aurora, potentially making it the most affordable gaming laptop the brand currently offers.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Throne has rocked up to CES 2026 to show off its forthcoming <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/vivoos-toilet-computer-keeps-an-eye-on-your-hydration-030000209.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">toilet computer</a> which uses computer vision to study your poop. It hangs from the side of the bowl and has a camera and microphone to track bowel motions and urination and offer feedback. It was co-founded by (activity tracker) Whoop co-founder John Capodilupo, who explained the hardware is designed to understand what your base state is to be able to identify when you fall out of that pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capodilupo explained the hardware will look at how often you go, the texture and size of your motions, as well as the volume. The eventual aim is to be able to analyze your gut health, adding that as a GLP-1 user, that sort of data is vital to manage the symptoms of those drugs. The battery lasts for a month on a single charge but you won’t be forced to drag it out of the bathroom to re-juice it. The device ships with a 13 foot long USB-C power cable which should stretch long enough from your nearest outlet to the toilet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, we can’t talk to its efficacy but will certainly be looking to test this thing when it arrives at some point in February. Pre-orders are open, and it can currently be picked up for $340, plus a $6 per month membership.</p>

The first companies to receive deployments will be Hyundai, Boston Dynamics&#39; majority shareholder, and Google DeepMind, the firm’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-google-deepmind-form-new-ai-partnership/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">new AI partner</a>.</p><p>This final enterprise version of Atlas &quot;can perform a wide array of industrial tasks,&quot; according to Boston Dynamics, and is specifically designed with consistency and reliability in mind. Atlas can work autonomously, via a teleoperator or with &quot;a tablet steering interface,&quot; and the robot is both strong and durable. Boston Dynamics says Atlas has a reach of up to 7.5 feet, the ability to lift 110 pounds and can operate at temperatures ranging from minus 4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. &quot;This is the best robot we have ever built,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said in the Atlas announcement. &quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Boston Dynamics has been publicly demoing its work on humanoid robots since at least 2011, when <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-12-darpa-atlas.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">it first debuted Atlas</a> as a DARPA project.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-las-vegas-153146838.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026’s</a> first official show day kept the pace up with a mix of near-term gaming upgrades, ambitious new form factors and a few reminders that not every gadget needs to do everything. NVIDIA announced important gaming news, we caught up with Samsung’s tri-fold phone and Lenovo marched out an army of impressive looking gaming laptops and concept tech. Here are the biggest stories from January 6.</p><h2 id="jump-link-nvidia">NVIDIA</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/nvidia-gsync-pulsar.jpeg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/nvidia-gsync-pulsar.jpeg" style="height:973px;width:1600px;" alt="NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync Pulsar is the next evolution of its VRR technology." data-uuid="1a398532-3ebe-4d1c-b2a4-152709f83a26"/><figcaption>NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync Pulsar is the next evolution of its VRR technology.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>NVIDIA’s gaming updates focused on making motion look cleaner and boosting performance without forcing developers to rebuild everything from scratch.</p><p>The company introduced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-tech-can-minimize-motion-blur-for-gamers-140000058.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">G-Sync Pulsar</a>, a new display tech designed to reduce monitor-based motion blur by pulsing a screen’s backlight in sections rather than leaving it on continuously. NVIDIA says the approach gives pixels time to stabilize before they’re illuminated, which should make fast movement easier to track, particularly in esports.</p><p>The first Pulsar monitors are expected to come out starting January 7 from Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI, all which are 27-inch 1440p IPS panels with a 360Hz refresh rate and up to 500 nits peak HDR brightness. Pulsar models also support Ambient Adaptive Technology for automatic color temperature and brightness adjustment based on room lighting.</p><p>On the software side, NVIDIA announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">DLSS 4.5</a>, which adds a second-generation Transformer-based Super Resolution model the company says improves temporal stability, reduces ghosting and improves anti-aliasing. DLSS 4.5 also introduces Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, intended to push performance toward your display’s refresh rate, with NVIDIA positioning it around high-end targets like 4K 240Hz path tracing. The 2nd Gen Super Resolution Transformer model is available now for RTX GPUs, while Dynamic 6x Frame Generation is expected in spring 2026 for RTX 50-series cards, with support rolling out across hundreds of games via the NVIDIA app.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung">Samsung</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-lead.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-lead.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The Galaxy Z TriFold is the latest evolution in Samsung&#39;s growing lineup of fancy foldable phones." data-uuid="588f7df5-275c-4a51-a848-aef469c53324"/><figcaption>The Galaxy Z TriFold is the latest evolution in Samsung&#39;s growing lineup of fancy foldable phones.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold</a> was unveiled in Asia before the show, but this was our first opportunity to see the superphone in person. It looked, at first glance, like the kind of idea that comes with obvious compromises: more weight, more thickness and a bigger price tag. In person, the pitch becomes easier to understand.</p><p>The main draw is the 10-inch AMOLED display, which is a meaningful leap from the 8-inch inner screen on Samsung’s current book-style foldables. That extra real estate makes multitasking feel less cramped, and when paired with DeX, it starts to resemble a travel-friendly laptop alternative if you’re comfortable carrying a small keyboard and mouse. The TriFold’s 4:3 aspect ratio also helps for video and general productivity, with fewer awkward tradeoffs than the squarer inner screens Samsung has leaned on in recent generations.</p><p>Samsung appears to have put real effort into the mechanics, too. The device uses two hinges and a magnet system designed to make opening and closing feel intuitive, with built-in warnings if you try to unfold it the wrong way. The obvious downsides are still there, including the bulk and cost, and it’s not clear how much thinner future versions can get when the USB-C port is effectively the limiting factor. For now, the TriFold is on sale in South Korea, with US and broader North American availability and pricing still pending.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo">Lenovo</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Legion-Pro-rollable-lead.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Legion-Pro-rollable-lead.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="While it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept&#39;s screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across." data-uuid="83660727-0d44-4e79-96c8-0422b504fc34"/><figcaption>While it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept&#39;s screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Lenovo arrived with a stack of concepts and a few more concrete products, making it clear that the company is still treating CES as its main playground for experimental form factors.</p><p>The most striking concept was the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Legion Pro Rollable</a>, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9. It’s the kind of idea that makes immediate sense for flight sims, racing games and open-world titles that benefit from ultrawide views, even if the mechanics felt a bit prototype-like up close.</p><p>Lenovo also showed the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">XD Rollable concept</a>, which takes a more familiar rollable approach, expanding a 13.3-inch OLED screen to 16 inches at the push of a button. The twist is that the “extra” display wraps around the back of the lid to create a world-facing surface for mirrored content or a secondary view. It’s a clever way to avoid hiding unused panel real estate, even if the practical use cases still feel limited (maybe point-of-sale terminals?).</p><p>On the handheld front, Lenovo confirmed the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-reveals-a-steamos-variant-of-the-legion-go-2-at-ces-010000852.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Legion Go 2</a>, which will be powered by SteamOS and will arrive in June starting at $1,199. It keeps the same core hardware, including an 8.8-inch OLED 144Hz VRR display, detachable controllers, a kickstand and two configuration tiers based on Ryzen Z2 chips. The big change is swapping SteamOS in place of Windows, which should appeal to anyone who wants a more console-like experience, even if it remains a large device at 2.2 pounds.</p><p>For laptops headed to market, Lenovo introduced the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-7-auto-twist-wont-let-you-out-of-it-sight-010000913.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist</a>, a notebook with a motorized display that can follow you during calls and presentations using a 10MP webcam and onboard AI. It also supports Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, up to 32GB RAM and 2TB storage, plus a strong port selection, and Lenovo says it starts at $1,649 with availability planned for June.</p><p>Finally, Lenovo teased an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/lenovo-just-revealed-a-concept-for-ai-powered-smartglasses-at-ces-010057822.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">AI smart glasses concept</a> that looks more like normal eyewear than most show-floor prototypes. Lenovo says the glasses are designed for live translation, image recognition and notification summaries, with an eight-hour battery claim. As with many Lenovo concepts, there’s no firm timeline for a retail release.</p><h2 id="jump-link-pebble">Pebble</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lede.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lede.jpg" style="height:1012px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of two Pebble Round 2 units, one in silver, one in rose gold, side by side on a table." data-uuid="f07e49cb-7f20-4110-ae96-fb975354868a"/><figcaption>The Pebble Round 2 reboots a smartwatch classic.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>Pebble’s presence at CES this year felt like a counterpoint to the “more features, more sensors, more subscriptions” direction of other wearables.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-seeks-to-remedy-the-wearable-industrys-original-sin-170000834.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Pebble Round 2</a> aims to revive the brand’s original appeal: a lightweight watch that supplements your phone rather than trying to replace it. The new model uses a 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen that runs to the edge of the case, with Pebble claiming two weeks of battery life in the 8.1mm-thick watch. It also makes deliberate tradeoffs, skipping GPS, a speaker and an optical heart rate sensor to keep the device thin and focused.</p><p>Then there’s the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebbles-founder-might-be-just-the-right-person-to-make-an-ai-ring-170104222.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Pebble Index 01</a>, a simple AI ring built around a physical button you press to activate voice commands that you can use to ask questions, set reminders and the like. The pitch is reducing friction: no wake words, no gestures you have to get right every time. Pebble says the ring is water resistant and not rechargeable, instead using a sealed battery designed to last years depending on usage, with replacement handled when the battery is nearing the end of its life. It’s available for pre-order at an early bird price of $75, with shipping planned for May.</p><h2 id="jump-link-segway">Segway</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/bc715a50-e031-11f0-9bdb-be0ed2d0933b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/bc715a50-e031-11f0-9bdb-be0ed2d0933b" style="height:5796px;width:12881px;" alt="undefined" data-uuid="777ad56f-e6d5-3cd4-a90b-b0a1ac56be43"/><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Segway expanded its presence well beyond scooters with two very different pitches: smarter yard care and more tech-forward e-bikes.</p><p>Under its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/segways-navimow-brand-unveiled-a-new-line-of-robotic-lawn-mowers-at-ces-2026-130007014.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">Navimow brand</a>, Segway introduced a new lineup of robotic lawn mowers spanning multiple tiers, including the X4 Series for large yards up to 1.5 acres with AWD and dual cutting motors, plus the more mainstream i2 Series with AWD and LiDAR options. Segway says pre-orders for the i2 AWD and X4 models begin January 16, with pricing ranging from around $1,000 to $3,000 depending on configuration.</p><p>On the mobility side, Segway announced two new e-bikes, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Myon and Muxi</a>, along with an electric dirt bike called the Xaber 300. The headline is the company’s focus on sensor-driven ride smoothing, smart features like Find My integration and app-based controls, and tech meant to make starts, hills and traction feel more predictable. The Myon is available now for $2,000, while the Muxi is expected in March for $1,700.</p><h2 id="jump-link-meta">Meta</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/garmin_band_demo_.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/garmin_band_demo_.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Meta&#39;s neural band in Garmin&#39;s Unified Cabin at CES 2026." data-uuid="a3b56fe9-e502-4e5c-ac69-f5b88b4416a0"/><figcaption>Meta&#39;s neural band in Garmin&#39;s Unified Cabin at CES 2026.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-emg-wristband-is-moving-beyond-its-ar-glasses-120000503.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">Meta’s EMG wristband</a> (that’s short for “electromyography,” the ability to recognize and translate small finger and wrist gestures) is starting to look like more than a companion accessory for smart glasses. Meta showed how its wrist-based neural controller could be used beyond its own eyewear, including an early demo with Garmin inside a concept car cockpit. The interaction was still basic — swipe and pinch gestures to navigate apps on an infotainment screen — but the larger idea is hands-free control of vehicle functions over time.</p><p>Meta also highlighted research work exploring how EMG control could help people with conditions that limit hand mobility interact with smart home devices like speakers, blinds and thermostats. If day one of the show had a theme beyond AI, it was that companies are still willing to gamble on new shapes and inputs, and they can work as long as they feel practical and immediately useful.</p><h2 id="jump-link-razer">Razer</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Project_Madison.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Project_Madison.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Razer&#39;s concept immersive gaming chair with light strips along the head cushions is pictured in front of a desk in a rocky outdoor environment between large puddles" data-uuid="e09ea37d-79ec-469b-ac46-8deff59a2c24"/><figcaption>Razer&#39;s concept immersive gaming chair with light strips along the head cushions is pictured in front of a desk in a rocky outdoor environment between large puddles</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Razer’s day-one news was split between a full-blown immersion concept and a more grounded chair refresh.</p><p>The company’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-madison-concept-chair-has-reactive-lighting-immersive-audio-and-multi-zone-haptics-140000118.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">Project Madison</a> concept is a gaming chair designed as a multisensory rig, combining reactive lighting, spatial audio and multi-zone haptics to match on-screen action. It’s not a product you can buy, but it’s a clear statement about where Razer thinks the “setup” category could go.</p><p>Razer also showed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-motoko-is-a-concept-gaming-headset-that-doubles-as-an-ai-wearable-140000534.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">Project Motoko</a>, a concept headset meant to blur the line between gaming gear and an AI wearable. It includes cameras for real-time object and text recognition and is designed to work with multiple AI assistants, with Razer positioning it as a platform that could eventually ship first as a developer kit and later as a retail product.</p><h2 id="jump-link-birdbuddy">Birdbuddy</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bird_buddy.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bird_buddy.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Two new Birdbuddy smart bird feeders displayed at CES." data-uuid="5f2d9aaf-a481-471b-afc4-868d80a2171a"/><figcaption>Two new Birdbuddy smart bird feeders displayed at CES.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Birdbuddy added a feature that makes its smart feeders feel closer to a true nature companion: birdsong identification.

Birdbuddy also says the new models improve camera wake-up speed, use a more modular design for easier cleaning and protect the lens with Gorilla Glass since birds have a habit of pecking at it.</p><p>The Birdbuddy 2 is priced at $199 and is expected to ship pre-orders in February, with wider availability mid-2026, while the Birdbuddy 2 Mini costs $129 with pre-orders planned for summer.</p><h2 id="jump-link-agibot">Agibot</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/AGIBOT.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/AGIBOT.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="undefined" data-uuid="d79206e0-8f8c-34a5-8d18-44cbce5f0efd"/><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Humanoid robots are having another moment at CES this year, and Agibot’s demos leaned into movement, personality and practical service roles.</p><p>The company brought two robots, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/agibots-humanoid-robots-can-give-directions-and-learn-your-tiktok-dances-045049798.html" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">larger A2 and smaller X2</a>, both capable of walking around the floor, waving to attendees and dancing with surprising confidence. Agibot described the A2 as a potential hospitality helper for places like museums or conferences, while the X2 is framed more as an educational platform with slightly more human-like movement. Agibot also says its robots can learn actions from video, including training dance routines from TikTok clips, and the company plans to make its robots available in the US this year, though pricing and broader availability details weren’t shared.</p><p>Day one is in the books, but CES 2026 is far from over. With the show floor now fully open, expect more hands-ons, deeper dives and plenty of unexpected demos as the week continues, especially across laptops, wearables, mobility and smart home tech.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>French startup WheelMove demonstrated a compact motorized wheelchair add-on at CES 2026 that not only acts as a power-assist device, but can also lift up a chair&#39;s small front wheels so it can ride over rough terrain. The accessory upgrades a manual wheelchair with a 10-inch extra wheel and a 250W motor that can drive at up to six miles per hour (10 kilometers per hour) and handle slopes up to 10 percent, with a range of 15.5 miles (25km). The battery is swappable, too, so a person could pack an extra for a longer outing to avoid having to stop and recharge.&nbsp;</p><p>As the WheelMove team showed at its booth, the accessory can be attached to a wheelchair in a matter of seconds while seated, and its control panel can be strapped onto an armrest or even a bodypart. There are five speed options, which also work to keep the speed consistent when a person is traveling on a downslope. With the WheelMove attached, its creators say a manual wheelchair user can traverse rough and uneven surfaces — like cobblestones, grass and dirt paths — as well as ramps with far less effort than would normally be required. In some cases, it could open up travel in places that would otherwise be completely inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>The startup says it&#39;s worked with wheelchair users who have field tested the device for months ahead of its launch. It weighs less than eight kilograms (17.6 lbs) and packs up in a backpack. Pre-orders for the WheelMove have opened for buyers in France, where it&#39;s expected to ship later this year before expanding internationally. It costs roughly $6,000.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two key differences between the two options: Netflix is willing to pay $82 billion, but only for the Warner Bros., HBO and HBO Max divisions; Paramount Skydance&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-has-an-updated-warner-bros-discovery-bid-144348321.html"><ins>latest offer</ins></a> came in at $108 billion and is for all of WBD&#39;s assets, including CNN, HGTV, Food Network and many more.

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Paramount Skydance made <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0d85764d-4fa7-4514-8838-b36076c55171&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=three+separate+attempts&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEwLzIyL3diZC1yZWplY3RlZC10aHJlZS1wYXJhbW91bnQtb2ZmZXJzLXNvdXJjZXMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGQ4NTc2NGQtNGZhNy00NTE0LTg4MzgtYjM2MDc2YzU1MTcxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEwLzIyL3diZC1yZWplY3RlZC10aHJlZS1wYXJhbW91bnQtb2ZmZXJzLXNvdXJjZXMuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQn8FYSL3NBFMqcMJF7h6hkpOY5M_zDS0KohefS-Qjim&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F10%2F22%2Fwbd-rejected-three-paramount-offers-sources.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/wbd-rejected-three-paramount-offers-sources.html"><ins>three separate attempts</ins></a> to scoop up WBD before the company even opened the process up to other bidders. The third of those early offers was reportedly in the neighborhood of $24 per share, while this most recent hostile takeover stands at <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/deals-ma/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramount-amended-bid/"><ins>$30 per share</ins></a>.</p>
<p>But the WBD board has concerns. Among them, the extraordinary amount of debt required for Paramount, a studio with a market capitalization of just $14 billion, to take on an acquisition of this size. (Netflix&#39;s market cap is over $400 billion.) This comes despite Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, stepping in to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2041610/000110465925123497/tm2533570d15_ex99-1.htm"><ins>guarantee</ins></a> $40 billion worth of the needed financing. The board also points out that Netflix&#39;s offer is partially paid in the streaming giant&#39;s shares, which it says have the potential to provide further value in the future.</p>
<p>At this stage in negotiations, the board also claims opting to go with Paramount Skydance&#39;s offer would also result in WBD paying over $4 billion in termination fees.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest,&quot; the letter states. The merger with Netflix will still have to go before regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/warners-bros-discovery-board-urges-shareholders-to-reject-amended-paramount-bid-141513357.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even if you bring home as few bags as possible — using reusable bags, carrying purchases home with your own two hands — soft plastics sill accumulate. I certainly have a collection with one flimsy plastic sack filled with dozens or hundreds of others. I plan to do something with it… eventually. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there aren’t a ton of options for what to do with those soft plastics, as most recycling facilities can’t accept them. But no one likes seeing them end up in oceans and rivers and stuck up in trees. So I was excited to see the Clear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (CPC) at CES. It’s a pre-recycler for your home that turns hundreds of bags into a solid brick that’s easier to transport. Certain facilities can accept the bricks for recycling. </p>
<p>Clear Drop works with 95 percent of soft plastics, sucking up bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks, package wrap and cling film into its maw. It then compresses and heats the plastic to form a compact eight by twelve by four inch brick. I asked Matt Daly, Clear Drop’s head of product, what the compactor can’t take and I was told you can’t add ping pong balls, IV bags and camera film.&nbsp;Easy enough. </p>

<p>It was satisfying to see the little slot on the top gobble up the plastic bags Daly fed it. The Clear Drop wasn’t set to smash and heat at the show, but I was assured by another Clear Drop rep that any plastic smell produced during operation was minimal and the company performed safety tests to ensure the machine didn’t create any harmful emissions. </p>
<p>Daly said it would take about a month for most households to create a brick, which translates to around a 30 gallon trash bag full of other bags. Once that brick is created, it can be shipped to one of Clear Drop’s partner facilities and pre-paid USPS shipping envelops are included. They work with multiple US-based recycling facilities and do audits to ensure the bricks are actually being recycled. </p>
<p>Of course, I was a little disappointed the bricks couldn’t be tossed in my blue curbside bin, but Daly said they’re working to bring more recycling partners on board and the ultimate goal is to create an infrastructure that would eventually include municipal recycling. Shipping the bricks somewhere feels a little counterproductive, eco-wise. And the machine itself is not cheap. The price is split up over the course of two years, but it adds up to $1,400. </p>
<p>I’m happy to see someone somewhere is doing something to address a pretty clear problem. While it’s not perfect, this is probably the best household-level solution I’ve seen to that can ensure your bags don’t go down some sea turtle’s throat. </p>

<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>

It's already on sale for $30, which is a discount of $10. These are preorders, however, with shipments officially going out on January 20.</p> 
<p>The 45W charger includes a smart display that shows real-time data like power flow, temperature and charging status. It also features "fun animations to keep things cheerful." Anker says it can recognize what's being charged and automatically adjust certain metrics to ensure a longer battery lifespan.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="1f0c9e1aa28c4e6cb8e2f5b6045a4e14" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.anker.com/products/a121d-45w-usb-c-fast-charger-foldable-plug-compact?variant=46070529228950"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> 
<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout. If that doesn't work, it's <strong>WS24D5XT3DV9</strong>. We haven't gotten a chance to try this one yet, but it looks promising.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-new-45w-nano-charger-with-smart-display-from-ces-is-already-10-off-160707191.html?src=rss]]></description>

That brings it down to $299, which is the lowest price we&#39;ve seen it so far since its release last September.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8777a973cdd649d7baad1ad64ba44b43" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFL8PZ5?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The Series 11 is our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">best overall smartwatch</a> pick, and we gave it a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html">hands-on review</a>. We were impressed with the battery life, which lasted longer than the 24 hours it&#39;s rated for in our testing. We also liked how lightweight and thin the watch is. The 9.7mm thick case on the Series 11 ties the Series 10 for the thinnest Apple Watch so far.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Fitness and health tracking are the main appeals of an Apple Watch, and the Series 11 introduces sleep tracking and hypertension notifications. The sleep tracking was comfortable thanks to the watch&#39;s small form factor. The watch also added a new wrist flick gesture that lets you dismiss notifications, end calls and silence alarms or timers.</p> 
<p>The GPS + cellular model of the Series 11 is also $100 off, and it&#39;s the first Apple Watch to support 5G networks. It&#39;s not too often you see an Apple product for 25 percent off its retail price, so if you were in the market for a smart watch, and especially if you are an iPhone user, it&#39;s worth checking out.</p>

At CES, Klipsch announced the upcoming Atlas hi-fi series that includes wireless and both closed and semi-open back models. All three are expected to arrive this summer, but the company hasn’t announced pricing or many details on any of them just yet. However, I was able to listen to the Atlas HP-1, the wireless model with active noise cancelation (ANC). </p><p>Without going into specifics, Klipsch says the HP-1 is designed for both daily wear and travel. This is thanks to the combination of light weight, comfort and “standout” battery life. Inside, coaxial drivers provide the company’s warm signature sound profile. Third-party support for spatial audio and hearing compensation is also in the works. This concludes the info Klipsch announced this week. </p><p>After seeing the HP-1 in person at CES, I can tell you they look quite similar to Bowers &amp; Wilkins recent headphones designs. Klipsch has opted for wood accents on the outside of the ear cups, likely as a nod to <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c7c52499-bf60-4416-a828-a2ac1ba969e7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b12f6ceb-4be5-4f5f-9b8c-8f655579a77d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Klipsch+Audio+Technologies&amp;linkText=its+speaker+heritage&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbGlwc2NoLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90aGUtZml2ZXMtaWktcG93ZXJlZC1zcGVha2VycyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjEyZjZjZWItNGJlNS00ZjVmLTliOGMtOGY2NTU1NzlhNzdkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbGlwc2NoLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90aGUtZml2ZXMtaWktcG93ZXJlZC1zcGVha2VycyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfd0d_eaPFzYWBAVewgw1CrSys0SoL771nJCVaw9M5nE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klipsch.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-fives-ii-powered-speakers" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Klipsch Audio Technologies;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.klipsch.com/products/the-fives-ii-powered-speakers">its speaker heritage</a>.

Klipsch is demoing the headphones with lossless audio over USB-C, so it will be interesting to see what the audio is like in wireless mode. However, the company’s trademark warmth and deft tuning is immediately apparent, giving preference to highs and mids without overbearing bass. There’s ample low-end tone, but it compliments everything else and didn’t overpower in the Rage Against The Machine songs and other tracks I listened to. </p><p>It’s difficult to paint a comprehensive picture here since I wasn’t only really able to observe sound quality — and only for a short time. But the HP-1 is certainly a premium set of headphones that are comfy to wear (at least for the few minutes I wore them) and definitely sound good. The biggest downside will likely be price, which I expect to be at least $500. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/klipsch-atlas-hp-1-hands-on-a-return-to-hi-fi-headphones-at-ces-2026-130000415.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MTV <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/mtv-off-air-video-killed-radio-star-1236659461/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">shut down</a> its remaining 24/7 music channels in several countries, including the UK and Australia, at the end of 2025. The main MTV network shifted its focus to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-17-facebook-watch-the-real-world-mtv.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reality shows</a> long ago and it occasionally dips back into music with things like the Video Music Awards, but this shutdown felt like the end of an era. If you yearn for the days when MTV actually played music videos, though, you might be in luck. A developer who goes by the name of Flexasaurus Rex has paid tribute to the MTV of old with a web app that has several channels of non-stop streaming music.&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://wantmymtv.xyz/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">MTV Rewind</a> has 11 channels at the time of writing, including one that features videos from the original channel’s first day of existence in 1981. There’s a channel dedicated to <em>MTV Unplugged</em> performances, a rap-focused stream, one for each decade from the ‘70s to the ‘20s and (my personal faves) <em>120 Minutes</em> and <em>Headbangers Ball </em>options. MTV Rewind has so far pulled in more than 33,000 music videos. That’s over two months worth of music, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://loudwire.com/coder-built-mtv-rewind-videos-app/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Loudwire</em></a> notes.</p><p>&quot;MTV was a cultural institution that changed music, fashion and youth culture. Then they stopped showing music videos and became reality TV,” Flexasaurus Rex <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://farcaster.xyz/flexasaurusrex/0x4820b097" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">said</a>. “I felt a wave of sadness when the announcement hit. Nothing felt like it could fill that void. So I started coding. Built it in 48 hours: MTV Rewind.&quot;</p><p>Each channel plays videos in a random order and there’s a shuffle all option if you can’t decide which stream to watch. If a song isn’t hitting for you, just tap the skip button. There are some era-appropriate ads too. For instance, I hadn’t seen this one from the Got Milk? campaign before it popped up. It reminded me of the J. Walter Weatherman gag from <em>Arrested Development:</em></p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/82yZVB7IDlE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>The app’s database is powered by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://imvdb.com/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">IMVDb</a> (The Internet Music Video Database). The videos are all pulled from YouTube, one of the things that helped spell the demise of MTV’s 24/7 music channels. There wasn’t exactly a strong case for <em>Total Request Live</em> to stay on the air, for instance, when we have access to practically every music video ever at our fingertips.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of my favorite things about MTV Rewind is that it has a hit counter like the Geocities of old. So very ‘90s. In fact, the whole thing is rad. Tubular, some might say.&nbsp;</p><p>MTV Rewind isn’t associated with MTV or its parent company. However, it does use MTV’s name. Here’s hoping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/paramounts-strategy-of-purposeful-digital-rot-doesnt-even-make-sense-204613382.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Paramount’s</a> lawyers don’t crack down on this. It’s nice to have fun things on the internet.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8r-tXRLazs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/mtv-rewind-is-a-developers-tribute-to-247-music-video-channels-120000424.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Philips Hue has introduced a new software feature called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://hueblog.com/2026/01/07/spatialaware-philips-hue-announces-new-lighting-feature/">SpatialAware</a> at CES 2026 designed to ensure that all the lights in a space are in harmony with each other. Available exclusively for the Hue Bridge Pro, it takes into account each light point in a room and tailors the colors to ensure a natural representation. &quot;In a sunset scene, for example, the lights on one side of the room emit warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while the ceiling lights on the opposite side reflect darker shades,&quot; the company wrote on its blog. The new feature is set to launch in the spring of 2026.</p>
<p>To use the feature, you scan a room with your smartphone camera and use augmented reality to determine the positions of individual lights. A smart algorithm then ensures each light point is coordinated. Any lamps added after setup will be taken into account. Then, you use SpatialAware to select a scene like &quot;Lake Mist&quot; and activate the mode.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/d87134e0-ebae-11f0-b7e6-c9037e6c37f3" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/d87134e0-ebae-11f0-b7e6-c9037e6c37f3" style="height:843px;width:1500px;" alt="Philips Hue SpatialAware" data-uuid="ddd5646c-1479-393a-8987-0c02721814d2"><figcaption>Philips Hue room without SpatialAware</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Philips Hue</div></figure>
<p>In the example at top, the company shows how all the lights in a room are &quot;no linger mixed together in a colorful jumble [above] but are perfectly coordinated. The same applies, for example, to the gradient color transitions of corresponding products, where SpatialAware even takes the orientation into account.&quot;</p>
<p>Philips Hue also introduced a few other features. To start with, the company is adding support for migrating multiple Hue Bridges to a single Bridge Pro during the setup process. In addition, the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors will soon work with Apple Home. Users will also see live video with picture-in-picture mode on Apple TV and get real-time alerts on the Apple Home app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hue AI assistant has been updated so you can now creation automations based on natural language requests — for instance, &quot;wake me up at 6:45 AM every day except on Wednesdays.&quot; New AI assistant languages have been added (Dutch, German and Spanish) and the Hue app will start showing automations within the rooms and zones they&#39;re set to control, so you won&#39;t need to jump around in the app as much. All those new features are set to arrive in Q1 2026.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster.<br><br>I tried out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint&#39;s top competitors</a> in the hopes that I&#39;d be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-budgeting-apps-we-tested">Other budgeting apps we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-budgeting-apps">How we test budgeting apps</h2> 
<p>Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-budgeting-app-faqs">Budgeting app FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-plaid-and-how-does-it-work">What is Plaid and how does it work?</h3> 
<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p>

<p>When parent company Intuit <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intuit-is-closing-down-mint-its-popular-free-budget-tracking-app-054145229.html">announced</a> in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint&#39;s millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. &quot;Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,&quot; Mint wrote on its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/mint-app-news/intuit-credit-karma-welcomes-minters/">product blog</a>. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn&#39;t an exact replacement for Mint — so if you&#39;re still looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a>, you have some decent options.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone remembers the unique controllers that never quite made it. As third-party peripheral makers attempt to offer gamers something different to the likes of DualSense and Joy-Cons, they often have to go in a different direction. GameSir’s Swift Drive (apparently a working product name) is definitely that. And if you remember 1998’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogcon"><ins>JogCon</ins></a> for the PS1, there’s definitely some shared DNA.</p>
<p>It features a compact steering wheel at the center of an otherwise typical controller design. It’s also got force feedback, tech usually found in (full-size!) steering wheel controllers. GameSir says it has a “high precision” Hall Effect encoder built in for “ultra-accurate” steering.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/3db02270-eb5b-11f0-9fe7-e24c400fcfcb" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/3db02270-eb5b-11f0-9fe7-e24c400fcfcb" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="GameSir Swiftdrive hands-on at CES 2026" data-uuid="196ab6e4-d479-36f1-b4d4-fab7a3350235"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>

<p>You will be able to adjust the steering range from 30 to 1080 degrees, but you’d likely want to keep it high – it’s the entire point of this controller. GameSir has added Hall-effect sensors to its more typical joysticks and buttons, while each trigger has its own haptic motor to simulate wheel slip and braking. Several RGB lights across the top of the controller will even attempt to replicate your in-game RPMs, which is a cute touch.</p>
<div id="3718a9bbcc6a4ea390075861a98a2bcf"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCGWBtrjUIY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>On the show floor at CES, I drove a big rig in a demonstration area that was stripped down to wireframe ramps and curved surfaces. The force-feedback is powerful and it’s a surprisingly satisfying driving experience as I wheeled around, rotating the steering wheel with both thumbs. The steering wheel can also be customized with different plates. It felt like a miniaturized steering-wheel controller and would lock out when I oversteered or stopped. You may be concerned about battery life, but the controller should last 20-30 hours on a single charge.</p>
<p>A GameSir spokesperson said the controller is expected to go on sale later this year, but pricing has not yet been confirmed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-game-controller-has-a-force-feedback-steering-wheel-lodged-in-the-middle-034521141.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robot vacuum companies are once again out in full force at CES 2026, giving their devices a new set of intriguing — and sometimes unsettling — capabilities. This year, Chinese appliance maker Dreame is showing off a vacuum prototype with giant legs that can climb up and down an entire flight of stairs.</p><p>The concept, called the Cyber X, was previewed last year at IFA in Berlin. The vacuum sports a somewhat terrifying set of legs with rubber treads that allow it to autonomously navigate multi-story environments. While Dreame has previously shown off vacuums that can move up <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-x50-robot-vacuum-can-climb-stairs-200058312.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">smaller steps</a>, it says the Cyber X can climb stairs up to 25cm (9.8 inches) high and slopes up to 42 degrees. It can manage both straight and curved staircases, and can climb a flight of steps in 27 seconds, according to the company.</p><p>We got a chance to see the Cyber X and its stair-climbing abilities at Dreame’s CES booth, and the device was able to deftly crawl up and down a flight of stairs. The Cyber X didn’t use its “legs” to walk up the steps, though. Instead, it used the treads horizontally, moving a bit like a miniature, cleaning tank.</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/CrFGiQsa" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Interestingly, the actual vacuum is separate from the climbing apparatus. As you can see in the image below, the larger device with legs has an opening where the actual robot vacuum can dock inside and sit while the Cyber X climbs stairs. </p><p>That likely means the Cyber X isn’t able to clean the stairs themselves, though it does cleverly solve the problem of transporting the vacuum throughout multi-story environments. </p><p>In addition to its legs, the Cyber X’s vacuum also has a built-in water tank to support mopping abilities, and a laser-powered navigation system to help it maneuver up stairs and around other obstacles. It also has a braking system that allows it to stay stable on floors and stairs, even if the battery dies. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_cyber_x_and_base.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_cyber_x_and_base.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Dreame&#39;s Cyber X." data-uuid="8a324934-df10-4c2c-b2ab-0b05c9d1562d"><figcaption>Dreame&#39;s Cyber X.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>For now, Dreame says Cyber X is just a research prototype and hasn&#39;t indicated if it plans to make it, or a robo vac like it, more widely available at some point in the future. But Dreame has a history of showing off innovative features at CES ahead of an actual release.

The X60 Max Ultra, which costs $1,699, can move over stairs up to 8.8cm (about 3.4 inches), a small improvement over last year&#39;s X50, which could clear heights of 6cm (about 2.4 inches). That&#39;s not enough to manage a full-size stair, which is typically around 7 inches, but it should make the X60 flexible enough to navigate threshold steps and other small obstacles.</p><p><strong>Update, January 6, 2026, 5:07PM PT:</strong> This post was updated with new photos and video and to add additional information about the Cyber X after seeing a live demonstration at Dreame’s CES booth. <br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/dreames-latest-robot-vacuum-concept-has-slightly-terrifying-legs-that-can-climb-full-size-stairs-210000399.html?src=rss]]></description>

The appropriately-named Lenovo AI Glasses Concept promises to transform &quot;how users interact with their surroundings and unifies their workflow.&quot;</p>
<p>They look like a standard pair of specs and not all that different from something like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html">Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>. A pair weighs just 45 grams and the battery lasts eight hours, which is just enough time to get through a standard workday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The glasses are wirelessly tethered to a smart device, which is what does most of the computational heavy lifting. They do include Lenovo and Motorola&#39;s proprietary AI platform called Qira, which delivers &quot;sub-millisecond live translation and intelligent image recognition.&quot; There&#39;s also something called the Catch Me Up feature, which is an AI-generated recap of various notifications from various devices.</p>
<p>The hardware allows for touch and voice control and includes teleprompter software. The concept glasses include speakers, as Lenovo is advertising music playback as a feature.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know when or if these smart glasses will ever hit store shelves.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lenovo has brought a slew of updates to its Legion and LOQ line of gaming laptops for CES 2026. The refreshed laptops are all built around Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>
<p>The new Legion 7a is both thinner and lighter than the previous generation and is aimed at gamers, creators, and working professionals. Lenovo says the new 7a will be powered by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-ai-400-chips-are-a-big-boost-for-laptops-and-desktops-alike-033000635.html"><ins>AMD Ryzen AI 400 CPUs</ins></a> and RTX 50-series GPUs, delivering up to 125W of total system power.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Presumably this means buyers will choose from multiple CPU and GPU configurations, and Lenovo says the 7a will support up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 and up to an RTX 5060 GPU, but precise details on other configurations have not been made available.</p>
<p>The laptop sports a 16-inch OLED display and Lenovo says the laptop&#39;s &quot;AI-optimized&quot; performance is ready to handle complex coding, simulation, and 3D modeling projects. The 7a runs on Windows 11 Copilot+ and uses on-board software to dynamically tune power use and thermals depending on the workload the laptop is under. The Legion 7a will start at $2,000, with availability &quot;expected&quot; in April.</p>
<p>Lenovo is also refreshing the Legion 5 line with the Legion 5i powered by the new <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html"><ins>Intel Core Ultra Series 3</ins></a> and Legion 5a with a choice of an AMD Ryzen AI 400 or Ryzen 200. Both will offer RTX 50-series GPUs, OLED displays and the same software-based tuning features as the 7a. Lenovo says the 5i can be figured up to an Intel Ultra 9 386H with an RTX 5060 GPU, and the 5a up to a Ryzen AI 9 465 with RTX 5060. Here again we don&#39;t yet have details on alternate configurations.</p>
<p>The Legion 5 laptops run on Windows 11 Copilot+, and Lenovo says they are ready for gaming, streaming, building presentations and video editing. Pricing starts at $1,550 for the 5i, $1,500 for the 5a with Ryzen AI 400 and $1,300 for the 5a with Ryzen 200. Lenovo also expects these laptops to be available in April.</p>
<p>At the entry level, the LOQ 15AHP11 and LOQ 15IPH11 target students with RTX 50-series graphics and a WQXGA (2560 x 1600) LCD display up to 15.3 inches. The 15AHP11 will start from $1,150 with availability expected in April, while the 15IPH11 will not be sold in the US.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-updates-its-legion-and-loq-gaming-laptops-for-ces-010042509.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Motorola just announced its very first side-foldable smartphone, joining the ranks of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-tankiest-foldable-170051471.html">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. The Razr Fold boasts an impressive 6.6-inch external screen and an 8.1-inch flexible main display. The company hasn&#39;t provided dimensions, so we don&#39;t know how thick it is.</p>
<p>We do know, however, that it&#39;ll include support for the Moto Pen Ultra stylus. This is actually a fairly big deal, as Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/unpacked-2025-s-pen-shocker-galaxy-z-fold-7-loses-compatibility-with-stylus">dropped the feature for the Z Fold 7</a>. Modern foldables basically double as tablets, so a stylus is always appreciated.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a robust camera system here, with a 50MP Sony sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro, a 50MP telephoto, a 32MP external selfie lens and a 20MP internal camera. It also offers the ability to record in Dolby Vision.</p>
<p>The Razr Fold will be available in blue and white. We don&#39;t have any information regarding internal specs, pricing or availability. Motorola says that &quot;more specifications will be shared in the coming months.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that while this is the company&#39;s first side-folding camera, Motorola has always made top-folding phones. After all, that&#39;s what a flip phone is. The company continues to refine this basic idea with its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html">standard Razr line</a> of midrange top-folding smartphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-just-announced-a-foldable-phone-to-rival-samsung-and-google-at-ces-010015323.html?src=rss]]></description>

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition and ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Gen 11 Aura Edition come with a new design the company has dubbed “Space Frame.” </p><p>Lenovo calls Space Frame an “engineering breakthrough” and describes it as a design that restructures the interior of a laptop, so that components are placed on both sides of the motherboard. This structure improves the computer’s cooling and, hence, enables higher sustained performance. It comes with replaceable USB ports, battery, keyboard speakers and fans for easier repairs, and it also gives Lenovo enough room to equip laptops with a larger haptic touchpad.</p><p>In addition to having the Space Frame design, both ThinkPad X1 Carbon and X1 2-in-1 Aura Editions are Microsoft Copilot+ PCs powered by the new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Intel Core Ultra X7 Series 3 processors,</a> which also debuted at CES. The processors ship with 12Xe graphic cores and integrated NPUs for AI acceleration. Both models also introduce  a new 10MP camera with a 110-degree-wide field of view that features advanced distortion correction. As for the ThinkPad X1 2-in-1, it ships with a new magnetically docked pen that was designed to be ergonomic. </p><p>The company has announced the ThinkPad X9 15p Aura Edition at the event, as well. It’s a follow-up to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">last year’s X9</a> with an all-aluminum chassis, making it an alternative to Apple’s MacBooks. This model comes with a 15.3-inch 2.8K OLED display and ThinkPad’s largest haptic touchpad, and it’s powered by the new Intel Core Ultra X9 Series 3 processors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-14th-gen-thinkpad-x1-carbon-comes-with-a-new-space-frame-design-010000262.html?src=rss]]></description>

But at least now it&#39;s official. At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company revealed the Legion Go 2, Powered by SteamOS. The Valve-friendly variant of the gaming handheld arrives in June, starting at a pricey $1,199.</p><p>There aren&#39;t any surprises here. It&#39;s the same Lenovo Legion Go 2 hardware, with SteamOS replacing the sometimes-awkward Windows. In many ways, you could view the SteamOS Legion Go 2 as a more powerful and versatile (and expensive!) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam Deck</a>. One notable exception is the optimizations game developers often make for Valve&#39;s handheld. (Ditto for &quot;Steam Deck Verified&quot; badges on store listings to learn quickly how playable games are.)</p><p>So, all the specs from the Windows version carry over. That includes a spacious 8.8-inch OLED display at 1,920 x 1,200 and with a 144Hz VRR. You still have two tiers to choose from: Ryzen Z2 / 16GB  / 1TB or Ryzen Z2 Extreme / 32GB / 2TB. The device has a microSD slot, kickstand, detachable controllers and a 74Wh battery. At 2.2 lbs, it&#39;s a bulky affair, so you&#39;ll want to look elsewhere if a light, compact handheld is your priority.</p><p>Lenovo says the Legion Go 2, Powered by SteamOS is expected in June. It will start at $1,199 for the entry-level variant. (Lenovo hasn&#39;t yet announced pricing for the Z2 Extreme tier.)

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A couple years ago Lenovo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-auto-twist-concept-laptop-has-a-lid-that-can-swivel-and-bow-down-at-your-command-150022971.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">showed off a concept laptop stand</a> that used cameras and AI to follow you around. But now at CES 2026, the company has taken that idea and turned it into a full-fledged system that it’s actually going to sell.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubbed the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist, instead of a laptop stand, Lenovo created a standalone notebook with the same functionality, plus a little more. The impressive thing is that despite having a built-in motor that lets its display follow you around, the laptop’s design doesn&#39;t look all that outlandish. And after playing around with it a bit, I discovered a handful of other tricks it can do.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2LFxh30Xo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Instead of using your fingers to open the lid like a luddite, all you have to do is knock a couple times and then the laptop’s display will pop up by itself. From there, you’re greeted with a surprisingly good-looking 14-inch 2.8K OLED display and a traditional keyboard that won’t upset longtime ThinkBook or ThinkPad aficionados. You also get solid specs including support for Intel’s new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, up to 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage and a decently large 75Whr battery. The laptop also sports a strong selection of ports including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, a full-size HDMI jack and Wi-Fi 7. And all of this comes in a chassis that weighs 3.1 pounds, which is very reasonable for a 14-inch machine.&nbsp;</p><p>As for its auto-twisting abilities, the main use case is during presentation and video calls, where the laptop can use its motor, 10-MP webcam and AI to track your face as you move around so you stay neatly in frame. Compared to the concept I saw before, the laptop pivots and rotates its display more smoothly (though it’s still a bit jerky) and if you want, you can even make it dance to music. Alternatively, the laptop can analyze your posture to position its screen in the optimal position to prevent slouching or automatically transform between laptop, tablet and presentation modes. While this is a really minor inclusion, my favorite thing about the Auto Twist is that when you turn the system off, the laptop will automatically close its own lid, as if it was tucking itself into bed.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6aa8e884-d5ee-41d7-bfc3-315af0af150f"/><p>The other goal of this laptop is that Lenovo is touting it as a vertical AI solution for small businesses. Naturally this means that the system supports Microsoft’s Copilot+ features, though we also saw a demo of Lenovo’s own AI companion. Not only can you talk to it, ask it questions or use it to translate other languages like a regular digital assistant, the company created a friendly face that reacts to your queries and comments.&nbsp;</p><p>The one odd inclusion, which probably won’t make it to retail units, was an AI feature designed to help you understand hidden meanings or subtext in other languages. However, in my experience (as seen in the video above), this turned into a weird excuse to get negged by AI or at the very least make yourself more paranoid about what your friends or coworkers are saying about you.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/auto-twist-lid-twisted.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/auto-twist-lid-twisted.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="My favorite thing about the Auto Twist is that if you shut it down, it will automatically close its own lid. " data-uuid="f8008873-f8d9-4e60-8d24-c1a84ce0f99f"><figcaption>My favorite thing about the Auto Twist is that if you shut it down, it will automatically close its own lid. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>In the end, I’m still not sure I need a laptop with a display and a camera that can follow me around during video calls. But if you have happy feet during work meetings or like to express yourself through movement, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist might be the business notebook you need. Plus, considering it features relatively novel tech, its starting price of $1,649 is surprisingly approachable. You’ll just have to wait until it goes on sale sometime in June.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-7-auto-twist-wont-let-you-out-of-it-sight-010000913.html?src=rss]]></description>

At CES 2026, the company is announcing a sequel to its tracker, the Moto Tag 2, a stylus for its new folding phone, the Moto Pen Ultra and a more premium smartwatch called the Moto Watch.</p><p>The Moto Watch has a 47mm round face with a stainless steel crown and an aluminum frame. The smartwatch comes with a PANTONE &quot;Volcanic Ash&quot; silicone band, but is designed to support third-party 22mm bands, too, which greatly expands its customization options. Motorola says the watch can get up to 13 days of battery life normally or seven days with its always-on display enabled, and also features a built-in speaker and microphone for hands-free controls and audio notifications. The Moto Watch is meant to be fairly durable, as well, with Gorilla Glass 3 front glass and IP68 water and dust resistance.</p><p>The actual fitness features of the watch are powered by Motorola&#39;s new partner Polar, a company with its own line of fitness trackers and smartwatches. The Moto Watch lets users log their calorie consumption throughout the day, track their workouts and activity levels (with a daily Activity Goal and Activity Score) and monitor their sleep. The watch also has built-in dual-frequency GPS for tracking runs, bike rides and hikes.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Motorola-Moto-Pen-Ultra.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Motorola-Moto-Pen-Ultra.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A hand holding a Moto Pen Ultra writing on a Razr Fold." data-uuid="6ca15c61-76c8-4b0c-b2a4-db8c356cae1c"/><figcaption>A hand holding a Moto Pen Ultra writing on a Razr Fold.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Motorola</div></figure><p>While Samsung dropped S Pen stylus support on its latest version of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (one of many ways the company got the foldable so thin), Motorola is embracing styluses on its new Razr Fold. The Moto Pen Ultra comes with a charging case and supports things like palm rejection and tilt sensitivity for more accurate strokes. The Moto Pen Ultra can also be used with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/circle-to-search-now-offers-one-tap-actions-for-phone-numbers-emails-and-urls-180005330.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Google&#39;s Circle to Search</a> and new AI-powered software features like &quot;Sketch to Image,&quot; which converts hand-drawn sketches into detailed images.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Moto-Tag-2-bike.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Moto-Tag-2-bike.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A bike seat with a Moto Tag 2 attached to it." data-uuid="376a5a42-4feb-42c9-8999-cbb2de5c257d"/><figcaption>A bike seat with a Moto Tag 2 attached to it.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Motorola</div></figure><p>The Moto Tag 2 builds on the original Moto Tag with a longer battery life and better durability. The Moto Tag 2 is IP68-rated and now gets over 500 days of battery life in comparison to the original Tag&#39;s year-long battery. As before, the Bluetooth tracker connects to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-improving-scam-detection-and-its-find-feature-on-android-170037324.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Google&#39;s Find Hub</a> network and Motorola says the tracker&#39;s ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna and support for Bluetooth Channel Sounding can help users determine the exact distance they are from their tracked object. You can also press the button on the Moto Tag 2 to ring your phone if it&#39;s missing, or customize the Tag to act as a camera shutter button.</p><p>Motorola hasn&#39;t shared pricing details for any of its new Moto Things accessories, though it has provided a release date for at least one. The Moto Watch will be available on January 22 from the company&#39;s website. The Moto Tag 2 and Moto Pen Ultra, meanwhile, will both be available in North America &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-expands-its-moto-things-lineup-with-a-new-bluetooth-tracker-stylus-and-smartwatch-010000669.html?src=rss]]></description>

On Tuesday evening, the company announced Qira, a cross-device AI for both its own computers and Motorola smartphones. Set to arrive later this quarter, it will live at the system level of Lenovo devices. Users won&#39;t need to open or switch to the assistant. Instead, &quot;it&#39;s always present,&quot; says Lenovo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you can ignore Qira, and it will stay quiet if you don&#39;t need the software to do anything for you. Occasionally, Lenovo says Qira will surface proactive suggestions, and for frequent users, the company promises a machine learning system that will develop a &quot;living model&quot; of your world, &quot;understanding context, continuity and personal patterns of over time.&quot; In practice, that means Qira can write emails for you, transcribe and translate meetings and provide summaries of things you might have missed. You know, all the usual stuff every company is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-essential-spaces-ai-powered-app-done-right-163042976.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">offering with their on-device assistants</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From a privacy standpoint, Lenovo says Qira employs a hybrid architecture that &quot;prioritizes&quot; on-device processing, and won&#39;t collect customer data without the user&#39;s permission.&nbsp;&quot;Every aspect of the Lenovo Qira experience is designed to be secure, ethical, and accountable.&quot; I asked Lenovo how Qira would interact with Copilot and Gemini on the company&#39;s PCs and Motorola smartphones, and if the new assistant would add to the processing load on those devices, but the company has yet to respond to my email. I&#39;ll update this article when I hear back.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, creating a dedicated AI assistant for the company&#39;s devices is something I&#39;m sure Lenovo executives agreed was a good idea, but when many people aren&#39;t even using Copilot, it feels like a misread of what Lenovo users want. In April, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/microsofts-big-ai-hire-cant-match" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reporting from <em>Newcomer</em></a><em> </em>suggested Copilot had flatlined at around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">20 million weekly users</a> in 2024.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Lenovo has experimented more with laptops featuring rollable displays than pretty much any other PC maker and at CES 2026 it’s keeping that trend going with the XD Rollable Concept.</p><p>Equipped with a 180-degree Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover, the XD Rollable concept features a very futuristic design. However, underneath, it has the same basic engineering as last year’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6.</a> That means with the touch of a button, its 13.3-inch flexible OLED display can expand to 16 inches, which gives you around 50 percent extra screen space in just a few seconds. The main difference with Lenovo’s latest concept is that instead of hiding the unused section of its rollable display underneath its keyboard, the XD’s panel wraps up and over its lid to create a “world-facing” display around back. This allows people sitting on the other side of the laptop to see content, with the laptop capable of mirroring elements from its main display or using that space as a small secondary monitor.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kswd5I_trbc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Now I will admit that after seeing the XD Rollable in person, its design does feel a bit gimmicky. Even though Lenovo’s space-themed animation that appears when the laptop’s display extends is pretty slick, I’m not sure how helpful that world-facing display really is. In normal use, you can’t even see it because it’s on the other side of the lid and while I suppose you could utilize that area for meetings or presentations, I think most people would be much better off simply connecting the notebook to a dedicated secondary monitor or projector.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="36d6ee06-e8a6-4dc9-9a89-3befeba89c7e"/><p>That said, I do like that contrary to the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, by exposing the unused part of the XD Rollable’s display when it’s not extended, you get a little bit of extra value out of it. At the very least, it beats stashing the rest of the panel underneath the keyboard where it won’t be seen at all. On top of that, I like the look of having no bezel along the top of the display and you can even use touch controls on the edge of the display to control widgets or expand its flexible screen. Interestingly, the coolest part about the XD Rollable might not even be its screen, but the motors and rails that Lenovo uses to extend its display, which are easily seen beneath its glass design.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the XD Rollable is very down to earth with it featuring a comfy keyboard and a decent-sized touchpad. The main downsides are that its glass lid makes the concept a bit heavier than a more traditional 13-inch notebook and you only get two USB-C ports. But considering that Lenovo isn’t planning to put this thing into production, that lack of connectivity or info regarding its specs shouldn’t come as a big surprise.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lenovo might have the most concept devices of any company at CES 2026, but the wildest and most interesting one is almost certainly the Legion Pro Rollable which features a 16-inch flexible display that can expand to not one but two different sizes.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the Legion Pro Rollable, Lenovo started out with a standard <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-ces-2025-the-10th-gen-legion-pro-7i-gaming-laptop-supports-up-to-rtx-5090-graphics-160004703.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Legion Pro 7i</a> and kept the bottom half including all of its ports and support for an RTX 5090 GPU. But then the company went a bit crazy: Instead of replacing the notebook’s original 16-inch OLED screen with a rollable variant that extends upwards like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Thinkbook Plus Gen 6</a> from 2025, Lenovo opted for one that expands outwards to either 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches This means instead of being restricted to a standard 16:10 aspect ratio, you also have the choice of 21:9 or an ultra-wide 24:9 with just the touch of a button. Or more like two buttons because to widen or shrink its display, you need to press FN plus one of its arrow keys.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept goes wide and wiiiider. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/R5fJ0vU3NX">pic.twitter.com/R5fJ0vU3NX</a></p>— Sam Rutherford (@samrutherford) <a href="https://twitter.com/samrutherford/status/2008706297118761202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p>Admittedly that feels a bit clunky considering some of Lenovo’s other laptops with expandable displays have a dedicated button. But this is a concept device after all, which was immediately obvious when I got a chance to see this up close. The bottom of the laptop feels solid, as you’d probably expect because not much has changed there. However, the top of the laptop didn’t feel super sturdy, probably due to the display’s hinge not being able to fully support a heavier lid and the notebook’s bulkier rollable display.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="edb91ca6-76a5-410a-be3b-1728f1d796a5"/><p>I also noticed that there were some faint lines left by the internal motors that allow the rollable display to do its thing and a bit of waviness from the panel due to it not being super taut. That said, from the side, I was impressed that even for a prototype, Lenovo did a halfway decent job of eliminating any huge panel gaps or empty spaces where the lid expands. The biggest bummer is that even though Lenovo had a handful of demo units on on site, there weren’t any games installed so I wasn’t able see the Legion Pro Rollable’s tech function in full glory.&nbsp;</p><p>But if we’re being honest, none of that really matters on a gadget that’s meant to be a showcase and testbed for next-gen tech. The idea of a gaming laptop with a screen that can go from normal to ultra-wide at the touch of a button (or buttons) is super cool, especially if you play titles like flight sims, racing games or big open-world adventures that can take advantage of an extra wide screen. And out of all of the concepts I’ve seen at CES 2026, this one is at the top of the list of stuff that I hope eventually gets turned into a proper retail product.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year at CES, Dreame showed off a robot vacuum prototype with a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">mechanical arm</a>. But while we were able to see the arm extend and retract, we didn’t see the device, which was described as a prototype at the time, actually grab anything, which was a bit disappointing.</p><p>This year, though, the company has made its arm-enabled vacuum a reality with the Cyber 10 Ultra. Dreame previewed it recently at IFA in Berlin, but has now confirmed it will be on sale later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The vacuum has an extendable arm that looks pretty similar to the prototype version we saw last year. It extends from the top of the vacuum and has a claw-like device at the end for scooping up objects. According to Dreame, it can pick up items that weigh up to 500 grams (about 1 pound) so it should be able to grab a wider variety of stuff than the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/roborocks-new-flagship-robot-vacuum-has-an-arm-that-can-grab-small-objects-170020390.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Roborock vac</a> we saw last year, which had a 300-gram weight limit for its arm.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="0" height="0" src="" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>The arm can also do more than pick up stuff from the floor. It supports its own cleaning accessories, and can grab vacuum nozzles and brush attachments from its base station. This allows the arm to act as an extension of the vacuum itself so it can be used similarly to how you might use hose attachments to reach hard-to-get areas with a traditional vacuum.&nbsp;</p><p>We were able to see a brief demo of the Cyber 10 arm in action on the CES show floor.  It was able to pick up balls and place them in a basket. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see it lift any heavier object or grab its cleaning attachments, but we were able to get a good look at the base station and the small cubbies where they will be stored.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_base_station.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreame_base_station.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="The base station that holds the attachments for the vacuum&#39;s arm." data-uuid="e9ecf531-8452-40b7-82fc-fe838692138e"><figcaption>The base station that holds the attachments for the vacuum&#39;s arm.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>And, like Dreame&#39;s other robot vacuums, the Cyber 10 Ultra also has mopping abilities and can climb up small steps up to 6cm (about 2.4 inches).

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the original, and<em> </em>best <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-11-total-recall-mind-bending-blu-ray-july-31st.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Total Recall,</em></a><em> </em>there’s a scene where Rekall’s receptionist uses a digital pen to change the color of her nail polish. It’s only taken 35 years, but now a company has turned up to CES 2026 with a version that actually works outside a pricey sci-fi movie. iPolish is a company which makes press-on acrylic nails that, when you apply an electric charge, changes color.</p><p>In order to enjoy kaleidoscopic nails, you’ll need to charge the wand, which then connects to your phone. Once you’ve selected your color of choice, you just put the tip of the nail into the wand, and it’ll pass a short charge into the nail to change it. Sadly, the company wouldn’t shed too much light on the process it uses to run the nails but, from my guess, it’s some sort of electrochemical shenanigans going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;All in all, it took around five seconds to change the color of a single nail, so it’s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"/><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>iPolish says that each nail can display 400 colors, and can be changed as many times as the user would like. So, if you’re coordinating your nails with your outfits, you’re not bound to a single color palette in the weeks between salon visits. They’re also surprisingly affordable, with the starter set <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ipolish.fashion/collections/starter-kits" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">costing $95</a> which contains two sets of nails, one in Ballerina cut, one in Squoval. The Ballerinas are relatively short, while the Sqovals are longer.&nbsp; It’s worth noting that you can’t shape the nails as you’ll break the hardware, so if you don’t like those shapes, you can’t use ‘em.</p><p>When it comes time to replace your nails when one breaks or you lose it in some nailbed mishap, you’ll be able to pick up spares for $6.50. Given the theoretical cost of getting your nails re-done on a weekly basis, being able to change color on a whim seems like a bargain. Of course, we won’t be able to speak to iPolish’s quality and reliability until they start shipping, which is presently expected to begin in June 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html?src=rss]]></description>

</div><p>The experience is part of Garmin&#39;s &quot;Unified Cabin&quot; concept, which explores a bunch of AI-centric in-car experiences. The demo I tried was fairly limited: while wearing a neural band, I was able to navigate two apps on a touchscreen display in Garmin&#39;s cockpit setup. In one, I used pinch and swipe gestures to manipulate an onscreen model of a car, much like how I would use the band to zoom in and out of an image while wearing the display glasses. The second demo, somewhat bizarrely, was a game of 2048. I used the same swipe gestures to move the tiles around.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither of those are the kinds of experiences you immediately think of when you imagine &quot;in-car entertainment,&quot; but Garmin, which works with a number of major car brands on infotainment systems, seems to be thinking about some more practical use cases too. The company told me that it will explore using the neural band to control vehicle functions like rolling down windows or unlocking doors.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Meta also announced a research collaboration with the University of Utah that will explore how its EMG tech can be used to help people who have ALS, muscular dystrophy and other conditions that affect the use of their hands.</p><p>Researchers will work with Meta to test gestures that could enable people to control smart speakers, blinds, thermostats, locks and other household devices using the neural band.&nbsp; &quot;Meta Neural Band is sensitive enough to detect subtle muscle activity in the wrist — even for people who can’t move their hands,&quot; the company explains in a blog post. Researchers will also look at using the band for mobility use cases, like the University of Utah&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tetraski.us/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">TetraSki</a> program, which currently uses a joystick or mouth-based controller to help participants ski. </p><p>Update, Tuesday, January 6, 2026, 3:40PM PT: Added a video from garmin’s demo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-emg-wristband-is-moving-beyond-its-ar-glasses-120000503.html?src=rss]]></description>

The 1996 game from the legendary id Software has also been designated Handheld Optimized for the Xbox ROG Ally devices. As one of the OG boomer shooters, <em>Quake</em> still commands a sizable and passionate fan base, and it&#39;s now available on just about every gaming platform imaginable.&nbsp;</p><p>Since rolling out its verification program, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-verified-5000-compatiblity-201412211.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">several thousands</a> of games have been designated as supported for the Steam Deck. Valve has more recently been preparing to have additional gaming devices run its SteamOS platform.

And don&#39;t forget that Valve&#39;s anticipated Steam Machine is due out some time early this year, so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to have those verification checkmarks start to carry more weight in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/quake-is-now-steam-deck-verified-223009852.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been using the same smartphone controller on my iPhone for years. That’s partly because most options are so similar. Announced at CES 2026, the X5 Alteron couldn’t be more different. It’s a collaboration between GameSir (which loves unusual peripheral <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-tarantula-pro"><ins>dalliances</ins></a>) and Hyperkin (retro-leaning <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyperkin-xenon-controller-announced-191629821.html"><ins>controller maker</ins></a>).</p>
<p>The X5 Alteron is apparently the world&#39;s first fully modular mobile games controller. While the headline feature might be the stick/d-pad/button modules, the X5 Alteron has a very accommodating vice grip that works with devices from iPhone and Android phones through to the Switch series and even iPads. There’s even Bluetooth if you want to use it with a PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the showfloor, Gamesir had a non-working prototype model with swappable modules, able to replicate most of your favorite layouts, including asymmetric analogue sticks, a yellow stick that’s aspiring to be a Gamecube controller and even a six-button array for those wanting to scratch that Sega Saturn itch. And if you want symmetrical sticks, you maniac, you can have that too. Rumble motors will also be built into the controller.</p>
<core-slideshow data-slideshowid="26e84b0a-6b31-45e1-8932-b9344f26b639"/>
<p>The modules lie flush when magnetically attached to the controller, although on the early prototype, they were difficult to remove. It’s pretty much fully customizable: there will be adjustable stick heights and hot-swappable buttons. Hyperkin and Gamesir are promising GameCube and N64 modules, and even a trackpad module for FPS games.</p>
<p>There’s contemporary technology too. The X5 Alteron will have capacitive sticks, not Hall-Effect ones. This should offer much more precision: the technology remains pretty rare in controllers. There are Hall-Effect analog triggers on the rear of the controller. It’s early days, with no release date or pricing set yet, but I&#39;m intrigued — and I suspect many mobile gamers are too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyperkin-and-gamesir-x5-alteron-modular-game-controller-ces-2026-221853624.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How far has Intel&#39;s embedded Arc&nbsp;graphics come over the years? Enough to let me play <em>Battlefield </em>6 at up to 190 fps in 1080p, with the graphics settings set to high, all on an unassuming Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5. There was no need for dedicated graphics, just the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Intel Core Ultra X9 388H&#39;s</a> built-in Arc B390 GPU. </p><p>There&#39;s a catch, of course: Intel&#39;s XeSS3 AI upscaling and 4X frame generation is the big reason why I was able to see such high fps figures. I was playing <em>Battlefield 6 </em>on a controller, with the Lenovo laptop connected to a TV, and I was surprised by how smooth the gameplay felt. There wasn&#39;t any sense of lag like I&#39;ve seen in earlier frame-gen implementations, though any lag would probably be more noticeable if I was playing with a high DPI gaming mouse. </p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/vU1uTQIR" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>Environmental details, shadows, lighting and particle effects also looked flawless. If I was sitting on a couch, I’d think the game was being powered by a console or a budget gaming PC. I didn’t get a chance to push the resolution up to 1440p, but it’d be interesting to see if it could maintain at least 100 fps in that mode. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-3.jpg" style="height:1095px;width:2000px;" alt="Intel Core Ultra 3 gaming on a Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5." data-uuid="4a924e24-ce61-4a46-8e36-9c465245dc5d"><figcaption>Playing &quot;Battlefield 6&quot; with a Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5, powered by Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 3 chip.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Not all of Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 3 chips will achieve such lofty gaming heights, unfortunately. Only the X7 and X9 chips include 12 Xe GPU cores and Arc B390 graphics. The rest of the Core Ultra 3 family has the typical four Xe cores and basic Intel graphics. </p><p>Intel claims the B390 is around 80 percent faster than the Radeon 890M, which is built into the Ryzen HX370. Additionally, the company says the new GPU is 76 percent faster than its Arc 140T, and overall it should offer similar performance to the mobile RTX 4050 GPU.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Intel_Core_Ultra_3_gaming-2.jpg" style="height:1236px;width:2000px;" alt="A Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5." data-uuid="1a614df4-c8a3-4a7e-bdd5-0616f3dfc66d"><figcaption>A Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s a nice discount of $64, which breaks down to 28 percent. There is a spot of bad news. The deal only applies to the hazel colorway. Other colors are discounted, but they aren&#39;t as cheap. It&#39;s not as if the hazel is hideous. These are standard dark brown-hued earbuds.</p> 
<p>The device made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a>, and this is particularly true for those tied into the Pixel ecosystem. These earbuds are on the smaller side and, more importantly, comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They also manage to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/pixel-buds-pro-2-review-tiny-earbuds-with-big-sound-and-a-direct-line-to-gemini-170016328.html">deliver pristine audio</a>, as we were fans of the punchy bass, full mids and crisp highs on offer.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The battery lasts for 30 hours when you include return trips to the charging case, at around eight hours a pop. They offer multipoint Bluetooth that switches between audio sources with just a single button press. There&#39;s an app for keeping an eye on battery levels and ANC levels.</p> 
<p>The primary downside when these were first released was the high price tag, which has been alleviated by this sale. Beyond that, there&#39;s really just one nitpick. Smaller earbuds translate to a smaller touch panel, which requires precision to operate.</p>

<p>Cosori says the air fryer is meant to address a pain point in the market regarding consumer concern over heating food in plastic air fryers. The company&#39;s answer to this is a 6.5-quart stainless steel fryer with a ceramic, nonstick coating on all surfaces that come in contact with food. Iconic has a brushed metal finish that Cosori says is corrosion resistant.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The controls and display for the fryer are seated under tempered glass atop the motor. From there, users can select from six different cooking functions consisting of air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate, proof and reheat. The fryer can run as cool as 90 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as 450.</p>
<p>Users can connect Iconic with the VeSync app, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Vesync;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d3f51408-1487-4ad5-a82e-1d819da83ad9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=89064382-8f58-4b86-8df2-ea297bfd9563&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vesync&amp;linkText=parent+company%27s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLnZlc3luYy5jb20vc3BlY2lhbC10b3BpYy8zNTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg5MDY0MzgyLThmNTgtNGI4Ni04ZGYyLWVhMjk3YmZkOTU2MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy52ZXN5bmMuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtdG9waWMvMzUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVuR2tybeZyoxvFbnuGoNv_2KUKSindU7dSQQCHLSQ2P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.vesync.com%2Fspecial-topic%2F350" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.vesync.com/special-topic/350"><ins>parent company&#39;s</ins></a> app for bluetooth-enabled devices across its brand portfolio.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IO Interactive just revealed minimum and recommended specs for the PC build of <em>007 First Light</em>. The company recommends 32GB of RAM and 12GB of VRAM. In a normal world, this wouldn&#39;t be news, as modern NVIDIA GPUs certainly have more than enough VRAM. However, we live in a world where <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html"><ins>AI companies gobble up lots of memory</ins></a><ins>.</ins></p>
<p>This has caused newer cards to tick up in price, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amd-and-nvidia-will-reportedly-raise-gpu-prices-significantly-in-2026"><ins>with more hikes to come</ins></a>. Older cards like the RTX 3070 just won&#39;t cut it, as that one ships with 8GB of VRAM. Standard RAM is also getting much more expensive, putting that 32GB out of reach for many gamers. In other words, playing the James Bond sim at max settings will likely cost a pretty Moneypenny.</p>

<p>IO also recommends an Intel Core i5 13500 or an AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, along with 80GB of storage space. Rumors have been swirling that NVIDIA is set to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-reportedly-bringing-back-2021s-rtx-3060-gpu-because-ai-is-eating-all-of-the-newer-cards-194241706.html"><ins>relaunch the RTX 3060</ins></a> from 2021 to help offset increased demand caused by the hungry hippo that is AI. That one does ship with enough VRAM to run the game at recommended settings.</p>
<p>However, mostly everyone will be able to play the game at minimum settings. It requires just an NVIDIA GTX 1660 or AMD RX 5700 and an Intel Core i5 9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500. Players must have 16GB of traditional RAM and 8GB of VRAM.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that both the recommended and minimum specs are for running the game in 1080p. The company hasn&#39;t announced anything for 4K settings, so it must be pretty bad on the VRAM front.</p>

<p>IO has also revealed a partnership with NVIDIA on the game. <em>007 First Light</em> will include DLSS 3 with Multi Frame Generation for &quot;an even deeper sense of immersion and improved performance.&quot;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If I were building a new PC today, I&#39;d go for a small form factor mATX or ITX build. With companies like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fractal-design.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Fractal Design</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://lian-li.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Lian Li</a> making cases that can fit modern GPUs without sacrificing on thermals, you don&#39;t need to settle for the old mid-tower monstrosities of yesteryear. And that&#39;s why PNY&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pny.com/company/press-center/pny-press-releases/pny-announces-new-dual-slot-slim-models-for-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">new &quot;Slim” model RTX 50-series designs</a> caught my eye.

As a result, even the largest of the three new models, the 5080, is relatively svelte, coming in at 11.8-inches or 300mm long. That means it can comfortably fit with room to spare in a media PC enclosure like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/ridge/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Fractal Ridge</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Technically, NVIDIA&#39;s reference designs for the 5070 and 5080 are also dual-slot solutions, but most of the company&#39;s manufacturing partners produce two-and-half or three slot variants of those cards. And with no Founders Edition version of the 5070 Ti available from NVIDIA, PNY&#39;s new take on that GPU will likely find a dedicated fanbase among PC enthusiasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PNY says the new cards will arrive in February, with the company planning to offer both standard and overclocked versions of all three models. However, PNY isn&#39;t sharing pricing details just yet. That probably has to do with the state of the entire PC industry right now.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft announced the first batch of incoming Game Pass titles for 2026. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> headline the first wave of the January lineup.</p><p>If you (perhaps wisely) held off on spending $70 on Ubisoft&#39;s first stab at a Star Wars game, here&#39;s your chance to try it for less. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> sets you loose in an open world as the young thief Kay Vess. The third-person action title includes melee, shooting and stealth. There’s even some speeder chases and space dogfights to scratch your (boilerplate) Star Wars itch. Does it do anything novel or innovative to justify its full price? Not really. But it can still be a good time for fans of the saga.</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> arrives on Game Pass on January 13 (cloud, PC, and current-gen Xbox consoles). It will only be available for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>If you&#39;re less into Wookies and more about <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-mocap-interview-halloween-2021-163032866.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">10-foot-tall vampire ladies</a>, there&#39;s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. Capcom&#39;s 2021 title is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-horror-games-120029388.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">&quot;a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game,&quot;</a> as Engadget&#39;s Jessica Conditt put it. In addition to the iconic Countess Alcina Dimitrescu, you&#39;ll encounter werewolves, sea creatures and the requisite creepy dolls. The franchise&#39;s eighth mainline game is something of a departure for the series, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of familiar horror, puzzles and action.</p><p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> lands on Game Pass on January 20 (cloud, console, PC). It will be available for the Ultimate, Premium and PC tiers.</p><p>There&#39;s plenty of other fare arriving this month. <em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</em> and the twin-stick shooter <em>Brews &amp; Bastards</em> arrive today. The first-person survival action game <em>Atomfall</em> and the online soccer game <em>Rematch</em> land on January 7. Finally, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> 2D pixel remake arrives on January 8.</p><p>You can check out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Microsoft&#39;s blog post</a> for more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/resident-evil-village-and-star-wars-outlaws-join-januarys-game-pass-additions-182500938.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, we went hands-on at CES with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-sound-suite-hands-on-at-ces-2026-home-theater-powered-by-dolby-atmos-flexconnect-192709499.html"><ins>LG&#39;s new Sound Suite</ins></a> speakers featuring <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html"><ins>Dolby Atmos FlexConnect</ins></a> and now we have pricing for the entire lineup. The modular home audio system consists of four speakers that include a soundbar, surround speakers and a subwoofer.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the group is the H7 soundbar, which will retail for $1,000. The soundbar uses FlexConnect to optimize sound based on the layout of a room and its location therein. This is intended to solve for when a speaker can&#39;t be perfectly placed to deliver optimal sound, especially spatial audio.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The H7 also has a feature LG is calling Sound Follow that tracks the location of a user&#39;s phone throughout a room and adapts the audio to their location. The idea is that if you move from one side of the couch to the other, or to a chair in a totally different part of the room, you&#39;ll still receive the best possible sound.</p>
<p>The M7 and M5 surround speakers will sell for $400 and $250 respectively. These serve as satellite speakers to the H7 and can be placed around a room in pairs or used on their own. The W7 subwoofer carries a price tag of $600.</p>
<p>The entire suite is available for pre-order on LG&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LG Electronics;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1d615601-adcc-4281-a201-ab5efe07476c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;linkText=US+site&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvc291bmQtc3VpdGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFkNjE1NjAxLWFkY2MtNDI4MS1hMjAxLWFiNWVmZTA3NDc2YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3VzL3NvdW5kLXN1aXRlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAduVyJ15itMjM-eugXpka59-_VWwzESWW59HnjSuo1om&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fsound-suite" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.lg.com/us/sound-suite"><ins>US site</ins></a> now. The site lists several packages like the &quot;Immersive Quad Suite 7&quot; that include the H7 soundbar and four M7 speakers.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker dove into <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> with a slew of announcements that bring new chargers and accessories under its umbrella. The new accessories include improved visual interfaces, faster Qi2 wireless charging and “upgraded ecosystems” that support the latest iPhones. Some of the latest devices are even available to buy right now.</p>
<p>First up is the Anker Nano Charger with smart display, which features a tiny screen, 180-degree foldable prongs and provides up to 45W of power. The plug can identify the exact iPhone model connected and then deliver the right amount of power for your phone. Anker says the Nano uses three-stage power delivery and a "Care Mode" that the company claims keeps batteries cooler than some competing 45W chargers. It arrives in late January 2026 and will retail for $40.</p>
<p>For fans of wireless charging stations, the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station offers a 3-in-1 solution for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. It uses a "AirCool" system for "faster, safer performance" and offers up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. The design is also foldable for compact travel. It's set for release in Q1 2026 and will retail for $150.</p>
<p>The company debuted a clamp-on 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip with 70W of output and built-in surge protection. It sports two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and six AC outlets. The Nano Power Strip is getting a late January release, and it will sell for $70.</p>
<p>Anker also unveiled a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station. This serves as an all-in-one hub with support for up to three displays (with 4K resolution supported on a single display), up to 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between connected devices. It also features a removable 6-in-1 hub with SD and microSD card readers, a USB-A port and a 5 Gbps USB-C port. The Nano Docking Station is available now and retails for $150.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese micromobility company Navee has some wild new stuff at CES 2026. The lineup is headlined by the UT5 Ultra X, a dual-motor e-scooter with an advertised top speed of 43 mph. And who among us isn&#39;t in the market for an auto-following golf cart and a seaplane?</p><p>The flagship UT5 Ultra X is a sleek-looking e-scooter with a pair of 2,400W motors. Navee says it can reach a top speed of 43 mph and has a max range of 87 miles. (However, in the world of e-scooters, it&#39;s safe to expect the real-world range to be around half of what manufacturers promise.) It has a front and rear hydraulic suspension and front and rear hydraulic disc brakes. Navee claims it can accelerate from 0 to 12 mph in 1.98 seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_scooter.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_scooter.jpg" style="height:737px;width:1020px;" alt="Rendering of a helmeted person riding the UT5 Ultra X e-scooter on a racetrack." data-uuid="d859b3cb-4211-46c0-b6c7-f4d9affb665c"><figcaption>Navee UT5 Ultra X</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Navee</div></figure><p>If you want something that can hold its own on rougher terrain, there&#39;s the NT5 Ultra X. A pair of 1,200W motors helps this e-scooter reach a top speed of 40 mph and an advertised range of 56 miles. It has dual-disc brakes and an electronic anti-lock braking system. To help manage the bumps, it has two suspension types: a front telescopic suspension and a rear spring one. Navee claims its steel frame supports up to 330 lbs.</p><p>Then there&#39;s the Eagle F1X, which could put golf caddies out of work. This electronic cart can carry your clubs (up to 44 lbs). It has a &quot;smart auto-follow&quot; feature that uses a combination of AI and ultra-wideband. It also responds to voice and gesture controls. The 33-lb. cart uses a pair of 250W motors, and Navee claims it can handle 36-hole games. Strangely, the bottom portion looks like an F1 racer because, hey, why not?</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_golf_push_cart_caddy.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/navee_golf_push_cart_caddy.jpg" style="height:737px;width:1020px;" alt="Render of a golfer using the Navee Eagle F1X as its caddy, following behind." data-uuid="4179c3ca-cdad-4d2c-9fc7-1a1c6447a036"><figcaption>Navee Eagle F1X</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Navee</div></figure><p>To further prove that Navee isn&#39;t afraid to jump the shark, the company has a product that could, well, jump over sharks. The WaveFly 5X is an electric seaplane that can &quot;glide on the water and ride into the sky.&quot; The company claims a max speed of 53 mph, a cruising speed of 40 mph, and a maximum flight time of 70 minutes. I&#39;m not ready to put my life in its hands, but surely some deep-pocketed adventurer will.</p><p>In addition to real-world ranges almost always being much lower than advertised, there are other caveats. First, post-purchase customer support in the world of micromobility is almost always a sketchy prospect. I once had to file a Better Business Bureau claim to get support from even the most well-established brand, Segway. Don&#39;t be shocked to experience the same or worse from lesser-known companies.</p><p>Second, Navee hasn&#39;t yet listed pricing or release dates for its new models. Based on their specs and the company&#39;s older gear, you&#39;ll likely see prices of well above $1,000 for each one. (And that’s not even counting the seaplane.)
