                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to hear Apple Music’s lossless catalog the way it was meant to sound, you will need a little extra hardware. iPhones and most wireless headphones still have limitations when it comes to high-resolution audio, which means a good DAC can make a real difference in clarity and detail. Whether you listen through wired earbuds, studio headphones or a home speaker setup, the right DAC can bring out far more texture in your music.<br><br>Lossless audio can be confusing at first, especially with different formats and file sizes to consider, but you do not need a complicated setup to enjoy it. Many DACs work across iOS, Android, Mac and Windows, and several are small enough to carry every day. In this guide, we picked the best DACs for Apple Music so you can upgrade your listening experience without wasting money on gear you do not need.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-dac-faqs">DAC FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-does-dac-stand-for"><strong>What does DAC stand for?</strong></h3> 
<p>DAC stands for digital to analogue converter. A digital-to-analog converter takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC). Some high-end DACs even include XLR outputs for better connectivity with professional audio equipment.</p> 
<p>The best DACs tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions like DSD. Most standalone DACs require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into — in which case expect a hit to your battery life.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-do-i-need-new-hardware-to-listen-to-music"><strong>Why do I need new hardware to listen to music?</strong></h3> 
<p>The short answer is, you don’t. You can play “hi-res” audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device’s audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that’s the experience you’ll get. If you want to enjoy better sounding music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you’ll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones, potentially using a headphone amp for an enhanced experience.</p> 
<p>It’s worth pointing out that “lossless” and “hi-res” are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses ALAC encoding which is compressed, but without “loss” to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate above 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above.</p> 
<p>This, of course, isn’t only about Apple’s new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to get the best sound and upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean digital signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop’s internal sound chipset often doesn’t have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience, meaning a better DAC could make all the difference in sound quality.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-okay-but-cant-i-just-use-the-headphone-adapter-for-my-phone"><strong>Okay, but can’t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone?</strong></h3> 
<p>No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often is an audio interface and most of the ones you’re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are “passive” and really just connect you to the phone’s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-bluetooth-headphones"><strong>What about Bluetooth headphones?</strong></h3> 
<p>Chances are that over the last few years you’ve migrated from wired to wireless headphones (thanks, Apple). The world of Bluetooth headphones changes things a little when it comes to seeking better audio performance. What matters here is twofold, the headphones you’re using (as those will technically be the “DAC”) and the codec — the method used to send the musical data over to the headphones.</p> 
<p>It’s also worth checking to see if your headphones support aptX and which version. Look out for aptX HD, aptX Adaptive and (for the highest quality) aptX Lossless which are all better than standard and becoming more common, albeit slowly. It’s worth noting that both your phone or media player <em>and</em> your headphones need to support the same aptX codec. Currently, no iPhone supports any type of aptX, though dongles exist that will offer that functionality.</p> 
<p>Other higher-resolution Bluetooth codecs exist, like Sony’s LDAC, but Qualcomm’s AptX has wider support thanks to its prevalence in Android devices. Some high-end wireless headphones might even come with a headphone jack for wired connections when higher-quality audio is needed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company said that it has focused on expanding the Peanuts IP since it bought 39 percent of the brand years ago. “With this additional ownership stake, we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the ʻPEANUTSʼ brand by drawing on the Sony Groupʼs extensive global network and collective expertise,” Sony Music Entertainment Japan CEO Shunsuke Muramatsu added. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sony-is-buying-peanuts-022341467.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember back in September when President Donald Trump signed an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trump-signs-executive-order-saying-his-tiktok-deal-is-legal-204607521.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">executive order</a> that seemingly finalized some of the terms of a deal to spin off TikTok&#39;s US business? Three months later, that same deal is apparently one step closer to being official.</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/tiktok-says-it-signed-agreements-to-create-new-us-joint-venture" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, TikTok CEO Shou Chew told employees that TikTok and ByteDance had signed off the agreement for control of TikTok&#39;s US business. It sounds like terms of the deal are roughly the same as what Trump announced earlier this year. A group of US investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will control a majority of the new entity while ByteDance will keep a smaller stake in the venture.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Chew&#39;s memo, the deal is expected to close January 22, 2026. “Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” he wrote according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.&nbsp; TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Notably, it&#39;s still not clear where Chinese officials stand on the deal. Trump said back in September that China was &quot;fully on board,&quot; but subsequent meetings between the two sides have so far produced vague statements. In October, China&#39;s Commerce Ministry <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/china-says-it-will-work-with-u-s-to-resolve-tiktok-issues-after-trump-xi-meeting" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">said</a> it would &quot;work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If a deal is indeed finalized by next month, it will come almost exactly a year after Trump&#39;s first executive order <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-delays-tiktok-ban-for-at-least-75-days-via-executive-order-014523110.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">to delay</a> a law that required a sale or ban of the app front taking effect. He has signed off several other extensions since. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trumps-tiktok-deal-is-another-step-closer-to-finally-actually-happening-001813404.html?src=rss]]></description>

After all the raised eyebrows, a representative from LG has reached out to say that the company &quot;will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the spokesperson, the Copilot icon is a shortcut for launching the AI chatbot in the TV&#39;s web browser rather than an application embedded in the appliance. We&#39;ve asked for more specifics about when people will be able to get rid of the Copilot prompt, but have not received a response at this time.</p>

Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D54JZTHY&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=24b60c33-f851-4bee-9d8b-9c00c8cc034a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=AirTags&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRiNjBjMzMtZjg1MS00YmVlLTlkOGItOWMwMGM4Y2MwMzRhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR-tHxD_n-S9V6FZTggBPzQxNCDZMIugRbDnHNS6azZ_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?"><ins>AirTags</ins></a> for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we&#39;ve seen for these Bluetooth trackers.&nbsp;</p>

 <core-commerce id="3f2e8dbba5f04aee8fc64ab5334170d5" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html"><ins>useful accessories</ins></a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The ripples of the auto industry&#39;s chip shortage are still being felt, as evidenced by Honda. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/chip-shortage-lingers-as-honda-to-halt-output-in-japan-china" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reported</a> on Wednesday that the automaker will suspend production in Japan on January 5 and 6. (Honda didn&#39;t specify the affected factories.) In addition, all three of the automaker&#39;s Guangqi Honda Automobile plants in China will shut down from December 29 to January 2.</p><p>The halt is an outgrowth of a chip shortage stemming from a recent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/tech/netherlands-nexperia-us-china-tech-war-intl-hnk" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">geopolitical proxy war</a> in the Netherlands, of all places. In October, the Dutch government, bowing to pressure from the Trump administration, seized control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia. The company, which operates in the Netherlands, makes low-end chips that power automobiles, appliances and other tech.</p><p>The Dutch government&#39;s official explanation for the seizure was that Nexperia had &quot;serious governance shortcomings.&quot; It cited a concern that Nexperia&#39;s Chinese majority owner, Wingtech, would move key technology out of Europe. However, the <em>New York Times </em>later <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=965d4db1-6e2c-40e4-80bc-b331d9f5112c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=reported&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEyLzEwL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEvZHV0Y2gtbmV4cGVyaWEtemhhbmctY2VvLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk2NWQ0ZGIxLTZlMmMtNDBlNC04MGJjLWIzMzFkOWY1MTEyYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyNS8xMi8xMC93b3JsZC9hc2lhL2R1dGNoLW5leHBlcmlhLXpoYW5nLWNlby5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe3OZL1LJZiFCLzmRvLzM4ZIj3TdaKPKglt7y9Lciq5u&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F12%2F10%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fdutch-nexperia-zhang-ceo.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/world/asia/dutch-nexperia-zhang-ceo.html">reported</a> that the Dutch government had known about those plans since 2019.</p><p>Regardless, China retaliated by blocking exports of Nexperia-made chips. The Netherlands eventually <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">suspended</a> its intervention, following &quot;constructive talks.&quot; China then relaxed (but did not entirely remove) its restrictions through exemptions to export controls. The uneasy resolution hasn’t been enough to help supply chains fully recover.</p><p>Honda initially anticipated that production would return to normal starting in late November. So much for that. &quot;No one [in the auto industry] prepared for geopolitical disruption,&quot; automaker consultant Ambrose Conroy, CEO of Seraph Consulting, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-nexperia-chip-crisis-upended-auto-supply-chains-again-2025-11-24/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">told</a> <em>Reuters</em> in November. &quot;And they&#39;re still not prepared.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/auto-chip-shortage-honda-will-pause-production-in-japan-and-china-200857591.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Displace first tried its hand at reimagining the TV in 2023, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/displace-wireless-tv-hands-on-002620453.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a wireless screen</a> that suctions onto walls and features built-in rechargeable batteries. At CES 2026, the company is not only introducing new versions of its own TVs, it&#39;s also showing off the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/displace-redefines-wall-mounts-at-ces-2026-with-displace-hub-turning-any-tv-into-a-truly-wireless-smart-display-on-the-wall-302645568.html?tc=eml_cleartime" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Displace Hub</a>, an accessory that can make other TVs wireless.</p><p>The Displace Hub is a wall-mounting system with some extra bells and whistles. It combines the &quot;active-loop suction&quot; of Displace’s TVs, with a rechargeable battery that can power whatever screen you mount on it and a built-in PC that runs Displace&#39;s &quot;ambient computing platform.&quot; The Hub uses an Intel N-150 4-core CPU with an integrated GPU, 16GB RAM and 128GB of storage to run Displace&#39;s operating system, and includes a 15,000mAh battery to keep everything powered. The Hub also has two HDMI inputs for external devices and supports Displace&#39;s Controller 2.0, which offers a second screen for additional information and content.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Displace-Hub-back.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Displace-Hub-back.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A rendering of the back of a Displace Hub feature circular &quot;active-loop&quot; suction mounts." data-uuid="c71f30dc-bc9e-48ff-8e0c-5655276a5c39"/><figcaption>The Displace Hub uses the same &quot;active-loop suction&quot; system as the Displace TV.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Displace</div></figure><p>The mounting system does have some notable limits, however. Displace says the Hub can support weights up to 150 pounds, and is specifically designed to mount TVs between 55 and 100 inches, which might rule out the TV you already own. The battery life of the Displace Hub could also be a concern. Connecting your TV to the Hub&#39;s integrated battery is supposed to eliminate the need for unsightly power cables, but depending on how often you watch and the energy demands of your screen, you might be recharging fairly often. Displace says the Displace Hub&#39;s battery life lasts anywhere from five to 10 hours. While the Hub can be recharged while keeping your TV mounted at the same time, having to plug and unplug your TV setup from a charger seems like it could defeat the point of having a wireless TV in the first place.</p><p>Other TV makers have tried to offer mostly wireless screens at CES in the past, like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-signature-m3-oled-tv-zero-connect-160030192.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">LG Signature OLED M3</a> and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-ces-2025-tv-lineup-includes-8k-ai-enhancements-and-a-wireless-connect-box-030058512.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN990F</a>, which use wireless breakout boxes to stream HDMI connections to their TV screens. Both of those TVs were focused on reducing the number of cables that you connect to your screen rather than eliminating cables entirely, though, a goal that still comes with tradeoffs based on the limitations of the Displace Hub.&nbsp;</p><p>Displace hasn&#39;t announced a release date for the Displace Hub, but the company says that the mounting system will cost $1,900 at launch and will be available to pre-order during CES 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-displace-hub-can-make-your-normal-tv-wireless-193837460.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple just announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ads.apple.com/app-store/help/ad-placements/0082-search-results#ntf"><ins>it will be integrating more ads</ins></a> into the App Store because our poor eyeballs must be assaulted at all times. The company plans on littering search results with advertisements <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/17/apple-announces-more-ads-are-coming-to-app-store-search-results/"><ins>beginning next year</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the App Store only has one ad spot. That&#39;s at the very top of search results. If you search for something like Instagram it&#39;s likely that top spot will be filled with an ad for a rival social media platform. The new ads will appear further down the actual search results.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple says that advertisers won&#39;t have to alter their campaigns, as the ads will &quot;run in either the existing position — at the top of search results — or further down in search results.&quot; The company says that 65 percent of app downloads happen after a search, so this move will &quot;give advertisers more opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>Google began inundating the Play Store <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/general/articles/google-wants-shove-more-ads-154557115.html"><ins>with more ads last year</ins></a> and, well, the results <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1inbdxg/the_play_store_is_90_ads/"><ins>haven&#39;t been pretty</ins></a>. The general consensus is that the store has become <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-ads-are-becoming-unbearable/"><ins>more frustrating to use</ins></a>. We&#39;ll have to wait and see just how intrusive these App Store ads end up being.</p>
<p>Recent reporting also indicates that Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-reportedly-getting-ready-to-introduce-ads-to-its-maps-app-170654072.html"><ins>plans on bringing ads to the Maps app</ins></a>. This is reportedly scheduled for next year, though the company has yet to comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-bringing-even-more-ads-to-the-app-store-193416921.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trump media, the company behind the president&#39;s personal social media platform Truth Social, is inexplicably merging with a Google-backed fusion energy company called TAE Technologies. The deal is worth $6 billion, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e1978d5-535b-4241-872f-38db778df694?utm_social_post_id=626593619&amp;utm_social_handle_id=10977192"><ins>according to reporting by </ins><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Why is an entity known for publishing frenzied hot takes by the president at 3AM combining with a fusion energy company? Who the heck really knows, but a statement says the two organizations will join together to build the &quot;world&#39;s first utility-scale fusion power plant.&quot; This would be huge, if true, as there are currently no operational commercial nuclear fusion power plants.</p>

<p>We know what TAE would bring to the table in that scenario. The energy company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://tae.com/about-us/history-of-innovation-2025/"><ins>has been around since the 1990s</ins></a> and has attracted interest from Google, Chevron and others. Trump Media would be a great partner when building a reactor <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/15/politics/trump-rob-reiner-truth-social-post"><ins>powered by insults</ins></a>, but doesn&#39;t seem to offer much of anything else.</p>
<p>The merger statement does mention that Trump Media would provide TAE with &quot;access to significant capital.&quot; The company <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/11/07/trump-media-truth-social-djt-tmtg-taylor-swift/"><ins>lost $55 million last quarter</ins></a>, as there&#39;s only so much money in a social media platform primarily used by just one person.</p>
<p>However, the president himself is likely the world&#39;s most renowned raiser of funds when it comes to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/big-tech-is-helping-to-pay-for-trumps-ballroom-that-we-all-definitely-want-162545434.html"><ins>personal pet projects</ins></a>. He knows how to get a roomful of billionaires to open up their wallets, provide copious compliments and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/big-tech-bent-the-knee-for-trump-in-2025-140000365.html"><ins>even hand-deliver gold statues</ins></a>. The terms of the deal state that Trump Media will provide TAE with $300 million in capital as a bonus of sorts, though we don&#39;t know where that money is coming from as it represents over ten percent of the company&#39;s entire valuation.</p>

The tighter regulations for Apple and Google, which overlap <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-repeats-its-long-held-criticism-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-130058440.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">with Europe&#39;s</a>, took effect today. Users in the US and elsewhere won&#39;t see any of these changes.</p><p>Apple&#39;s changes in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-262-is-here-with-another-liquid-glass-tweak-new-podcasts-features-and-more-181020133.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">iOS 26.2</a> in Japan revolve around alternative app stores, payments outside the App Store and browser choice. The company worked with Japanese regulators on new protections for increased security risks.</p><p>The company calls this set of safeguards Notarization. It involves an authorization process for alternative app stores and child-safety protocols. Third-party marketplaces will need to undergo a baseline security review. This uses a combination of human and automated checks to block malware and other threats.</p><p>Naturally, Apple cautions that Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Store&#39;s reviews. &quot;The App Store — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store&#39;s high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love,&quot; the company wrote.</p><p>To state the obvious, the App Store is a booming business for the iPhone maker. In 2024, it <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-app-store-generated-nearly-13-trillion-in-sales-in-2024-130002805.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">generated $1.3 trillion</a> in total sales. Opening it up poses a threat to one of the company&#39;s most reliable revenue streams. Big Tech seems to talk a lot about fewer rewards and more penalties for <em>users</em> when <em>their own</em> money trees are at risk.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2025-12/3ea018f2-9302-4343-839c-68fa2f930c15" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2025-12/3ea018f2-9302-4343-839c-68fa2f930c15" style="height:1809px;width:2714px;" alt="Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) applauds as US President Donald Trump delivers a speech to business leaders at the US ambassador&#39;s residence in Tokyo on October 28, 2025.

Developers can now use non-Apple payment processors within their apps or link to external websites for purchases. (Children&#39;s content is exempt from this.) Here, Apple again warns the user about the penalties for doing something that will hurt its bottom line. &quot;For apps that use alternative payment processing or link users to the web for transactions, Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams or fraud,&quot; the company cautioned.</p><p>The last big change involves picking defaults within the operating system. Users in Japan will see new browser and search engine choice screens. They&#39;ll also find default controls for navigation apps and app stores. Finally, developers can now offer browsers that use alternative engines other than Apple&#39;s WebKit.</p><p>Apple&#39;s announcement comes a day after Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/complying-with-mobile-software-competition-act/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">detailed</a> its compliance with the MSCA. Since Android is more open than iOS, Google&#39;s changes in response to the regulations are a bit less pronounced. Android users will find new browser / search choice screens, expanded billing options and side-by-side comparisons of external vs. Play Store payment options.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-opens-up-ios-in-japan-in-response-to-new-regulations-174854950.html?src=rss]]></description>

Through December 29, you can sign up for an annual Fan subscription for $67, down from the usual $80, or a Mega Fan subscription for $100, down from $120.</p> 
<p>While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll&#39;s library, new episodes &quot;shortly after they air in Japan&quot; and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Notably missing from either subscription is access to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/a-new-crunchyroll-manga-mobile-app-arrives-later-this-year-155234860.html">Crunchyroll&#39;s new Manga service</a>, but unless you&#39;re specifically looking for reading material, you&#39;ll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll&#39;s video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You&#39;ll find long-running series like <em>One Piece</em> and newer hits like <em>Spy X Family</em>, alongside hundreds of more niche series.</p> 
<p>Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-220920170.html">acquired by Sony</a>, it&#39;s been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/crunchyroll-blames-third-party-vendor-for-ai-subtitle-mess-145621606.html">produced poor results</a>. It&#39;s hard to beat Crunchyroll&#39;s library, though, and for as little as $65, you&#39;ll get more than your money&#39;s worth.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon just introduced a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-ring-doorbell-ai-greetings"><ins>new feature for Alexa+ called Greetings</ins></a>. This lets Alexa+ answer the doorbell and converse with visitors, which certainly sounds futuristic in a &quot;gated community as dystopia&quot; kind of way.</p>
<p>There are several caveats here. First of all, it only works with certain newer Ring video doorbell models. Customers also have to pony up for a Ring Premium Plan and have access to the Alexa+ early access build. It&#39;s available in the US and Canada and only in English.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you meet those criteria, this could be a fairly useful little feature. Amazon says it &quot;transforms your Ring doorbell into an intelligent assistant capable of determining who&#39;s at your door, understanding what they need and responding conversationally.&quot; The company promises that the tool operates whether people or home or out doing errands.</p>
<p>How does this work? It&#39;s an AI algorithm that &quot;determines who&#39;s there based on what they&#39;re wearing, holding or their actions.&quot; It will use &quot;visual context, any information the visitor shares and the instructions it&#39;s been given to help manage interactions on your behalf.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazon says that it can, for instance, distinguish if a person is wearing a delivery uniform and tell them to leave the package at the back door. Most of my delivery drivers don&#39;t come to the door in full uniforms because it&#39;s winter and that would be ridiculous. I don&#39;t even expect that during the summer. In other words, this is modern AI and mistakes will happen.</p>
<p>The company gives other examples of how this could be used, like gathering messages from friends who stop by and telling door-to-door salespeople to (politely) bug off. Amazon also says Alexa+ will be able to direct visitors to water and snacks that have previously been laid out. Finally, there&#39;s a way to avoid those pesky cute kids on Halloween while still providing them with treats.</p>
<p>Everything can be reviewed later on via the Ring app, which should provide context as to who has been hanging around the porch. Alexa+ Greetings are rolling out today.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Alexa+ is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">Amazon&#39;s updated chatbot</a>. It&#39;s more conversational than the old Alexa, which could be useful or annoying depending on what you use it for. I use Alexa primarily as an alarm, so I don&#39;t necessarily want a gabfest.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-can-now-answer-your-ring-doorbell-and-talk-to-people-162712774.html?src=rss]]></description>

Predating both Facebook and Twitter, the website, which was designed to help people organize in-person events, has changed hands a handful of times in recent years.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, founder Scott Heiferman sold it to WeWork, which offloaded it a few years later before <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wework-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-030708470.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">declaring bankruptcy in 2023</a>. As of 2024, Bending Spoons, the Italian tech company that&#39;s probably best known for buying <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/evernote-bending-spoons-acquisition-201505825.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Evernote in 2022</a>, has been running Meetup.&nbsp;</p><p>In the aftermath of the pandemic, the platform has seen something of resurgence. As of late 2025, Gen Z and young Millennials make up 40 percent of Meetup&#39;s active user base and represent its most engaged group of users. This year, the app has also seen a 20 percent year-over-year increase in new registrations. Going into 2026, Bending Spoons is hoping to build on that momentum with a redesign of Meetup&#39;s mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>The new interface, which starts rolling out today, brings the Android and iOS app inline with Meetup&#39;s recently redesigned website. Across the application, users can expect updated fonts, new more colorful icons and better spacing. The goal of the redesign is to make the app &quot;vibrant, fun and more modern than before,&quot; says Chiara Vivaldi, Meetup&#39;s product lead. She adds the redesigned app retains all the key features found in the previous version, while making those easier to find. For instance, users can access their profile and groups directly from the homepage of the app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond making Meetup feel more modern, Bending Spoon is using the redesign to cement the groundwork for a series of improvements it plans to roll out in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Roadmap_asset_%E2%80%A2_Profiles.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Roadmap_asset_%E2%80%A2_Profiles.png" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Soon, Meetup users will be able to see a breakdown of the people who have signed up for an event." data-uuid="9fbbd01c-2e5c-4fac-aabd-afb9e0d0e37a"><figcaption>Soon, Meetup users will be able to see a breakdown of the people who have signed up for an event.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bending Spoons</div></figure><p>According to Vivaldi, one major priority is to give people, particularly women, more confidence to attend the events that are listed on Meetup. When you navigate to an event page in the new app, you&#39;ll see a broad gender and age breakdown of the users who have signed up to be there. Additionally, new and richer user profiles allow people to get a better sense of who exactly they might meet if they decide to go. Bending Spoons is also introducing a new Super Organizer badge it plans to award to the platform&#39;s top event planners. It&#39;s designed to signal to users that the person who put together the event takes community building seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Taken together, Vivaldi says these features are designed to reduce the friction of attending events where you might not know anyone, and they&#39;re something the company plans to build on in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Bending Spoons plans to make it easier for organizers to use Meetup. Starting early next year, the company will unify Meetup&#39;s two disparate apps — right now, the company maintains separate ones for members and organizers. Vivaldi says organizers can expect the unified app to include all of the features they depend on, alongside a handful of enhancements. For instance, Vivaldi’s team is working to make QR-based ticketing the norm for check-ins and attendance tracking. She says the move to a single app is informed by the fact that 75 percent of Meetup&#39;s organizers got their start as a member.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;[Organizers] are part of the community. They want to be in the action, and so having them within the same app is conducive to that. They can jump into conversations, look at other events, making it all feel a bit more organic,&quot; Vivaldi said. In the meantime, if it’s been since you’ve used Meetup, you  can download the redesigned app from the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=30d2e469-9244-431a-8b29-6e1d2254f8ef&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=App&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9tZWV0dXAtc29jaWFsLWV2ZW50cy1ncm91cHMvaWQzNzU5OTAwMzgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwZDJlNDY5LTkyNDQtNDMxYS04YjI5LTZlMWQyMjU0ZjhlZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvbWVldHVwLXNvY2lhbC1ldmVudHMtZ3JvdXBzL2lkMzc1OTkwMDM4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAY-lVXV4VGRn9i4-Wk4KYjBSxiQl2AFWxJJyEI9CxAjM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fmeetup-social-events-groups%2Fid375990038" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;slk:App;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meetup-social-events-groups/id375990038">App</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=30d2e469-9244-431a-8b29-6e1d2254f8ef&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Google+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLm1lZXR1cCZobD1lbl9DQSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzBkMmU0NjktOTI0NC00MzFhLThiMjktNmUxZDIyNTRmOGVmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLm1lZXR1cCZobD1lbl9DQSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXKNw2Oi6l514NhJDWJnFvkL2sY5b7ml7dixfOHM8EQZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.meetup%26hl%3Den_CA" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meetup&amp;hl=en_CA">Google Play</a> stores. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/meetups-new-mobile-app-is-designed-to-make-it-easier-to-meet-people-irl-150000920.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>So you want to give someone a gift but you don’t have a ton of cash to spare. Don’t fret because first, you’re not alone, and second, there are tons of options to choose from. Especially if you’re looking in the tech space, it can feel especially daunting to find a gadget that’s affordable but also worth gifting — in other words, not a piece of junk that will eventually take up residence at the bottom of a drawer. But you don’t have to drain your wallet to get someone a cool gadget that will both be useful and make their lives easier. We’ve collected our favorite pieces of tech under $25 that make great gifts and help you to stick to a budget.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items.

Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these.

<p>Subscription boxes are the rare gift that keeps its charm long after the wrapping paper is gone. You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has introduced an app directory that&#39;s now available right inside ChatGPT, the company announced. &quot;Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take action like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck or search for an apartment,&quot; the company wrote in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/">blog post</a>. OpenAI also noted in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-apps-in-chatgpt">help document</a> that &quot;connector&quot; apps like Google Drive are now simply called &quot;apps.&quot;</p>
<p>The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) is divided into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and sites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox. To use an app, simply click on it, hit &quot;Connect&quot; then authorize the app to access ChatGPT. With that done, you can then start a chat related to that app. In the case of Dropbox, for instance, you&#39;ll be able to &quot;gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,&quot; according to the description. Once connected, any app can be accessed by doing an @ mention of it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A new addition that came along with the store is an Apple Music app that, like Spotify, helps users find music, create playlists and manage their libraries through a chat interface. Another is DoorDash, which lets you transform recipes, meal planning and staples into &quot;an actionable shopping cart.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with the app directory, OpenAI is now allowing developers to submit apps for review and publication in ChatGPT according to the company&#39;s app submission <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-developer-guidelines">guidelines.</a> It also published resources to help developers build such apps, including <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://developers.openai.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-chatgpt-app">best practices</a>, open-source example apps, an open-sourced UI library for chat-native interfaces and a step-by-step <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/quickstart/">quickstart guide</a>. That&#39;s on top of the software developer kit (SDK) that OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canva-and-other-apps-can-now-connect-to-chatgpt-194830116.html">introduced in October</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI noted that for now, developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to the native app or website — but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well. Privacy was also emphasized, with companies required to provide &quot;clear&quot; policies.</p>
<p>The new feature is a big part of Sam Altman&#39;s promises to make ChatGPT more versatile with the addition of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gpts-are-the-single-application-mini-chatgpt-models-that-anyone-can-create-203311858.html">custom &quot;GPT&quot; bots</a>. &quot;Over time, we want apps in ChatGPT to feel like a natural extension of the conversation, helping people move from ideas to action, while building a thriving ecosystem for developers,&quot; the company wrote.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-white-elephant-faqs">White elephant FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-white-elephant">What is white elephant?</h3> 
<p>A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-does-white-elephant-work">How does white elephant work?</h3> 
<p>A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-it-called-white-elephant">Why is it called white elephant?</h3> 
<p>The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.</p>

That&#39;s an all-time-low price and better than the price it was during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation.</p>

<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">the best AirPods</a> available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">Engadget&#39;s review</a> this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &quot;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&quot; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Ultrahuman Ring Air now has the capacity to track snoring and general respiratory health. This is thanks to proprietary technology called Respiratory Health PowerPlug, which is basically a suite of audio analysis tools along with some &quot;advanced biomarker tracking&quot; and AI tomfoolery.</p>
<p>All of this results in &quot;one of the most comprehensive consumer tools ever built for understanding nighttime respiratory stability.&quot; It details snoring sessions, of course, but also delivers a holistic and &quot;actionable sleep picture.&quot; The company says this &quot;reveals patterns, trends and changes in respiratory health over time.&quot;</p>

<p>To that end, it can also detect coughing and respiratory disturbances. This data is cross-referenced with movement patterns, sleep fragmentation patterns and resting heart rate to &quot;show exactly how breathing issues shape sleep quality.&quot; The company says this can be a good resource when experimenting with interventions, like switching to a new pillow or taping up the nose.</p>
<p>More health data is never a bad thing, but this information isn&#39;t free. Ultrahuman is charging $4 per month for access to the tool, though folks can pick up an annual subscription for $40.</p>

Some of the testers saw prices up to 23 percent higher than what the other testers saw, though the average difference for the same list of items was around 7 percent. Those higher prices could cost customers over $1,000 more in expenses for the year. </p><p>“The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,” the FTC told Reuters in a statement. “But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart’s alleged pricing practices.”</p><p>When the study came out, Instacart told Engadget that the pricing variances were caused by some of its retail partners doing “limited, short-term and randomized tests” to better understand consumers. Those randomized pricing tests were enabled by Instacart’s AI pricing tool called Eversight developed by a company it purchased in 2022.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year Sony <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html">sued Tencent</a> for copyright infringement over its <em>Light of Motiram</em> game, calling it a &quot;slavish clone&quot; of Horizon Zero Dawn. Then, earlier this month, Tencent agreed to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html">stop promoting</a> and publicly testing the game. Now, the two companies have reached a &quot;confidential settlement&quot; and the case has been dismissed, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court documents</a> seen by <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a>. <em>Light of Motiram</em> has also disappeared from Steam and Epic&#39;s game stores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,&quot; Tencent&#39;s spokesperson told <em>The Verge.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Sony first filed its lawsuit in July 2025, it said that Tencent&#39;s game appeared to copy aspects of not just <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, but other franchise games including <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-horizon-adventures-might-be-sonys-most-important-game-of-the-year-160026354.html"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a>. That included the post-apocalyptic setting with humans and machines coexisting, the visual appearance of characters and even the marketing materials — something Engadget certainly noticed when Tencent first announced the game.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s AirPods have become the default choice for many people, whether you want simple wireless earbuds that work without fuss or premium options with features like noise cancellation and spatial audio. The lineup has grown over the years, so there is now a model for almost every type of listener. Some pairs are built for all-day comfort, others focus on isolation and richer sound, and Apple’s over-ear option offers a more immersive experience for movies and music.<br><br>If you spend most of your time on an iPhone or iPad, all AirPods share one big advantage: they connect instantly and switch between Apple devices seamlessly. With new models always on the horizon and longtime favorites still holding up well, we rounded up the best AirPods to help you decide which ones match your listening style.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-you-need-to-know-about-airpods">What you need to know about AirPods</h2> 
<p>When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-4-with-anc">AirPods 4 with ANC</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> represent the first time active noise cancellation has been available on the open-wear, “regular” AirPods. Design-wise, they’re the same as the non-ANC model, so the difference is entirely in the features list. This more expensive version adds Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness and a wireless charging case. The ANC isn’t as powerful as the AirPods Pro 2, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 doesn’t completely seal off your ears. The noise-canceling performance is definitely useful though, working best with constant, low-frequency annoyances like fans and white noise machines. Lastly, you won’t get access to Apple’s hearing test and hearing aid features, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 with ANC doesn’t seal off your ears, which would affect accuracy and effectiveness.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0">who Pepe Silvia is</a> when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney's streaming prices chart</a>, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-do-wireless-charging-pads-work-with-any-phone-or-device">Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?</h2> 
<p>The short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that’s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>When it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you’re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you’re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you’ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up.</p> 
<p>Those with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don’t support Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B09BZ17JM7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=92afccad-7a6d-4b3e-b701-91c6301fd52f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=magnetic+adapter+for+pretty+cheap&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdEX_d0-vXtE7h5w9QtUo9s6V3nZnhWggLO4XCvtu56x&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FESR-HaloLock-Universal-Conversion-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB09BZ17JM7%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-Universal-Conversion-Compatible/dp/B09BZ17JM7/">magnetic adapter for pretty cheap</a> that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers.

<p>Even without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.</p> 
<p>If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones.</p> 
<p>A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.</p> 
<p>For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-charging-speed-and-performance">Wireless charging speed and performance</h2> 
<p>It’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.</p> 
<p>Today, most wireless chargers come in at 15W for phones. The latest Qi2 standard can get you up to 25W of power with a compatible smartphone. These speeds are improving bit by bit, but they&#39;re still not quite as fast as wired charging. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough.</p> 
<p>If you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is teaming up with Dolby for a new collection of speakers that the companies are unveiling ahead of CES 2026. The LG Sound Suite features a modular lineup the H7 soundbar, M7 and M5 wireless surround speakers and the W7 subwoofer. The speakers can be combined in more than two dozen different configurations, from a pair to a full 13.1.7 channel surround sound home theater setup.</p><p>The main pitch of the LG Sound Suite is its application of Dolby Atmos FlexConnect. This is the audio brand&#39;s tech for optimizing sound from wherever wireless speakers are placed. It&#39;s meant to deliver optimal sound even from unusual locations, even when you&#39;re limited by outlet locations, furniture placement or other quirks of a room&#39;s layout. The collaboration with LG brings FlexConnect to a soundbar for the first time. When the H7 soundbar is used as the lead device, the suite will bring Dolby Atmos FlexConnect audio to any television. In a future software update, LG will also bring support for Dolby Atmos FlexConnect directly to some of its premium TVs, including select 2025 models.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A report from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-china-built-its-manhattan-project-rival-west-ai-chips-2025-12-17/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Reuters</em></a> claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. <em>Reuters</em> states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.&nbsp;</p><p>EUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIiqVrKDtLc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>If confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. &quot;The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,&quot; a source told <em>Reuters</em>. &quot;China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-reportedly-has-a-prototype-euv-machine-built-by-ex-asml-employees-235833756.html?src=rss]]></description>

Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.</p><p>Under the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mattnavarra/post/DSXCACNirEt?xmt=AQF0RFIeIUKauwYgaXm8z0zs0jD3qmZqDZnvscsBxLvu0g" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">shared by</a> social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that &quot;certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/587306041_17932047504117490_7939502344875913795_n_%281%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/587306041_17932047504117490_7939502344875913795_n_%281%29.jpg" style="height:1372px;width:1170px;" alt="Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test." data-uuid="360a7da6-7fb6-4f06-a787-bb206515c17e"><figcaption>Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using &quot;professional mode&quot; on Facebook. Publishers aren&#39;t affected for now. &quot;This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>While Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it&#39;s a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/meta-verified-creators" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1">starts at</a> $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular. </p><p><strong><em>Have a tip for Karissa?

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Space is full of unsolved mysteries, and a team using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have recently turned up a doozy. &quot;I remember after we got the data down, our collective reaction was &#39;What the heck is this?&#39; It&#39;s extremely different from what we expected,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-observes-exoplanet-whose-composition-defies-explanation/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">said</a> Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington, a co-author on the study. </p><p>The researchers found an exoplanet dubbed PSR J2322-2650b that orbits a small, dense star emitting electromagnetic radiation known as a pulsar. They are an example of a black widow system, where a rapidly spinning pulsar is paired with a smaller astronomical body. A black widow duo isn’t unusual, but this pair has sparked questions about how the exoplanet originally formed. </p><p>The exoplanet&#39;s proximity to the pulsar and its intense gravitational pull have distorted it into an oblong lemon shape. More unusually, PSR J2322-2650b also has a unique atmosphere comprised mostly of helium and carbon. &quot;Instead of finding the normal molecules we expect to see on an exoplanet — like water, methane, and carbon dioxide — we saw molecular carbon,&quot; principal investigator Michael Zhang of University of Chicago said.&nbsp;Given its strange atmosphere, the team isn&#39;t certain how the exoplanet formed. &quot;It&#39;s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism,&quot; Zhang said. For now, we’ll chalk this up as another mystery of the universe.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-find-mysterious-lemon-shaped-exoplanet-with-nasas-webb-telescope-223722244.html?src=rss]]></description>

He was nominated to the post earlier this year. But days before he was scheduled for a confirmation vote, President Donald Trump <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trump-makes-a-last-minute-backtrack-on-his-pick-to-lead-nasa-153253836.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">withdrew his nomination</a>.</p><p>The reversal reportedly came after the president was told that Isaacman had donated to prominent Democrats. (Trump’s description of his decision, as based on a &quot;thorough review of prior associations,&quot; seemed to lend weight to that.) However, that was also around the time the Trump-Musk feud was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-leaves-doge-amid-tanking-tesla-sales-153859407.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">about to boil over</a>.

(That makes him something of an aberration among <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5274744/rfk-confirmation-vaccines-health-secretary" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Trump appointees in scientific fields</a>.) &quot;I am optimistic that Mr. Isaacman will bring a steady hand and clear vision to NASA,&quot; Sen. Marie Cantwell (D-WA) told <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>The new administrator has traveled to space twice on private missions. In a document published in May, Isaacman shared his three objectives for NASA. These included human missions to the Moon, Mars and deep space; helping the organization do more with a constrained budget; and cost-cutting through industry and academic partnerships.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-billboard-chart-update/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">announced</a> that it will no longer share data with Billboard for the creation of the Billboard Hot 100 and other charts because the video platform doesn&#39;t believe they&#39;re calculated fairly. The issue lies, per YouTube, with how Billboard weighs on-demand streams in its rankings: The publication weighs streams from paid music streaming services over ad-supported streams, and YouTube just so happens to run an ad-supported streaming service.</p><p>Much like getting a book on <em>The New York Times</em> Bestseller list, landing a spot on the Billboard charts doesn&#39;t carry quite the same importance that it once did. When the majority of the media people consume is digital and on-demand, sales numbers aren&#39;t a guaranteed indicator of success or popularity. That&#39;s part of the reason why Billboard started <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/billboard-hot-100-to-include-digital-streams-1050326/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">including digital streams</a> in its calculations way back in 2007, and why it announced plans to adjust how it weighs on-demand streaming just yesterday.</p><p>On Tuesday, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Billboard announced</a> that it would add more weight to streaming to &quot;better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.&quot; Billboard currently counts an &quot;album consumption unit&quot; as an album sale, which either breaks down to &quot;3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams.&quot; In the new ranking scheme that will go into effect in January 2026, &quot;each album consumption unit will now equal 2,500 ad-supported or 1,000 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The change means that it will take 33.3 percent fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20 percent fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit,&quot; Billboard says. Put another way, things are moving in YouTube’s favor, just apparently not as quickly as the company wants.</p><p>YouTube characterizes pulling its data from Billboard as fighting for fairness and equality, but it&#39;s equally connected to the platform’s demonstration of its own power. It already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/youtube-paid-out-8b-to-the-music-industry-in-12-months/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">funnels billions of dollars</a> to artists and labels from the money it makes on ads and subscriptions, but it clearly also wants the power to mint new chart-topping stars. “We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube says in its announcement. “Until then, if you&#39;re curious about what music is making waves on YouTube, you can visit our charts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://charts.youtube.com/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">here</a>.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/billboards-charts-are-increasingly-weighted-towards-on-demand-streaming-but-not-enough-for-youtube-220238291.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. For the holiday season, plenty of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have end-of-year deals live that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

This &quot;reimagined FIFA football simulation game&quot; will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, and be available to Netflix subscribers next year, right in time for FIFA World Cup 2026.</p><p>EA and FIFA maintained a nearly 30 year partnership creating soccer games before they parted ways in 2022. EA continued its soccer series afterward as EA FC, but despite being in talks with &quot;leading game publishers, media companies and investors&quot; about &quot;a major new FIFA simulation football game title for 2024,&quot; a FIFA-backed competitor has yet to materialize. Instead, FIFA has mostly supported arcade soccer games in the last few years, like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://inside.fifa.com/organisation/media-releases/mythical-games-and-fifa-team-up-to-bring-new-football-arcade-game-fifa-rivals" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>FIFA Rivals</em></a> from Mythical Games and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKWU52Et1ww" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>FIFA Heroes</em></a> from ENVER.</p><p>While the game Delphi Interactive is working on is pitched as a &quot;simulation game,&quot; based on what little detail appears in Netflix&#39;s announcement, it doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s targeting hardcore soccer fans in the same way EA&#39;s games do. Instead, this new FIFA title is designed to be &quot;a game that anyone, anywhere, can pick up and instantly feel the magic of football,&quot; according to Delphi Interactive CEO Caspar Daugaard. The game will also be designed to use a smartphone as a controller, possibly limiting how demanding or complicated gameplay can actually be.</p><p>This new FIFA game will be Delphi Interactive&#39;s second project as a studio after working on IO Interactive&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>007 First Light</em></a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to convenience, it’s hard to beat Amazon. And that rationale isn’t limited to consumers: Many local districts shopping for supplies with public funds apply the same logic. But the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ILSR-AmazonProcurementReport.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">published a study</a> earlier this month (via <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://prospect.org/2025/12/17/amazon-conning-school-districts-out-of-millions/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>The American Prospect</em></a>) that illustrates the cost of that bargain. It suggests that Amazon’s “dynamic pricing” has led many schools and other localities to overpay for supplies.</p><p>Public schools and local governments have historically bought supplies by soliciting competitive bids from local suppliers. Those vendors then respond with fixed price lists, delivery timelines and other terms. This competition — all out in the open, part of the public record — encourages low prices and transparency.</p><p>On the surface, ordering from Amazon <em>appears</em> to offer competition, too. After all, the platform includes third-party vendors fighting for your dollars. But turning taxpayer funds over to Amazon’s algorithms isn’t quite that simple. That’s because the platform’s “dynamic pricing” (algorithmically driven real-time changes) is inherently opaque.</p><p>According to the report, Amazon’s contracts with public entities don’t include fixed price lists. Instead, they include language built around swings. “This contract has a dynamic pricing structure in which the price for items listed on the online digital marketplace is driven by the market,” Amazon’s contract with Utah reads. “This contract will not need to be amended when prices fluctuate.”</p><p>Below are some examples of wild price discrepancies for these districts. All of ILSR’s examples are from localities buying supplies from Amazon Business with public funds in 2023.</p><ul><li><p>A City of Boulder, CO employee ordered a 12-pack of Sharpie markers from Amazon Business for $8.99. On the same day, a Denver Public Schools worker ordered the same markers for $28.63.</p></li><li><p>Amazon charged Clark County, WA, $146,000 for 610 computer monitors. On another day, that same order would have cost $24,000 less.</p></li><li><p>Pittsburgh Schools bought two cases of Kleenex for $57.99 each. On the same day, Denver Schools paid $36.91 for a single case.</p></li><li><p>On a single August day, Denver Schools placed two separate orders for bulk cases of dry-erase markers. One cost $114.52. The other was $149.07.</p></li><li><p>In March 2023, Denver Schools paid $15.39 for a Swingline stapler (sold by Amazon). A few days later, the same school system paid $61.87 for the same product (sold by a third-party seller).</p></li></ul><p>Even in that last example, ILSR says Amazon’s algorithms are the culprit. “It might be tempting to blame the seller for putting a $62 price tag on a stapler or the employee for not noticing the cost,” the nonprofit argues. “But that overlooks Amazon’s pivotal role in the transaction — and the profit it makes. Amazon’s algorithms steer shoppers’ attention, selecting featured products and organizing search results. The platform routinely prompts users to ‘buy it again,’ even when the price has jumped. For busy public school employees, it’s all too easy to simply click the buy button, under the assumption that Amazon is surfacing the best option.”</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/d51f6860-e4df-11ef-9fbd-65a89c2ab524" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/d51f6860-e4df-11ef-9fbd-65a89c2ab524" style="height:3885px;width:5827px;" alt="LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In total, the jurisdictions in the study spent $3 million on those items. But based on the lowest prices Amazon charged during that period, they would have paid only $2.5 million. Across those same items, one school district could have saved 17 percent (about $1 million) if it consistently received Amazon’s lowest prices.</p><p>What would fair market value have been for those items? Well, it’s hard to say because the algorithms are steering pricing silently in the background. A more thorough study that included the same items, bought exclusively through the traditional procurement method, would tell us much more. And recent history has taught us that trusting Big Tech’s algorithms to serve the public good (rather than its own bottom line) is a fool’s errand.</p><p>In at least some cases, the practice routes public funds away from local vendors and toward overseas ones — and, of course, Amazon itself. In Berkeley County, WV, the school district spent $1.3 million on Amazon Business in 2023. What portion went to sellers in the state? A measly $142.</p><p>On top of all of that, the practice has snuffed out many of the smaller vendors that traditionally competed for these contracts. “The disappearance of these small and mid-sized businesses weakens local economies and tax bases,” the report concludes. “And it leaves governments increasingly dependent on Amazon, paving the way for the kind of monopoly control that ensures higher prices, poorer service, and less innovation.”</p><p>In a statement sent to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/us-schools-amazon-algorithmic-pricing" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Amazon disputed the study’s conclusions. “Pricing research is notoriously difficult to conduct accurately and typically lacks reliable methodology, including cherry-picked product selections, mismatched product comparisons and comparing in-stock items with products out-of-stock at competitors,”</p><p>ILSR’s report drew in spending data from 128 local governments (including cities, counties and school districts) and 122 state agencies. It also gathered contract documents and interviewed public officials, procurement experts and vendors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-links-amazons-algorithmic-pricing-with-erratic-inflated-costs-for-school-districts-202047988.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Meta announced that it was opening up its VR operating system to other headset makers, starting with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-opens-quest-os-to-third-parties-including-asus-and-lenovo-163127396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ASUS and Lenovo</a>. Now, it seems that Meta is pumping the brakes on the effort and those third-party Horizon OS headsets might never actually launch.</p><p>The company has &quot;paused&quot; the program,  <em>Road to VR  </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reported</a>. Meta confirmed the move in a statement to Engadget, saying that it&#39;s instead focusing on &quot;building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market.&quot; ASUS and Lenovo didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment. Both companies have said little about the headsets since they were first announced in 2024. ASUS&#39; was going to be a &quot;performance gaming&quot; headset under its Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand, while Lenovo&#39;s was intended to be  a mixed reality device focused on &quot;productivity, learning and entertainment&quot; experiences&nbsp;</p><p>The shift isn&#39;t entirely surprising. Meta Connect was very light on virtual reality news this year as smart glasses have become a central focus for the company. Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/meta-s-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-for-metaverse-efforts" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reported</a> that Meta was planning significant cuts to the teams working on virtual reality and Horizon Worlds. The company said at the time it was &quot;shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.&quot;</p><p>Still, Meta is seemingly leaving the door open for third-party VR headsets in the future. &quot;We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for 3rd-party device partnerships as the category evolves,&quot; the company said.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Behringer is no stranger to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-01-behringer-cat-synth-octave-cat-clone.html">remaking classic synthesizers</a> and selling them at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-behringer-poly-d-stacks-four-moog-clones.html">much cheaper price points</a>. However, this latest release may just take the budget-friendly cake. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.behringer.com/behringer/product?modelCode=0722-ABS">just introduced the UB-1 Micro</a>, previously called the Spirit, a portable analog synth inspired by the Oberheim Matrix line that costs just $49.</p>
<p>Despite the price tag, this thing still manages to sound extremely beefy. It features a pair of digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) based on the Oberheim Matrix 6 analog chip.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://press.oscars.org/news/academy-partners-youtube-exclusive-global-rights-oscarsr-and-other-academy-content-starting" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> that the Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, will exclusively air on YouTube starting in 2029. The new deal means the awards show is abandoning its long-time partnership with ABC (owned by frequent Oscars heavyweight, The Walt Disney Company), though the Oscars will continue to air on the network through its 100th anniversary in 2028.</p><p>The Academy Awards will be joined by other Academy events and programming on the Oscars YouTube channel, including “the Governors Awards,&nbsp;the Oscars Nominations Announcement, the Oscars Nominees Luncheon, the Student Academy Awards, the Scientific and Technical Awards, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, film education programs, podcasts, and more,” AMPAS says. The Google Arts &amp; Culture initiative will also digitize artifacts in the Academy collection and help provide digital access online as part of the new partnership.</p><p>“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in the announcement of the new YouTube deal. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”</p><p>Awards shows have struggled to find their footing in the streaming era, particularly because they already served a niche audience even when broadcast TV was the norm. Prior to the Oscars heading to YouTube, Netflix snagged the rights to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-sag-awards-ceremony-livestream-145828446.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">stream the SAG Awards</a> in 2023, an acting-focused award show that’s often seen as a precursor to the Oscars.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-oscars-will-exclusively-air-on-youtube-starting-in-2029-181545531.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The creators of the Hitman series have honed their style of- open-ended and spectacle-driven sandboxes across several games, and now they&#39;re taking their signature immersive gameplay to the world of James Bond. With 0<em>07 First Light</em>, developer IO Interactive is crafting an origin story for the globetrotting British spy, showing how he undertook daring missions at the start of his career to eventually become the world&#39;s most infamous agent.</p><p>Before the reveal at The Game Awards of <em>007 First Light</em>&#39;s newest villain, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igTh9ud5Liw" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">played by Lenny Kravitz</a>, we had an early look at the latest bits of plot for James Bond&#39;s origin story as a superspy. We also spoke with cinematic and narrative director Martin Emborg about the main inspirations for the game, how Bond&#39;s origin taps into decades of lore, and why a good spy story is timeless.</p><p>&quot;What I think is kind of baked into doing an origin story for a character like James Bond, is that everyone knows the character and who he&#39;s going to become,&quot; Emborg said. &quot;But how does he become this character? I think that&#39;s an exciting challenge from a storytelling perspective.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt=" " data-uuid="9bb349b3-88eb-4dd4-9d47-b47218aef3b6"><figcaption>IO Interactive&#39;s James Bond is young and inexperienced.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>While some Bond films and novels have touched upon the early years of the iconic character, <em>007 First Light</em> will be the first attempt at an actual, modernized origin story. As a twenty-something new MI6 recruit, this James Bond, portrayed by Patrick Gibson, is inexperienced and brash, which can result in some operations going off the rails. He still possesses a certain cunning, and near-supernatural levels of charisma and resourcefulness. This presents a solid archetype for the game’s open-ended missions where players will explore tightly designed worlds with a multitude of tasks and objectives to handle – however the players see fit.</p><p>While IO Interactive&#39;s Hitman series taps into the spy experience, what really separates James Bond from Agent 47 is that he&#39;s a far more social character. The social element will play a big part in how players can find ways to distract, or even outright bluff through charisma to sneak into areas.. Emborg explained that James Bond&#39;s resourcefulness also makes him a compelling character for a video game, especially one that is all about player agency.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt=" " data-uuid="3ddfd955-d150-4ea8-88b4-e1bcb6486995"><figcaption>007 First Light will take players to several locations, including Slovakia and what appears to be Vietnam.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>&quot;Bond is a competent character,” Emborg said. “We want to give the player the opportunities to have that agency to say, &#39;Oh, I&#39;m gonna talk to that guy,&#39; or, &#39;I&#39;m gonna go and punch that guy,’ or, ‘I can probably crawl up into a tight space to sneak in.&#39; Having that sense of agency is pivotal if you want to deliver a full Bond experience. Obviously, the social aspect of that is important; to embed yourself and infiltrate socially is a big part of that Bond experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Emborg said the rhythm of a James Bond game is different from a Hitman title, even though espionage, infiltration and subterfuge are at the core of both.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We have a lot of experience with that from obviously making Hitman, but there are just many more gears to Bond,” he said. “Of course, the shape of this game is different. We have sandbox locations where you make the open-ended decisions, but we also have other levels where it is a chase or a set-piece encounter, and then it opens up again. So we kind of coined the term, <em>having a game that breathes</em>. It&#39;s a very different way of playing this type of game that we usually do, so we&#39;ve definitely bolstered our toolbox for this game.&quot;</p><p>In many ways, <em>007 First Light</em> is a story that can only be told in an interactive format. The new game will pull from numerous novels and films for its plot, and it also features a large cast of familiar characters seen throughout the franchise – such as MI6 assistant Moneypenny (performed by Kiera Lester), gadget guru and quartermaster Q (played by Alastair Mackenzie), and team leader M (Priyanga Burford).&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jom-jxUEqJg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>But like any singular Bond story, <em>First Light</em> features its own set of original characters. In addition to James Bond&#39;s MI6 mentor John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a new core villain, black-market smuggler and warlord Bawma, will be played by Lenny Kravitz. It&#39;s a familiar setup for a Bond experience for sure, but within the context of a video game – one made by IO Interactive – it really taps looks to tap into the Bond fantasy more than other games have.&nbsp;</p><p>From the gameplay demos and trailers we&#39;ve seen, IO Interactive looks to be channeling the style and lore from decades of Bond with its modernized reboot of the character. From deep cuts to <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> – one of the great and underrated Bond movies – and <em>You Only Live Twice</em>, <em>007 First Light</em> is keeping a keen eye on paying tribute to what came before.</p><p>&quot;At the very beginning, it was very much like a maelstrom of [ideas], then suddenly something emerges, and you build up a story around it,&quot; Emborg said. He continued, “I love doing this stuff and with great reverence for the material. It&#39;s a privilege to work in this universe. James Bond is one of the few IPs that still hasn&#39;t been overdone, in my view. We have a space to come in with a fresh take, and he&#39;s a character who&#39;s seen a lot of versions over the years.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_1.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt=" " data-uuid="64cfa0ee-db10-4b22-b01d-f6a58c0466d9"><figcaption>Confirmed MI6 gadgets include the &quot;Q-Watch.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>So far, <em>007 First Light</em> has the makings of not only the biggest Bond game but also the most true-to-life simulation of being a superspy. While previous Bond games like <em>Goldeneye </em>and <em>Everything or Nothing</em> are well-loved classics, they embody traditional video game shooting spectacle. <em>007 First Light</em> is looking to lean into the immersive element of the Hitman games in its adaptation of James Bond, finally giving players the opportunities to explore the social aspects of spy work on a grand scale.&nbsp;</p><p><em>007 First Light</em> will arrive on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Monarch Money was the runner-up in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">guide</a> to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way.</p> 
<p>All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi.

The two entities have filed a joint federal lawsuit just ahead of the ruling going into effect next month.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, many food delivery apps in the city moved the tip suggestion box to after purchases had been completed. This is sort of how rideshare apps work. It followed NYC mandating a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=df26240c-1a9f-4844-abc3-6cafebe4115a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=minimum+pay+rate+for+food+delivery+workers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzEyL255cmVnaW9uL255Yy1kZWxpdmVyeS13b3JrZXJzLW1pbmltdW0td2FnZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZjI2MjQwYy0xYTlmLTQ4NDQtYWJjMy02Y2FmZWJlNDExNWEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMTIvbnlyZWdpb24vbnljLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXdvcmtlcnMtbWluaW11bS13YWdlLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARvAzgkWS3LcMXwu2-AzMDzrlrS-em9hIjPFG1jSxRei&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F06%2F12%2Fnyregion%2Fnyc-delivery-workers-minimum-wage.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/nyregion/nyc-delivery-workers-minimum-wage.html"><ins>minimum pay rate for food delivery workers</ins></a>, the first in the country. The new law simply switches the tip suggestion box back to checkout, with a suggestion of ten percent. Customers are still free to set it to zero, if that&#39;s their thing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two companies say this law violates the First Amendment by requiring them to &quot;speak a government-mandated message.&quot; They also say the rule would cause customers to use the app less because they were suffering from &quot;tipping fatigue.&quot; As a customer of food delivery apps, I am not stricken with tipping fatigue. I have, however, come down with a serious case of &quot;what are all of these mysterious fees on my bill and why is my burrito $45?&quot; fatigue.</p>
<p>NYC food delivery workers have <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ny.eater.com/2024/1/18/24033112/delivery-apps-tipping-nyc-laws"><ins>experienced a sharp decline</ins></a> in tips since the apps switched the suggestion field to after a purchase has been completed. It&#39;s extremely easy to ignore an app notification while in a food coma on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;Removing the tipping option is to keep workers in poverty and make them depend on taking more orders,&quot; said Ligia Guallpa, co-founder of Workers Justice Project.</p>
<p>Food delivery in the city is still booming. New Yorkers spent more than $265 million on restaurant deliveries in the first half of 2025, which is up from $183 million during the same period in 2022. Current estimates suggest that there are around 80,000 delivery workers in NYC.</p>
<p>This particular law became a small part of the city&#39;s recent mayoral campaign. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oe1vnlkzkygCRnW_31ft2fjnEITEWXvN/view"><ins>said during the campaign</ins></a> that he supported giving customers the option to tip at checkout. DoorDash donated $1 million to his rival, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-and-doordash-challenge-nyc-law-that-encourages-tipping-163315375.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a month after the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">debut of Gemini 3 Pro</a> in November, Google has begun rolling out the more efficient Flash version of its latest AI model. According to the company, the new system offers similar &quot;pro-grade&quot; reasoning performance as its flagship model at a fraction of the cost, making it ideal for everyday use.&nbsp;</p><p>In benchmarks, the new system performed significantly better than Google&#39;s previous generation models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro. More notably, in Google’s testing it managed to trade blows with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">GPT-5.2</a>, the model OpenAI rushed out to counter Gemini 3 Pro.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/gemini-3-flash_final_benchmark-table_light_25-12-17_%282%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/gemini-3-flash_final_benchmark-table_light_25-12-17_%282%29.gif" style="height:1408px;width:1210px;" alt="A table comparing Gemini 3 Flash&#39;s performance across a variety of AI benchmarks.

In a handful of other benchmarks, Google&#39;s more efficient system even managed to outperform OpenAI&#39;s latest. For instance, in MMMU-Pro, a benchmark designed to test a model&#39;s multimodal understanding and reasoning, it edged out GPT-5.2 with a result of 81.2 percent compared to 79.5 percent. Of course, benchmarks only tell a partial story; we&#39;ll have to see what people think once both systems are broadly available.

A little over five weeks after the announcement of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">OP15</a>, the company is back with the OnePlus 15R, a more affordable version of its new flagship that starts at $700 (or $200 less than its sibling). Off the top, this will be a shorter review because most of what I said about the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OnePlus 15</a> also applies to the OP15R. It's a great phone that asks you to make one pretty significant compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the OnePlus 15, the 15R looks like the OnePlus 13s and 13T, a pair of smaller, 6.32-inch phones the company released in India and China this past spring. I said the design of the OP15 was boring and derivative of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The 15R has done nothing to change that opinion. With one fewer camera, the OP15R doesn't look much different from the iPhone 12 I've been hanging on to since 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I'm more fond of the 15R's mint breeze color (the phone is also available in charcoal black) than the sand storm shade of my OP15. We're big fans of minty phones here at Engadget, and OnePlus has gone with a particularly pleasing hue of the color with its new phone. With the redesign, OnePlus has also improved the phone's waterproofing, bringing it in line with the OP15. The new handset is IP69K-certified against moisture and dust, meaning it can withstand heated water shot at it at pressure. Like the OP15, the 15R trades OnePlus' old Alert Slider for a new Plus Key. It functions like the iPhone's Action button, allowing you to add a shortcut for a favorite feature. For example, you can configure it to open the camera app or act as a do not disturb toggle, among a few other options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One departure from the OP15 is that the 15R has a larger 6.83-inch display, making it slightly taller than its sibling. OnePlus is marketing this as one reason buyers might pick the 15R over the OP15, but holding the phones side by side, there's not much difference between the two. They're both big, and you'll either like that or won't.</p>
<p>On top of being big, the 15R's screen can refresh at a fast 165Hz in games. The two displays are also comparable in terms of resolution and brightness; both can push 1,800 nits of brightness. One difference I noticed is the OnePlus 15 has a warmer panel, even when the two phones are set to the same colorspace. I've reached out to OnePlus to find what might be causing the disparity, but for now it may be due to a quality control issue or oversight in the company's software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing, OnePlus has upgraded the 15R to add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor beneath the screen. This is placed in a nice spot toward the bottom third of the display, and it's fast and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OnePlus 15R is the first phone in North America to arrive with Qualcomm's latest <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-snapdragon-8-gen-5-is-a-cut-down-version-of-qualcomms-flagship-elite-chipset-063050786.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset</a>. Not to be confused with the Snapdragon Gen 5 Elite in the OP15, this new chipset is similar to Qualcomm's flagship system-on-a-chip but has a weaker CPU and GPU. This is reflected in benchmarks like Geekbench 6 where the OP15 handily outperforms the OP15R. It's not even close, either, with the OP15 delivering standout single- and multi-core scores of 3,773 and 11,293, while the 15R put up more modest results of 2,857 and 9,512.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that perspective, you're losing a fair amount of performance, but real-world use tells a different story. Outside of the handful of games such as <em>Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG</em> that support the OP15 and 15R's 165Hz displays, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 offers more than enough muscle for the majority of applications.&nbsp;Even for most games (like the ones I like to play, including <em>Diablo Immortal</em> and <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>), the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is a great match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OnePlus also hasn't skimped on the 15R's other internal components. You're still getting 12GB of LPDDR5X Ultra RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage. That's the same configuration as the base model of the OP15. This translates to a phone that doesn't miss a beat when switching between apps and loading files like images and videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15R has a slightly bigger battery, coming in at 7,400mAh, up from 7,300mAh on the OP15. In practice, the two phones offer the same amount of battery life. Putting them through both Engadget's video rundown test, they both ran for 38 hours before their batteries died (which makes sense given the OP15R has a bigger screen). Like the OP15, the 15R comes with the OnePlus 55W SUPERVOOC charger in the box. The adapter can get the 15R from dead to 100 percent in less than an hour. If you hate charging your phone, the 15R makes that process as painless as possible, with a battery that both lasts long and won't be at the outlet for hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By this point you're probably wondering what OnePlus cut from the OP15 to make the 15R more affordable. The answer — quite literally — is an entire camera. The new phone is missing a telephoto camera, something you could find on its predecessor, the OnePlus 13R. And as far as I can tell, the two remaining cameras use the same 50-megapixel and 8MP sensors OnePlus shipped on last year's model. The company also hasn't upgraded the glass on either camera. That leaves the selfie camera as the only area to see some change in the form of a sharper 32MP sensor and the addition of autofocus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b702c679-611b-45da-9084-c515bc9fd649" />
<p>Unfortunately, none of the 15R's cameras stand out. As a whole, they suffer from the same set of problems that plague the OnePlus 15's cameras. They're fine out on a sunny day, but as soon as the light becomes a bit challenging, the 15R struggles with shadow details, resulting in muddy pictures. The more I've used both the OP15 and 15R, the more I've come to the conclusion that OnePlus needs to go back to the drawing board with its new Detail Max Engine. It feels like it's holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware.</p>

<p>There's not much to say here other than the 15R ships with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/oxygenos-16-has-new-lock-screen-customization-options-and-a-novel-gemini-integration-184958404.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">OxygenOS 16</a>, just like the OP15. OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That's a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It's hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R's processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company's newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don't care about photos and videos. That's the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you're a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company's devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn't too impressed with the OP15's camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you're getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">other phones in its price range</a>, such as the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Pixel 10</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, the 15R is not as well-rounded, and can't compete with those devices in camera quality, but you're getting much better performance, battery life and a display they can't match. &nbsp; </p>

While keeping your IP address invisible, you can use your VPN to explore streaming content from all over the world or (virtually) sneak into a sports event that&#39;s not available in your area.</p><p>However, while VPNs are widely available, there&#39;s a strange dearth of information on what they actually do behind the scenes. You may know that a VPN masks your device with a proxy server to make it look like you&#39;re somewhere else, and maybe even that encryption is involved. But finding any more details can mean running a gauntlet of misinformation.</p><p>That&#39;s a shame, because the inner workings of a VPN aren&#39;t all that difficult to understand. You may not be able to build one yourself without a degree in computer science, but with a little work, you can understand exactly what it&#39;s doing on your computer. That&#39;s information you can use to select the right VPN for you, and make the most of it once you&#39;ve got it.</p><h2 id="70cde443-d9f2-456a-93b4-59c0b8e7b82a"><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></h2><p>To make sure nobody gets left behind, I&#39;ll start from the beginning. A VPN (virtual private network) is a method of securely accessing a network, either a closed network (like you might have at the office) or the internet as a whole. Initially, organizations set up VPNs so remote workers can work with secure files. While this still happens, the last 15 years have seen VPNs increasingly marketed to individuals, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="slk:Proton VPN;cpos:3;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="slk:ExpressVPN;cpos:4;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> and others seeing massive user growth.</p><p>Broadly, a VPN consists of two parts: the server, which forwards requests to your chosen destination, and the client, a piece of software that lets you interact with the server. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="slk:You can find a longer explanation here;cpos:5;pos:1">You can find a longer explanation here</a>, but I&#39;ll use the two sections below to tell you what you need to know right now.</p><p>One more note before that — there are multiple kinds of VPNs, including the remote-access VPNs and site-to-site VPNs commonly used by workplaces. However, for this article, I&#39;ll be talking mainly about the commercial VPN services sold to individuals for general security needs. Instead of a specific network, these VPNs are designed to handle all of a user&#39;s traffic to any point on the internet.</p><h2 id="5cc696a3-0830-4398-b2ce-ff2c298dab84"><strong>What happens when you use a VPN?</strong></h2><p>First, you use the client to connect to a server — either the fastest one available or a particular location you need. Once you&#39;ve connected, every request you send to the internet goes through the VPN server first. This communication between your device and the web is encrypted so it can&#39;t be traced back to you.</p><p>The VPN server decrypts your requests and sends them on. The destination then communicates with the VPN server, which relays the information back to you — after re-encrypting it so nobody follows it home.</p><p>Since the VPN does everything on your behalf, it&#39;s your &quot;mask&quot; online. Your internet service provider (ISP) and third parties can see what&#39;s being done, but — so long as you’re not otherwise logged in or identifying yourself — nobody knows that it&#39;s you doing it. It&#39;s like having a friend order pizza for you so the pizzeria doesn&#39;t hear you calling for the third time this week (not that I speak from experience).</p><h2 id="3fc61835-654b-42ae-b891-e1a638f125af"><strong>What&#39;s the point of using a VPN?</strong></h2><p>Why add an extra step to the already complex process of getting online? The two biggest reasons are maintaining anonymity and changing your virtual location. I&#39;ve already explained how a VPN keeps you anonymous. Among other things, this prevents your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers and protects activists who face government repercussions for what they do online.</p><p>Changing your virtual location is part of masking, but it can also be used to see the internet as it&#39;s visible in other countries. Streaming services are frequently limited to certain places, and almost all of them change the available content based on their licenses in each nation. You can also use a VPN in a country with a nationwide firewall, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-05-fan-bingxi-great-firewall-of-china.html" data-i13n="slk:like China;cpos:6;pos:1">like China</a>, to see forbidden outside information sources.</p><h2 id="6e0d3680-d238-4f09-9c70-12192098a2bf"><strong>How does a VPN work? The full technical explanation</strong></h2><p>Most online explanations stop after defining a VPN as an anonymous agent between you and the internet — but I wrote this article to go a little bit deeper. To understand what a VPN is doing on a technical level, we&#39;ll need to cover how the internet works, how the VPN knows where to send encrypted information and just what &quot;encryption&quot; actually is.</p><h3 id="02caaf09-a724-4593-b963-d8b790c505c1"><strong>How the internet transmits data</strong></h3><p>When you&#39;re not using a VPN, internet traffic goes directly from your modem to your ISP, then on to your chosen destination. The key technologies here are IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, and TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. They&#39;re usually combined as TCP/IP.</p><p>You may have heard that every online device has an IP address that identifies it to every other device. TCP/IP governs not just those names but how data moves between them. Here&#39;s how it works, step-by-step.</p><ol><li><p>You click a link or enter a URL into your web browser.</p></li><li><p>Your computer sends a request to your modem, asking to see the page associated with the URL. Your modem forwards the request to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>Your ISP finds a domain name server (DNS) that tells it which IP address is connected to the URL you asked to see. It then sends the request to that IP address along the fastest available route, which will involve being relayed between several nodes.</p></li><li><p>That IP address is connected with a server that holds the content you&#39;re looking for. Once it receives the request, it breaks the data down into small packets of about 1 to 1.5 kilobytes.</p></li><li><p>These packets separate to find their own fastest routes back to your ISP, your modem and finally your web browser, which reassembles them.</p></li><li><p>You see a web page, likely no more than a second after you asked for it.</p></li></ol><p>The outgoing requests and inbound packets are key to understanding VPN function. A VPN intervenes during step 2 (when your modem contacts your ISP) and step 5 (when your ISP sends the packets back to you). In the next section, I&#39;ll explain exactly what it does during those steps.</p><h3 id="4bfdc75a-e03c-4367-9846-9aa3f1bf8c98"><strong>How VPN tunneling protects data</strong></h3><p>You might have heard a VPN&#39;s activities described as &quot;tunneling.&quot; That term refers to a figurative tunnel being created between your device and the VPN. Data enters the tunnel when it&#39;s encrypted by the VPN client and exits when it&#39;s decrypted by the VPN server. Between those two points, encryption means nobody can see the true data. It&#39;s as though it&#39;s traveling through an opaque tunnel.</p><p>While the tunnel is a useful metaphor, it may be better to think of VPN encryption as an encapsulation. Each packet of data sent via VPN is &quot;wrapped&quot; in a second packet, which both encrypts the original packet and contains information for reaching the VPN server. However, none of these outer layers have the complete path — each just knows enough to reach the next relay. In this way, the origin point (that&#39;s you) remains invisible.</p><p>The same thing happens when the internet returns content to show you. Your ISP sends the data to the VPN server, because, as far as it knows, that&#39;s where the request came from. The VPN then encrypts each packet and sends them back to you for decryption and reassembly. It takes a little longer with the extra steps; that&#39;s why VPNs always slightly slow down your browsing speed, though the best ones don&#39;t do that by much (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="slk:Surfshark;cpos:7;pos:1">Surfshark</a> is currently the fastest).</p><p>You learned in that last section that two protocols, IP and TCP (usually combined as TCP/IP), are responsible for letting online devices talk to each other, even if they&#39;ve never connected before. In the same way, a VPN protocol is like a shared language that lets VPNs encrypt, move and decrypt information. See the next section to learn how a VPN protocol works in detail.</p><h3 id="795a93d9-5500-4c8a-b5a1-fcfde25c4ccd"><strong>How VPN protocols encrypt data</strong></h3><p>VPN protocols are the technology behind VPNs; every other feature of your VPN is just a method of interacting with them. All protocols are designed to encrypt data packets and wrap them in a second layer that includes information on where to send them. The main differences are the shape of that second layer, the types of encryption used and how the client establishes its initial secure connection with the server.</p><p>It&#39;s extremely common for VPNs to advertise protocols with &quot;bank-grade&quot; or &quot;military-grade&quot; encryption. This is talking about the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is used by financial institutions and the US government and military. AES-256 is indeed some of the strongest available encryption, but it&#39;s only part of the story. As a symmetric algorithm, it&#39;s not fully secure on its own, because the same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt it — and those keys can be stolen.</p><p>For that reason, most VPN protocols use AES-256 (or a similarly strong cipher like ChaCha20) to encrypt the data packets themselves, then combine it with a larger suite of multiple encryption algorithms. One of the most reliable and popular protocols, OpenVPN, uses the asymmetric TLS protocol to establish a secure relationship between client and server, then transmits packets encrypted with AES-256 across that channel, knowing the keys will be safe.</p><p>Explaining this could easily reach the length of a book, but the basic principle isn&#39;t complicated. In asymmetric encryption, a sender encodes data with a unique key, then a recipient decodes it with a different paired key. The keys are provided by a trusted third party. In a maneuver called a TLS handshake, the server and client send each other encrypted data. If each can decode the other&#39;s test data, they know they have a matched pair of keys, which proves that both are the same client and server that got the keys from the trusted authority.</p><p>Why not just use asymmetric encryption for the data itself, if it&#39;s more secure? Mainly, protocols don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s a lot slower. Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of resource-heavy math that makes connections drag. That&#39;s why OpenVPN and others use the asymmetric-to-symmetric two-step instead.</p><p>To summarize, a VPN protocol is a complex set of instructions and tools that control encryption and routing via VPN servers. Protocols still in use include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, SSTP and L2TP. PPTP, one of the oldest protocols, is no longer considered secure. On top of these, VPNs often build their own proprietary protocols, such as ExpressVPN&#39;s Lightway.</p><h2 id="194fe0d7-96f6-4022-bc10-fa63aa7f4be1"><strong>Putting it all together</strong></h2><p>Now that we&#39;ve hit all the relevant information, let&#39;s revisit that step-by-step from earlier, this time with a VPN in the mix. Here are the steps, starting with establishing the VPN connection and ending with anonymously viewing a website.</p><ol><li><p>You open your VPN client, choose a server location and connect. The VPN client and server authenticate each other with a TLS handshake.</p></li><li><p>The client and server exchange the symmetric keys they&#39;ll use to encrypt and decrypt packets for the duration of this session (i.e. until you disconnect). Your VPN client tells you that it&#39;s established a secure tunnel.</p></li><li><p>You open your web browser and enter a URL. Your browser sends a request to view the content at that address.</p></li><li><p>The request goes to your VPN client, which encrypts it and adds an outer layer of information with directions to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The encrypted request reaches the VPN server, which decrypts it and forwards it to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>As normal, your ISP finds the IP address associated with the URL you entered and forwards your request along.</p></li><li><p>The destination server receives the request and sends all the necessary packets of information back to your ISP, which forwards it to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The VPN server encrypts each packet and adds a header directing it to the VPN client.</p></li><li><p>The client decrypts the packets and forwards them to your web browser.</p></li><li><p>You see the web page you opened.</p></li></ol><p>Because of the encrypted tunnel, the request arrives at the VPN server without any information on where it came from. Thus, the VPN doesn&#39;t actually encrypt your activity on the websites themselves — for the most part, the HTTPS protocol does that. Instead, a VPN gives you a false name to put in the register, with no information that could be traced back to your real identity.</p><h2 id="6588ec1f-d408-4bde-bda5-ba8ecd56620e"><strong>How to use this information</strong></h2><p>Now that you know how a VPN works on a technical level, you&#39;re better equipped to choose one for yourself. You can cut through marketing hype statements like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Military-grade encryption!&quot; (It&#39;s the same algorithm everybody uses)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Stay completely anonymous online!&quot; (Plaintext you post on social media is not encrypted)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Dodge ISP throttling!&quot; (If your ISP is throttling you based on your IP address, this works — but if you&#39;re being slowed down because of your moment-to-moment activity, your identity doesn&#39;t matter)</p></li></ul><p>A VPN is just one important part of a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html" data-i13n="slk:complete cybersecurity breakfast;cpos:8;pos:1">complete cybersecurity breakfast</a>. While hiding your IP address, make sure to also use strong passwords, download updates immediately and remain alert for social engineering tactics.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss]]></description>
