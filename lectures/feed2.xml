                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has steadily expanded the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Apple Watch’s</a> health monitoring features over the years, moving beyond fitness tracking into areas that can offer early insight into potential medical concerns. One of the most recent additions is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-clearance-for-hypertension-alerts-120046138.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">hypertension alerts</a>, which are designed to notify users when their blood pressure trends are elevated over time. While Apple Watches cannot directly measure blood pressure, this feature can still play a useful role in highlighting patterns that may be worth discussing with your doctor. Here, we’ll explain what hypertension alerts do, how they work and how to enable and manage them on the Apple Watch.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-hypertension-alerts-do">What hypertension alerts do</h2><p>Hypertension alerts are designed to identify long-term trends that may indicate elevated blood pressure. Instead of relying on a traditional cuff measurement, the Apple Watch analyzes a combination of health data collected over a 30-day period, including heart rate, movement patterns and other contextual information stored in the Health app. Using this data, the system looks for sustained changes that align with patterns commonly associated with hypertension.</p><p>If your Apple Watch detects a trend suggesting elevated blood pressure over an extended period, it’ll send you a notification. These alerts are not intended to diagnose hypertension or replace medical testing. Instead, they serve as an early signal that something may have changed and that you may want to seek further monitoring or professional advice.</p><p>Apple emphasizes that hypertension alerts are designed for users who have not already been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Instead, they are meant to raise awareness rather than confirm a condition.</p><h2 id="jump-link-who-can-use-hypertension-alerts">Who can use hypertension alerts</h2><p>Hypertension alerts require a compatible Apple Watch model (Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later) paired with a supported iPhone (iPhone 11 or later). The feature also depends on recent versions of watchOS and iOS, as it relies on updated health algorithms and background data analysis.  To use hypertension alerts you must be 22 years of age or older, not be pregnant and not have been diagnosed with hypertension. You also need to ensure that your Apple Watch’s <strong>Wrist Detection</strong> feature is turned on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To receive meaningful alerts, your Apple Watch needs sufficient data. This means wearing the watch regularly, including during sleep if sleep tracking is enabled, and keeping health details such as age, sex, height and weight up-to-date in the Health app. The system uses long-term trends, so alerts will not appear immediately after enabling the feature.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-on-hypertension-alerts">How to turn on hypertension alerts</h2><p>Hypertension alerts are managed through the <strong>Health app</strong> on the paired iPhone. The feature cannot be enabled directly from the watch itself. During setup, the Health app will ask for confirmation that the user has not been diagnosed with hypertension. It may also prompt a review of health details such as date of birth and biological sex, as this information helps improve the accuracy of trend analysis.</p><p>To get started, open the <strong>Health app</strong> on the iPhone paired with the Apple Watch. From the main Health screen, tap your profile in the top corner. Select <strong>Health Checklist</strong> from the available <strong>Features</strong>. Next, you’ll need to tap <strong>Hypertension Notifications</strong>, confirm your age and whether or not you’ve ever been diagnosed with hypertension.<strong> </strong>Tap<strong> Continue </strong>and<strong> </strong>follow the on-screen prompts for information on how the notifications work. Once you have done this, tap <strong>Done </strong>and you’ll be all set.&nbsp;</p><p>Once enabled, the feature runs automatically in the background. There is no need to manually start monitoring or interact with the feature daily.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/2b414990-8da3-11f0-b7fb-94b994b5094e" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/2b414990-8da3-11f0-b7fb-94b994b5094e" style="height:1350px;width:2400px;" alt="The new apple watch series 11 can help identify hypertension" data-uuid="3fa2b898-4a14-3ca6-9af3-e2041afe4a93"/><figcaption>The new apple watch series 11 can help identify hypertension</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2 id="jump-link-managing-notifications-and-alerts">Managing notifications and alerts</h2><p>When hypertension alerts are turned on, notifications appear on both the Apple Watch and the paired iPhone. These alerts typically explain that a long-term trend suggesting elevated blood pressure has been detected, along with guidance on next steps.</p><p>Users can manage how and when these notifications appear by adjusting notification settings for the Health app. This includes choosing whether alerts appear on the lock screen, in Notification Center or as time-sensitive notifications on Apple Watch.</p><p>Health data related to hypertension alerts can be reviewed at any time in the Health app. While Apple Watch does not display a specific blood pressure number, users can view contextual information and educational material explaining what the alert means and what actions may be appropriate.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-hypertension-alerts-can-help">How hypertension alerts can help</h2><p>Hypertension often develops gradually and may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Because of this, many people are unaware of elevated blood pressure until it is identified during a routine medical check.</p><p>Hypertension alerts can let you know of subtle changes that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. For some users, an alert may prompt earlier conversations with a doctor, additional blood pressure monitoring at home or lifestyle changes such as adjustments to diet, activity or sleep habits.</p><p>It is important to treat these notifications as informational rather than diagnostic. Apple Watch does not provide specific blood pressure readings and cannot confirm hypertension on its own.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-to-do-if-you-receive-an-alert">What to do if you receive an alert</h2><p>Receiving a hypertension alert does not mean that there is an immediate medical emergency. Apple recommends using the alert as a prompt to pay closer attention to your cardiovascular health.</p><p>Many users choose to follow up by measuring blood pressure using a traditional cuff at home or by scheduling a check with a healthcare professional. A doctor can provide proper testing, diagnosis and guidance based on clinical measurements and individual risk factors.</p><p>It is also worth reviewing lifestyle factors that can influence blood pressure, such as physical activity levels, sleep quality, stress and diet. Apple Watch can already help track many of these areas, which may provide useful context when discussing health concerns with a professional.</p><h2 id="jump-link-limitations-to-keep-in-mind">Limitations to keep in mind</h2><p>Hypertension alerts are not available in all regions and may be subject to regulatory approval. The feature also requires consistent Apple Watch use over time to generate reliable trend data.</p><p>Most importantly, the Apple Watch does not measure blood pressure directly. The alerts are based on correlations and trends rather than direct readings, which means they should not be used as a substitute for medical equipment or professional care.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-turn-on-hypertension-alerts-on-apple-watch-130000090.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. There are tons of interesting games out this week. But first, there&#39;s been some discourse around the Nintendo Switch version of <em>Dispatch</em>, which arrived this week as well.</p><p>On other platforms, there&#39;s an option to censor genitalia and other explicit content, but that&#39;s not present in the Switch version. Instead, such content is censored by default, with black rectangles <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/dispatch-switch-2-review/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">covering up characters&#39; bits</a> and someone flipping the bird. Noises that suggest sexual pleasure are said to be toned down too.</p><p>&quot;We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,&quot; developer AdHoc told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>EuroGamer</em></a>. Nintendo later said in a statement to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>GoNintendo</em></a> that it &quot;requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>There are other games available for the Switch and Switch 2 that feature nudity and explicit content. There have long been hentai games on the eShop, while mainstream games like <em>The Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-glitch-penis-breasts-170449946.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">we know all about the dongs in that one</a>) still include explicit content on Nintendo platforms. So it&#39;s a bit of a strange one, and AdHoc and Nintendo didn&#39;t exactly clear things up with their statements. </p><p>There&#39;s been speculation that AdHoc censored the game to comply with rules in Japan (<em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-cyberpunk-2077-will-be-censored-in-japan/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">censored there</a> too) and that it opted to have just one version of the game available globally on Nintendo platforms. All the same, it&#39;s a curious situation that&#39;s resulted in a lot of discourse. But there&#39;s been another indie game that&#39;s been a source of even more chatter this week...</p><h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqFccBZyTaA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Highguard </em>is a 3v3 raid shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a team that includes a bunch of&nbsp;former <em>Apex Legends </em>and <em>Titanfall </em>developers. It <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">broke cover at The Game Awards</a> in December when it was the final reveal of the night but that first trailer wasn&#39;t great. </p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">As it turned out</a>, TGA creator and host Geoff Keighley was a friend of the devs and after trying <em>Highguard</em>, he wanted to include it in the show. Wildlight cobbled together a trailer, but that disrupted the studio&#39;s long-standing plans to reveal and release the game simultaneously — a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-04-apex-legends-battle-royale-game-now-available-respawn-titanfall.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">strategy</a> that worked wonders for <em>Apex Legends </em>(though that game had the might of EA behind it).</p><p>After revealing <em>Highguard</em>, Wildlight effectively went radio silent until a release day showcase on Monday to detail just what the game is and how it works. That seems to have been a mistake given the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/highguard-deserves-a-chance-so-dont-kill-it-out-of-spite/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">review bombing</a> and strange vendetta some developed against it. <em>Highguard</em> went live on Monday and Wildlight published a whole bunch of YouTube videos revealing the game&#39;s features. Spreading those out between TGA and this week could have tempered expectations.</p><p>In any case, I&#39;ve played a few rounds of <em>Highguard</em> and mostly enjoyed my time with it so far. It&#39;s a blend of hero shooter and MOBA. As you might expect for a game from <em>Apex </em>and <em>Titanfall </em>veterans, the weapons feel well-tuned and the gunplay is snappy. There’s a lot going on and the maps are far too big for just six players. It&#39;s fun enough, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a game that&#39;s going to break my <em>Overwatch </em>obsession. Riding into battle on the back of a bear feels pretty great, though.

I just wish it was as fun to play as it is to look at and listen to.</p><p>The visual clutter and fast pace sometimes makes it hard to spot enemies and the narrative doesn&#39;t really hang together, as much as the developers have salient points to make about the exploitation of finite resources. The core gameplay idea here is that the faster you move, the more damage you deal and more you heal. The game has its own take on a bunny hop called a wave hop that boosts your speed, but felt like it slowed me down because of the complex combination of inputs (jump, ground pound, jump, dash). That also caused my hand to cramp up very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>I do love the customization here. Slapping rhinestones and baby sharks onto my weapons was delightful. The game&#39;s take on a gravity gun is fun too.

This week, it revealed gameplay for its first title, <em>Darkhaven</em>, which is a fantasy isometric action RPG in the vein of (you guessed it) Diablo. You&#39;ll be able to play this one solo or with friends, and there are PvP elements. <em>Darkhaven</em> has procedurally generated, destructible worlds along with &quot;massive events that threaten your entire world.&quot;</p><p>The gameplay shown in the trailer looks a bit rough, but it&#39;s still early days.

You&#39;ll alter the level layouts by pushing boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>This one from Dumen Games has an intriguing premise.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2021, NASA&#39;s Perseverance rover has achieved a number of historic milestones, including sending back the first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/perseverance-driving-on-mars-sounds-063118359.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">audio recordings from Mars</a>. Now, nearly five years after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/perseverance-lands-on-mars-205800998.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">landing on the Red Planet</a>, it just achieved another feat. This past December, Perseverance successfully completed a route through a section of  the Jezero crater <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-perseverance-rover-completes-first-ai-planned-drive-on-mars/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">plotted by Anthropic&#39;s Claude chatbot</a>, marking the first time NASA has used a large language model to pilot the car-sized robot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between December 8 and 10, Perseverance drove approximately 400 meters (about 437 yards) through a field of rocks on the Martian surface mapped out by Claude. As you might imagine, using an AI model to plot a course for Perseverance wasn&#39;t as simple as inputting a single prompt.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QtS85SRnOE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>As NASA explains, routing Perseverance is no easy task, even for a human. &quot;Every rover drive needs to be carefully planned, lest the machine slide, tip, spin its wheels, or get beached,&quot; NASA said. &quot;So ever since the rover landed, its human operators have painstakingly laid out waypoints — they call it a &#39;breadcrumb trail&#39; — for it to follow, using a combination of images taken from space and the rover’s onboard cameras.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>To get Claude to complete the task, NASA had to first provide <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-launches-claude-cowork-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000849.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Claude Code</a>, Anthropic&#39;s programming agent, with the &quot;years&quot; of contextual data from the rover before the model could begin writing a route for Perseverance. Claude then went about the mapping process methodically, stringing together waypoints from ten-meter segments it would later critique and iterate on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This being NASA we&#39;re talking about, engineers from the agency&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made sure to double check the model&#39;s work before sending it to Perseverance. The JPL team ran Claude&#39;s waypoints through a simulation they use every day to confirm the accuracy of commands sent to the rover. In the end, NASA says it only had to make &quot;minor changes&quot; to Claude&#39;s route, with one tweak coming as a result of the fact the team had access to ground-level images Claude hadn&#39;t seen in its planning process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LO2GluKu4C8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;The engineers estimate that using Claude in this way will cut the route-planning time in half, and make the journeys more consistent,&quot; NASA said. &quot;Less time spent doing tedious manual planning — and less time spent training — allows the rover’s operators to fit in even more drives, collect even more scientific data, and do even more analysis. It means, in short, that we’ll learn much more about Mars.&quot;</p><p>While the productivity gains offered by AI are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">often overstated</a>, in the case of NASA, any tool that could allow its scientists to be more efficient is sure to be welcome. Over the summer, the agency <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-may-lose-close-to-4000-employees-after-latest-deferred-resignation-round-204452249.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">lost about 4,000 employees</a> – accounting for about 20 percent of its workforce – due to Trump administration cuts. Going into 2026, the president had proposed gutting the agency&#39;s science budget by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trumps-defunding-of-nasa-would-be-catastrophic-153053020.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">nearly half</a> before Congress ultimately <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/senate-passes-minibus-bill-funding-nasa-rejecting-trumps-proposed-cuts-231605536.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">rejected that plan in early January</a>. Still, even with its funding preserved just below 2025 levels, the agency has a tough road ahead. It&#39;s being asked to return to the Moon with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.planetary.org/charts/nasa-workforce-chart" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">less than half the workforce</a> it had during the height of the Apollo program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For Anthropic, meanwhile, this is a major feat. You may recall last spring Claude <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-isnt-a-great-pokemon-player-and-thats-okay-151522448.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">couldn&#39;t even beat <em>Pokémon Red</em></a>. In less than a year, the company&#39;s models have gone from struggling to navigate a simple 8-bit Game Boy game to successfully plotting a course for a rover on a distant planet. NASA is excited about the possibility of future collaborations, saying &quot;autonomous AI systems could help probes explore ever more distant parts of the solar system.&quot;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nasa-used-claude-to-plot-a-route-for-its-perseverance-rover-on-mars-203150701.html?src=rss]]></description>

The custom “vanbulance” serves a dual purpose: preventing on-set exhaust fumes (which could harm the cast and crew) and integrating a green storyline. “As an added benefit, the elimination of engine noise brought a welcome quiet while cameras were rolling,” Rivan wrote in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://stories.rivian.com/greys-anatomy-vanbulance-rivian-commercial-van" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">blog post</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/rivian_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/rivian_2.jpg" style="height:2044px;width:3408px;" alt="View of an ambulance interior for a Hollywood set" data-uuid="4985ae5d-254f-4fa9-ada9-98956d7a52f4"/><figcaption>Among other modifications, it has rear double doors instead of a roll-up one.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rivian</div></figure><p>The vehicle includes some production-specific touches. Its walls and roof panels are removable, allowing cameras to reach angles required for interior shots. In addition, Rivian replaced the standard van’s rear roll-up door with double doors while adding a side entry to the cargo area. The company also added custom lighting and an exterior wrap reading “Seattle Emergency Response Services.”</p><p>The team consulted with the Huntington Beach Fire Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department to inform the interior layout. “Their feedback was invaluable to understand how first responders actually use their vehicles,” Rivian wrote.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/imgi_16_cover-1769725585.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/imgi_16_cover-1769725585.jpg" style="height:2200px;width:3300px;" alt="An electric ambulance used on a Hollywood set" data-uuid="6931e57a-fbdd-4de4-90cf-d14e08d7f8b9"/><figcaption>At least Hollywood&#39;s fictional worlds are transitioning to electric.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rivian</div></figure><p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/greys-anatomy-electric-ambulance-season-22-1236488768/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">notes</a> that the electric ambulance debuted in the November 13, 2025, episode of <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>.

Samsung isn&#39;t changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it&#39;ll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.</p><p>The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2026/01/galaxy-s26-ultra-will-look-more-premium-than-the-s25-ultra.html" data-i13n="slk:According to Android Headlines;cpos:14;pos:1">According to <em>Android Headlines</em></a>, the new phone&#39;s cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish.

It’s what’s known as a world world, an AI system capable of generating images and reacting as the user moves through the environment the software is simulating. At the time, DeepMind positioned Genie 3 as a tool for training AI agents. Now, it’s making the model available to people outside of Google to try with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/project-genie/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Project Genie</a>. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YxkGdX4WIBE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>To start, you’ll need Google’s $250 per month AI Ultra plan to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">check out Project Genie</a>. You’ll also need to live in the US and be 18 years or older. At launch, Project Genie offers three different modes of interaction: World Sketching, exploration and remixing. The first sees Google’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Nano Banana Pro</a> model generating the source image Genie 3 will use to create the world you will later explore. At this stage, you can describe your character, define the camera perspective — be it first-person, third-person or isometric — and how you want to explore the world Genie 3 is about to generate. Before you can jump into the model’s creation, Nano Banana Pro will “sketch” what you’re about to see so you can make tweaks. It’s also possible to write your own prompts for worlds others have used Genie to generate. </p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that Genie 3 is not a game engine. While its outputs can look game-like, and it can simulate physical interactions, there aren’t traditional game mechanics here. Generations are also limited to 60 seconds, as is the presentation, which is capped at 24 frames per second and 720p. Still, if you’re an AI Ultra subscriber, this is a cool opportunity to see the bleeding edge of what DeepMind has been working over the past couple of years.         </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-project-genie-lets-you-create-your-own-3d-interactive-worlds-183646428.html?src=rss]]></description>

You&#39;ll also find deals on the flagship Arc Ultra Soundbar, Sonos subwoofers, and more.</p> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html">Sonos Beam</a> is the company&#39;s sub-$500 soundbar. Engadget&#39;s pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html">best midrange model</a>, the compact speaker has impressive sound for its size. Part of that is its Dolby Atmos support. Although the soundbar lacks upward-firing speakers, it uses software tricks to compensate. Audio timing and frequency adjustments make sound seem to come from the side or slightly above.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>One of the biggest drawbacks is that the Beam only has one HDMI port. Regardless, that compromise may be easier to accept at Beam&#39;s current $369 than at its usual $499.</p> 
<p>Several more home theater speakers are included in Sonos&#39;s sale.

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you&#39;ll see the biggest discount: it&#39;s $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/save-up-to-81-percent-on-expressvpn-two-year-plans-right-now-180602273.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When talking about the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPNs</a>, I frequently warn about the dangers of trusting free VPNs without verifying them. Although there are a few free VPNs worth recommending, many other free providers are ineffective, malicious or looking to profit off their users (or sometimes all three). Even the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best free VPNs</a> work a lot better once you subscribe and access their full service.<br><br>This can be frustrating if you want to enjoy the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">benefits of a VPN</a> but don&#39;t have the budget for yet another subscription. To help you out, I put together a list of the best paid VPN services you can get cheaply. Every name on the list comes with my full recommendation — I&#39;ll never recommend a VPN that doesn&#39;t protect you, no matter how affordable.<br><br>Before I get started, I want to define &quot;cheap,&quot; since VPNs often bamboozle the customer with muddled pricing schemes. Most providers have long-term subscription plans with big discounts, and many of them compensate by making their monthly plans more expensive. On this list, I&#39;ll recommend services with cheap subscriptions for both the short and long term, plus one favorite that balances both.</p>

<p>A couple of VPNs have decent pricing options attached to worthy services but weren&#39;t quite strong enough to make the list. Both these services get my hearty recommendation; they&#39;re just hard to justify as &quot;cheap.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-expressvpn"><strong>ExpressVPN</strong></h3>
<p>ExpressVPN recently switched to a multi-tier pricing model. The Basic pricing tier gets you complete VPN service but doesn&#39;t include the full set of features. The best price on that is $78.18 for 28 months, which works out to $2.79 per month. Although that sounds great, it&#39;s more expensive than both Surfshark and CyberGhost at the same duration and renews at the even higher price of $99.95 per year ($8.33 per month).</p>
<p>Still, as I wrote in my full <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">ExpressVPN review</a>, it&#39;s an outstanding service overall. Thanks to its sensible app layouts and focus on doing simple tasks well, I find it especially good for introducing beginners to what a VPN can do.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-nordvpn"><strong>NordVPN</strong></h3>
<p>NordVPN is another provider that I gave a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">relatively positive review</a>. I really like its boundary-pushing features, especially the various types of highly specialized servers. Its pricing isn&#39;t bad, exactly, but even the Basic level is more expensive than just about everyone else at every duration. NordVPN&#39;s fast download speeds and wide server network make it worthwhile for lots of users, but it&#39;s hard to recommend to people on a budget.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-good-cheap-vpn"><strong>What to look for in a good cheap VPN</strong></h2>
<p>Looking for an affordable VPN is the same as looking for any kind of VPN; it just requires more care. The worst VPNs usually present themselves as free, but there&#39;s also a fair number of mediocre options that think low prices have to mean a mediocre service. If you want to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">use a VPN</a> but don&#39;t have much extra cash, take some additional care in a few areas of your search.</p>
<p>First, don&#39;t subscribe to a VPN — or even download any of its apps — if you haven&#39;t verified its security. To do that, start by checking what experts have to say about it. If a VPN is truly unsafe, chances are high that somebody has already sounded the alarm. You can also check the list of protocols the VPN offers. If it&#39;s anything other than OpenVPN, WireGuard or IKEv2, do a deep dive to make sure it&#39;s using worthwhile encryption.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve verified that the VPN isn&#39;t a virus, check to see if it has a free trial or a guaranteed money-back period. This will give you some risk-free time to do hands-on tests. Our article on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">how we test VPNs</a> includes several tests you can run on your own computer, phone or tablet. Check the VPN&#39;s speed, make sure it has the server locations you need and look for anything that might be leaking your real IP address.</p>
<p>Read the VPN&#39;s privacy policy and make sure you&#39;re comfortable with how much information it saves. Some VPNs emphasize privacy more than others. Finally, before your free trial or refund period expires, make sure to double-check on the pricing structure of the VPN you&#39;re choosing — it&#39;s possible that it will only be cheap for the first subscription period.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-cheap-vpn-170000957.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Fallout</em>’s second season is coming to a close, and it’s been well <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html"><ins>worth</ins></a> the wait. But if a reluctance to add yet another subscription to your <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming</a> rotation means you haven’t watched Amazon’s surprisingly excellent adaptation yet, you might be interested to know that the company is currently releasing season one for free on the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@PrimeVideo"><ins>Prime Video</ins></a> YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Whether driven by Amazon wanting even more people to watch what has become one of its biggest TV <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://movieweb.com/fallout-season-2-streaming-viewership-update-prime-video/"><ins>success</ins></a> stories, or a move that speaks to how few people are actually signed up for Prime Video, it’s good news for anyone who hasn’t seen the show yet. <em>Fallout</em>’s first season did a great job of taking everything that’s great about the long-running post-apocalyptic RPG series and weaving it into a wildly entertaining live-action show, elevated by excellent performances from Ella Purnell as a hopelessly naive but endearingly optimistic vault-dweller, and Walton Goggins as the Ghoul.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon is currently adding a new episode each day ahead of next week’s season two finale, presumably hoping a whole new set of fans hop straight into that once they’re done. But here’s the catch: you only have until February 11 to watch the whole lot. After that, the show will be for Prime Video subscribers only once again.</p>
<p>And that isn&#39;t the the only Fallout freebie up for grabs right now. Between now and February 5, Bethesda’s MMORPG, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/freeplay"><em><ins>Fallout 76</ins></em></a>, is free-to-play on Xbox and PC, while PlayStation players have until February 4. <em>Fallout 76 </em>first launched in 2018, and as a fully multiplayer-focused game it represented a new direction for the series. It was, to put it bluntly, a bit of a mess for quite a while, but Bethesda has never abandoned the title or its player-base, and if you have Fallout on the brain, this is the perfect opportunity to see how it’s looking in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-first-season-of-amazons-fallout-show-is-now-free-on-youtube-162920615.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said it received more than 1 million reports of AI-related child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in 2025. The &quot;vast majority&quot; of that content was reported by Amazon, which found the material in its training data, according to an investigation by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-29/amazon-found-child-sex-abuse-in-ai-training-data" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. In addition, Amazon said only that it obtained the inappropriate content from external sources used to train its AI services and claimed it could not provide any further details about where the CSAM came from.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon provided Engadget with the following statement to explain why it doesn’t have data that can provide any further action on the </p><p><em>“When we set up this reporting channel in 2024, we informed NCMEC that we would not have sufficient information to create actionable reports, because of the third-party nature of the scanned data. The separate channel ensures that these reports would not dilute the efficacy of our other reporting channels. Because of how this data is sourced, we don&#39;t have the data that comprises an actionable report.”</em></p><p>&quot;This is really an outlier,&quot; Fallon McNulty, executive director of NCMEC’s CyberTipline, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. The CyberTipline is where many types of US-based companies are legally required to report suspected CSAM. “Having such a high volume come in throughout the year begs a lot of questions about where the data is coming from, and what safeguards have been put in place.” She added that aside from Amazon, the AI-related reports the organization received from other companies last year included actionable data that it could pass along to law enforcement for next steps. Since Amazon isn’t disclosing sources, McNulty said its reports have proved “inactionable.”</p><p>Amazon provided Engadget with these additional details, which were first reported in <em>Bloomberg</em>:</p><p><em>“Amazon is committed to preventing CSAM across all of its businesses, and we are not aware of any instances of our models generating CSAM. In accordance with our commitments to responsible AI and the Generative AI Principles to Prevent Child Abuse, we take a deliberately cautious approach to scanning foundation model training data, including data from the public web, to identify and remove known CSAM and protect our customers. While our proactive safeguards cannot provide the same detail in NCMEC reports as consumer-facing tools, we stand by our commitment to responsible AI and will continue our work to prevent CSAM.”</em></p><p>The company also reiterated that “we intentionally use an over-inclusive threshold for scanning, which yields a high percentage of false positives” to explain the high volume of content the company reported.</p><p>Safety questions for minors have emerged as a critical concern for the artificial intelligence industry in recent months. CSAM has skyrocketed in NCMEC&#39;s records; compared with the more than 1 million AI-related reports the organization received last year, the 2024 total was 67,000 reports while 2023 only saw 4,700 reports.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to issues such as abusive content being used to train models, AI chatbots have also been implicated in several dangerous or tragic cases involving young users. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OpenAI</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/another-lawsuit-blames-an-ai-company-of-complicity-in-a-teenagers-suicide-184529475.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Character.AI</a> have both been sued after teenagers planned their suicides with those companies&#39; platforms. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-temporarily-pulling-teens-access-from-its-ai-chatbot-characters-180626052.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Meta</a> is also being sued for alleged failures to protect teen users from sexually explicit conversations with chatbots.</p><p><strong>Update, January 30, 2026, 11:05AM ET:</strong> This story has been updated with several statements from Amazon.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-discovered-a-high-volume-of-csam-in-its-ai-training-data-but-isnt-saying-where-it-came-from-224749228.html?src=rss]]></description>

Instead of laboring over a spreadsheet, you can try one of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">our favorite budgeting apps</a> for less than usual. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a> is running a sale that gives new users 50 percent off one year of the service, bringing the final cost down to just $50. Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your current TV, now’s a decent time to do it. The weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are typically awash with TV deals to consider.<br><br>Generally, TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. Some 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are forthcoming things year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, now is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV. Here, we’ve curated the best Super Bowl TV deals we could find this year, from already affordable sets discounted even further to high-end OLEDs that are hundreds of dollars off.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-for-less-than-500">Super Bowl 2026 TV deals for less than $500</h2>
<p>You can easily find solid 1080p and 4K TV sets within this budget-friendly price range. What you’ll be more limited in is size — most TV deals under $500 we’re seeing right now are on sets up to 55 inches. There are a few 65- and 75-inch models in there, but the pickings are slim.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-oled-tv-deals">OLED TV deals</h2>
<p>This is where you want to look if you want your new TV to have the richest colors, deepest blacks and excellent contrast performance. Of course, that all comes at steeper prices — it can be difficult to find a good OLED set for less than $1,000, even on sale.</p>

<p>The P9 boasts transfer speeds of up to 800MB/s, making moving games to the card that much faster. As for load times, in our testing we found that any microSD Express, the standard the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/">Switch 2</a> requires, will offer roughly the same performance. This format is pretty new, so there aren&#39;t a ton of cards on the market.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have the best chance to save on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that&#39;s worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That&#39;s $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="b28a2c9fc4054925875eb91d0c7e1cbe" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.disneyplus.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

If you don&#39;t qualify for Free File, chances are you&#39;ll need to dish out cash for Intuit&#39;s software.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has yet to announce a foldable iPhone, but after years of speculation, the outlines of what’s often referred to as the iPhone Fold are starting to come into focus. Multiple analysts and leakers now agree that Apple is targeting a late-2026 launch window for its first foldable phone, positioning it as a premium flagship rather than a niche experiment.</p><p>As with all pre-launch Apple products, nothing here is official. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.</p><p>Below is a roundup of the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.</p><h2 id="jump-link-when-could-the-iphone-fold-launch">When could the iPhone Fold launch?</h2><p>Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://theorg.com/org/bloomberg/org-chart/mark-gurman" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Mark Gurman</a> has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027</a>. Analyst <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.</p><p>Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-will-the-iphone-fold-look-like">What will the iPhone Fold look like?</h2><p>Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.</p><p>When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3030017/a-case-maker-might-have-leaked-the-iphone-fold-design.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds</a> suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"> iPhone Air as a potential preview</a> of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.</p><p>If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702" style="height:1263px;width:2400px;" alt="iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air" data-uuid="406170d8-437b-3f5c-b177-d7dc898c943e"/><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel</a>, which several sources — including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Bloomberg</a> — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.</p><p>According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.</p><p>If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.</p><h2 id="jump-link-cameras-and-biometrics">Cameras and biometrics</h2><p>Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:</p><ul><li><p>Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)</p></li><li><p>One punch-hole camera on the outer display</p></li><li><p>One under-display camera on the inner screen</p></li></ul><p>Several sources claim <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Apple will avoid Face ID</a> entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">rely on Touch ID</a> built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony A7 series camera launches are eagerly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-teases-the-a7-v-its-next-flagship-midrange-camera-224000370.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">anticipated</a> by camera lovers, as those models are typically a showcase for the company’s latest imaging tech. The new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sonys-much-anticipated-a7-v-is-here-with-a-faster-33mp-sensor-and-4k-120p-video-140403371.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">A7 V</a> is a great example of that: it’s equipped with Sony&#39;s new 33-megapixel partially-stacked sensor — the most advanced in any midrange full-frame mirrorless model.</p>
<p>The A7 V’s resolution is higher than rivals like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/panasonic-s1-ii-review-a-near-perfect-creators-camera-if-money-is-no-object-174509182.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Panasonic’s S1 II</a> and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-z6-iii-is-the-first-mirrorless-camera-with-a-partially-stacked-cmos-sensor-140036768.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Nikon Z6 III</a> in this category while matching <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-eos-r6-iii-review-a-video-powerhouse-thats-also-great-for-photography-153000494.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Canon’s R6 III</a>. However, Sony trumps the latter with a faster sensor that promises lower rolling shutter distortion in electronic mode. Sony also boasts that it offers the highest dynamic range of any of its cameras to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="a588a1d8-27cf-4f62-ac74-282a903331fc" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Hybrid-Mirrorless-Camera/dp/B0G4SC4R2P/ref=sr_1_4"></core-commerce></p>
<p>Unlike Canon with the R6 III, Sony didn’t bend over backwards to accommodate creators, though. Video resolution is limited to 4K, and the A7 V lacks any RAW video capability, compared to 7K and RAW for Canon’s latest model. All of that means the A7 V may be great for some buyers, but fall short for others.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-design-and-handling">Design and handling</h2>
<p>Like other recent Sony cameras, I didn’t find the A7 V comfortable to hold for long periods of time. That’s because the grip, while deep, is a bit short and too small for large hands. At the same time, it has harder exterior materials than Canon’s cameras and is a bit heavier than the A7 IV at 1.53 pounds (698 grams) compared to 1.45 pounds (653 grams) for its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The handling makes up for the lack of comfort, though. It has two dials for the primary controls (shutter speed and aperture), along with a third for exposure compensation. There’s a dual dial with a shooting mode on top and video/photo/S&amp;Q below, plus a rear joystick, rear dial and nine buttons. The main controls fell nicely to my hands, which made camera control a cinch.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="03585922-e555-449e-b8fb-fb837823bb24"/>
<p>The A7 V has the same well-organized menu system as other recent Sony models and it&#39;s easy to customize dials, buttons and quick menus to your liking. Overall, Sony’s menus are now among the best, and functions are easier to access than on Canon’s R6 III, for example.</p>
<p>The 3.69-million dot EVF display is relatively sharp and on par with the R6 III, but falls short of 5.76-million-dot EVF on the significantly cheaper Nikon Z6 III. The 3.2-inch rear display fully articulates as before, but it also tilts now, so I was able to easily shoot from high and low angles. It’s also slightly bigger and has 2.1 million dots, up from 1.65 million dots on the A7 IV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The A7 V has a dual-slot card system with two SD UHS II slots and a faster CFexpress Type A slot. However, Type A CFexpress cards are less than half as fast as the CFexpress B cards used in other cameras. The A7 V includes a full-sized HDMI port for external display, 3.5mm mic and headphone ports, and two USB-C ports — one for charging and one for 10Gbps data transfers. Battery life is decent with up to 630 shots on a charge or 100 minutes of continuous 4K 30 fps capture. The camera isn’t constrained much by temperature limits, as I was able to shoot 4K 30p video for 90 minutes straight with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-performance">Performance</h2>
<p>The 33MP partially-stacked sensor has made a big difference in the A7 V’s speed and autofocus accuracy. It can now hit 30 fps blackout-free RAW burst speeds with the electronic shutter (with autofocus and auto exposure enabled), compared to an anemic 10 fps with the A7 IV. That makes it a surprisingly good choice for sports and wildlife photography, or just shooting fast-moving kids or pets. Speeds drop to 10 fps in mechanical shutter mode, which is on par for this category.</p>

<p>Rolling shutter distortion is only an issue when shooting super fast subjects like airplane propellers or golf swings. And unlike Canon’s R6 III and other rivals, the A7 V maintains full 14-bit RAW quality during electronic shutter bursts instead of dropping to 12-bit RAW, which allows for higher dynamic range.</p>
<p>As you’d expect with Sony, autofocus is fast and extremely accurate, delivering the best in-focus hit rate of any camera in this price range. When tracking moving subjects like bikes, birds or kids, I rarely saw a blurry shot. This applied even in tricky lighting and chaotic situations with multiple subjects. The A7 V also nailed auto exposure and auto white balance, even when I shot at dusk with a mix of indoor and outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>Sony’s latest AI features make it easy to track nearly anything. Face, eye and body tracking are supported for people, and you can also follow animals, birds, insects, cars, trains and airplanes. The AI has been trained to track people in any position, even if they’re partially obscured or disappear in the frame. This proved to be convenient when I shot street photos in crowds with a specific subject in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does bring up one sore point with the A7 V. When using third-party lenses, the burst rate speeds drop from 30 fps to 15 fps. In addition, you may not be able to use some lenses at all in AF-C (continuous) mode without applying a firmware update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In-body stabilization is improved significantly over the A7 IV from 5.5 to 7.5 stops with compatible lenses, but falls short of all rivals that hit at least eight stops. Still, I was comfortably able to shoot at shutter speeds as low as a half second handheld without any camera blur.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-image-quality">Image quality</h2><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4c147de6-490e-4b0a-bb06-c2adddc12214"/>
<p>Photo quality is where the A7 V shines. Dynamic range is superior to rival cameras, both in the real world and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.photonstophotos.net/Charts/PDR.htm#Canon%20EOS%20R6%20Mark%20III,Panasonic%20Lumix%20DC-S1M2,Sony%20ILCE-7M5" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">specialized testing</a>. This is due to Sony’s latest dual gain output tech that combines two ISO levels at once integrated with the new 33MP partially-stacked sensor (when using the mechanical shutter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed this when taking photos at twilight in several of Paris’ squares. After shooting a statue against a bright sky, I was able to extract noise-free shadow detail from RAW files and easily adjust bright areas. When shooting ducks in water that reflected a bright sky, I saw similarly high levels of detail in both dark and bright picture areas. There is one thing to keep in mind, though: As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.photonstophotos.net/Charts/PDR.htm#Sony%20ILCE-7M5,Sony%20ILCE-7M5(ES)" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><em>Photons to Photos</em></a> noted, there’s a slight drop in dynamic range below ISO 1,000 when using the electronic shutter.</p>
<p>Should you need even more detail and dynamic range, Sony’s new Composite RAW feature that’s borrowed from the A9 III combines four, eight, 16, or 32 RAW images to reduce noise and improve image quality. I used it to photograph some high-contrast scenes on a sunny Paris day and it dramatically reduced noise, but isn’t a good option for moving subjects.</p>

<p>JPEGs look great straight out of the camera with excellent detail, though noise reduction can be a bit excessive at high ISOs. Sony’s color science has improved over the last model, so colors are accurate and the magenta-hue issues seem to be largely resolved. However,I still find Canon’s cameras capture more accurate skin tones.</p>
<p>The A7 V is a low-light marvel, with relatively noise-free photos all the way up to ISO 12,800 and usable shots at ISO 25,600. What’s remarkable is that the A7 V beats all its 24MP rivals in this regard, despite the nearly 50 percent higher resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony added a new “Compressed RAW HQ” mode with the A7 V, designed to deliver better compressed RAW quality while keeping files smaller than “Lossless RAW.” Note that this new mode is not currently supported by Adobe Lightroom, so I’d avoid using it for now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two or three years ago, the A7 V would have been fine for video but not in 2026. While all its rivals are embracing internal RAW video at 6K or 7K, Sony is sticking with 10-bit 4K MP4 at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120 with an APS-C crop. The video is oversampled from a 7K sensor size so it’s very sharp though, and S-Log3 is available to boost dynamic range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony likely thinks that creators using this camera will mostly shoot 4K MP4 (as I do), so it didn’t feel that RAW was a must. However, users who do need the benefits of RAW — like minimal degradation when editing, flexible white balance and improved dynamic range — can’t even do <em>external</em> RAW capture. The 4K max resolution and lack of open gate 3:2 is also a downside for creators who like to reframe shots in post or output to social media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that all said, you <em>can</em> capture high-quality 10-bit 4K 60 fps video with the A7 V. The S-Log3 Cine/S-Log 3 option and high data rate 4:2:2 HS video provide flexibility in post, letting you easily correct over- or under-exposed video or tweak colors. As with photos, color accuracy is nearly on par with Panasonic and other rivals. Shooting in low-light is a breeze, especially when you know that noise levels will be minimal even at high ISO speeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sony has some extra video tricks like focus breathing compensation that eliminates zooming when focusing from a near to a far subject. And the A7 V comes with a new AI Auto Framing mode, which recognizes and crops in on humans, keeping them centered in the frame. I was able to keep subjects centered (while stabilizing the shot) as long as I didn’t move the camera excessively.</p>
<p>Autofocus is just as excellent for video as photos, with the same level of speed and accuracy. AI-powered autofocus supports all the same modes (people, animals, etc.) and usually nails focus of human or animal eyes, like when I captured footage of some ducks and dogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video stabilization is also very good, just behind Panasonic’s S1 II and ahead of the Canon R6 III. In regular optical-only mode, it removes shaking from handheld video without too much movement. When you engage the “Active” mode, it adds electronic stabilization with a small crop for panning or tilting, and “Dynamic Active” lets you walk with surprisingly smooth results. Rolling shutter is rarely an issue for most types of shooting, including walking, unless you really whip the camera around. The lack of rolling shutter skew also makes it easier to apply stabilization in post with Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve.</p>

<p>The A7 V is an incredible camera for photography, with speeds, autofocus accuracy and image quality ahead of rivals, including the Canon R6 III, Panasonic S1 II and Nikon Z6 III.However, Sony isn’t keeping up with those models for video. The A7 V is missing RAW, native resolution and open gate capture, all of which can be found on the aforementioned cameras. That makes it hard to recommend for serious video users or creators who use full-frame open gate to export high-quality vertical video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s one intangible, though. I enjoyed taking pictures with the A7 V more than other cameras I’ve tested lately because of the AF accuracy and image results. For anyone who wants a fast, reliable and easy-to-use camera for photography, I can’t recommend it enough. For video creators, though, I’d look at Canon’s R6 III, the Panasonic S1 II, or if you’re on a budget, Nikon’s Z6 III.</p>

ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent have also reportedly received permission from Beijing to buy a total of 400,000 H200 GPUs. <em>Reuters</em> says Chinese authorities are still finalizing the conditions they’re imposing on the companies to be able to proceed with their orders, so it may take a while before they’re able to receive their shipments. In addition, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang told reporters that his company has yet to receive orders from the aforementioned firms and that he believed China is still finalizing their licenses. </p><p>In December 2025, the US government <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-can-now-sell-its-high-end-ai-chips-to-approved-customers-in-china-trump-says-130007458.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">allowed</a> NVIDIA to sell its second-best H200 processors to vetted Chinese companies in addition to its H20 model in exchange for a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-administration-imposes-a-25-percent-tariff-on-high-end-chips-140000138.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">25 percent tariff</a> on those sales.

While Chinese companies are striving to rely on local manufacturers, such as Huawei and Baidu, for AI chips, NVIDIA’s technology is still more advanced. The H200 is only second to NVIDIA’s B200 and is around six times more powerful than the H20. </p><p>China’s National Development and Reform Commission is the agency in charge of determining the conditions Chinese companies have to meet in order to buy H200 units.

It’s less of a major shift for the company than it sounds: The newer Model 3 and Y now make up the bulk of the company’s sales. Tesla delivered over 1.5 million Model 3 and Y vehicles but sold under 450,000 Model S and X units. Musk added that Tesla’s long-term goal is to manufacture 1 million Optimus robots in the current Model S and X production space.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-killing-off-its-model-s-and-x-cars-to-make-robots-010621101.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Continue reading.</a></p><h2 id="jump-link-snap-makes-its-ar-glasses-into-a-separate-business"><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/snap-is-spinning-off-its-ar-glasses-into-a-separate-business-140000659.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Snap makes its AR glasses into a separate business</a></h2><p>It’ll still be under the umbrella of Snap.</p><p>Snap’s augmented reality glasses business will now be its own company called Specs Inc. It’ll still be fully owned by Snap, though. The company has been trying to figure out ways to raise outside money for its AR glasses to better compete with Meta, which has a lot more money to spend on development. Earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg said his Reality Labs will (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">eventually</a>) stop losing so much money as it doubles down on AI glasses and shifts away from virtual reality. According to the Meta boss, the company’s smart glasses sales “more than tripled” in 2025.</p><p>How can Snap’s Specs match the might of Meta? Well, its next pair will apparently be lighter, smaller and more capable than its older smartglass model, which was pretty dev-focused.&nbsp;&nbsp; One request: make them not look awful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/snap-is-spinning-off-its-ar-glasses-into-a-separate-business-140000659.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Continue reading.</a></p><h2 id="jump-link-the-best-tv-deals-ahead-of-super-bowl-2026"><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-the-best-sales-ahead-of-kickoff-160000725.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">The best TV deals ahead of Super Bowl 2026</a></h2><p>Maybe it’s time for an upgrade.</p><p>Hosting a Super Bowl party? Maybe you’ve been thinking about replacing an aging set, or you’re itching for a full refresh of your home theater setup — either way, if you’re looking for a good deal on a new TV, we’ve got you covered. TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. The 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are expected to arrive this year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, this is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV — it’s like the manufacturers <em>know</em> there’s a Super Bowl.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-the-best-sales-ahead-of-kickoff-160000725.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">Continue reading.</a></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-the-nex-playground-channels-the-spirit-of-xboxs-kinect-121500965.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-portable-battery-pack">What to look for in a portable battery pack</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-type"><strong>Battery type</strong></h3> 
<p>Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries">increased</a> in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cei.washington.edu/education/science-of-solar/battery-technology/">suffer</a> from a memory effect (where a battery&#39;s lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-flying-with-portable-batteries"><strong>Flying with portable batteries</strong></h3> 
<p>You may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Independent;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1149d18a-366d-41e7-9cfa-7ce4d0fd6835&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Independent&amp;linkText=just+such+a+thing+happened&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy1hbmQtYWR2aWNlL2hvbmcta29uZy1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1iYW5rLWIyNzE5MTY0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExNDlkMThhLTM2NmQtNDFlNy05Y2ZhLTdjZTRkMGZkNjgzNSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL25ld3MtYW5kLWFkdmljZS9ob25nLWtvbmctYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWZpcmUtcG93ZXItYmFuay1iMjcxOTE2NC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeU3AdLXhHs4rETBPmT2Fa8cfZB6yJ3Rqk5g0VxDNdcc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fnews-and-advice%2Fhong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/hong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html">just such a thing happened</a> in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-100-watt-hours-or-less-device">TSA</a> still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.</p> 
<p>Recently, Southwest Airlines was the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk">first in the industry</a> to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-capacity"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> 
<p>Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html">separate guide</a> that covers that entire category.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.</p> 
<p>You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wireless"><strong>Wireless</strong></h3> 
<p>Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhKVuT8-H1g">less efficient</a> than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank.</p> 
<p>Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/qi2/">Qi2</a> wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved.</p> 
<p>To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points.

<h3 id="jump-link-ports"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> 
<p>USB-C ports can deliver faster charges than USB-A ports, and most of the portable chargers we recommend here have Type-C connections. But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind).</p> 
<p>There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them).</p> 
<p>As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds.</p> 
<p>Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along.</p> 
<p><strong>Design</strong></p> 
<p>Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-best-power-banks">How we test best power banks</h2> 
<p>First, I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquired the most promising candidates and tested them in my home office.</p>

But it’s also a Bluetooth shutter with a quarter-inch tripod thread. The design resembles a standard digital camera and provides a sturdy grip once you magnetically attach your phone (make sure you’re either using a MagSafe case or no case to ensure a solid connection).</p> 
<p>The shutter is conveniently placed and the remote speed was quick enough to capture the cute things my cat was doing. The accessory can even act as a stand while it charges in either landscape or portrait orientation. As a power bank, it’s slow, taking about two hours to get my iPhone 16 from three to 98 percent, but it has enough juice for a full refill plus a little more, which could help if you’re out taking pictures all day.</p>

I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-power-bank-faqs">Power bank FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-portable-power-bank-and-a-portable-charger"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger?</strong></h3> 
<p>A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.</p> 
<p>Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-fast-charging-actually-ruin-your-battery"><strong>Does fast charging actually ruin your battery?</strong></h3> 
<p>Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.</p> 
<p>While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/vehiclebatteries/FastChargeEffects.pdf">study on EV batteries</a> (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.</p> 
<p>In short, fast charging could be <em>slightly</em> harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re optimizing charging capabilities, limit your phone&#39;s heat exposure overall.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-use-a-power-bank-for-all-your-devices"><strong>Can you use a power bank for all your devices?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html">laptop batteries</a> with AC ports.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-budgeting-apps-we-tested">Other budgeting apps we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-budgeting-apps">How we test budgeting apps</h2> 
<p>Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-budgeting-app-faqs">Budgeting app FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-plaid-and-how-does-it-work">What is Plaid and how does it work?</h3> 
<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-did-mint-shut-down">Why did Mint shut down?</h3> 
<p>When parent company Intuit <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intuit-is-closing-down-mint-its-popular-free-budget-tracking-app-054145229.html">announced</a> in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint&#39;s millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. &quot;Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,&quot; Mint wrote on its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/mint-app-news/intuit-credit-karma-welcomes-minters/">product blog</a>. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn&#39;t an exact replacement for Mint — so if you&#39;re still looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a>, you have some decent options.</p>

The quarter ending December 27, 2025 marked &quot;the best-ever quarter&quot; for iPhones, which generated a record high revenue of nearly $85.27 billion for the business. Apple doesn&#39;t disclose the number of devices sold any more, but even with the prices for many of its latest generation of smartphones surpassing $1,000 a pop, that&#39;s still got to be a heck of a lot of iPhones.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The demand for iPhone was simply staggering,&quot; CEO Tim Cook said on the conference call to discuss the results. &quot;This is the strongest iPhone lineup we&#39;ve ever had and by far the most popular.&quot;</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only massive number in the earnings report. Services revenue also logged its biggest quarter yet, growing 14 percent over the same period last year to reach just over $30 billion. It was also Apple&#39;s biggest quarter to date for total revenue, which was nearly $143.76 billion for the already fabulously wealthy company.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-reported-its-best-ever-quarter-for-iphone-sales-234135513.html?src=rss]]></description>

On Thursday, <em>Reuters</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-spacex-merger-talks-with-xai-ahead-planned-ipo-source-says-2026-01-29/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reported</a> that SpaceX and xAI are holding merger talks ahead of a planned IPO. Part of their plan is to launch AI data centers into space (but unfortunately, only as far as Earth&#39;s orbit).</p><p>Last week, it was reported that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/elon-musk-is-reportedly-trying-to-take-spacex-public-170337053.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Musk planned to take SpaceX public</a> despite having once said it wouldn’t happen until the company had a presence on Mars. Now, the IPO could happen as early as this year. Shares of xAI would reportedly be exchanged for shares in SpaceX under the merger. <em>Reuters</em> reports that two entities were set up in Nevada on January 21 to facilitate the deal. </p><p>If the idea of two Musk companies becoming one sounds familiar, that&#39;s because it happened less than a year ago. In March 2025, xAI bought X, putting Grok (known for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">nonconsensual &quot;nudifying&quot; images</a>) and X (infamous for being <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-gave-x-users-its-opinion-on-white-genocide-in-south-africa-whether-they-liked-it-or-not-151803191.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a far-right hellscape</a>) together <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">under one unholy roof</a>.</p><p>The latest idea Musk is pitching is blasting AI data centers off into space. At last week&#39;s gathering of the rich and powerful in Davos, Switzerland, he said, &quot;The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space. And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.&quot; The idea is that data centers in orbit could harness solar power and reduce cooling costs. However, industry analysts and executives consider it a risky bet, questioning whether the savings would warrant the massive investment. If or when the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI bubble bursts</a>, the plan could go down in flames — if not literally, then figuratively.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musks-spacex-and-xai-are-reportedly-holding-merger-talks-211740150.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Internet Archive has often been a valuable resource for journalists, from it&#39;s finding records of deleted tweets or providing academic texts for background research. However, the advent of AI has created a new tension between the parties. A few major publications have begun blocking the nonprofit digital library&#39;s access to their content based on concerns that AI companies&#39; bots are using the Internet Archive&#39;s collections to indirectly scrape their articles.</p><p>&quot;A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,&quot; Robert Hahn, head of business affairs and licensing for <em>The Guardian</em>, told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/01/news-publishers-limit-internet-archive-access-due-to-ai-scraping-concerns/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Nieman Lab</em></a>. &quot;The Internet Archive’s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.&quot;</p><p><em>The New York Times</em> took a similar step. &quot;We are blocking the Internet Archive&#39;s bot from accessing the <em>Times</em> because the Wayback Machine provides unfettered access to <em>Times</em> content — including by AI companies — without authorization,&quot; a representative from the newspaper confirmed to Nieman Lab. Subscription-focused publication the <em>Financial Times</em> and social forum Reddit have also made moves to selectively block how the Internet Archive catalogs their material. </p><p>Many publishers have attempted to sue AI businesses for how they access content used to train large language models. To name a few just from the realm of journalism:</p><ul><li><p><em>The New York Times</em> sued <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-york-times-is-suing-openai-and-microsoft-for-copyright-infringement-181212615.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">OpenAI and Microsoft</a></p></li><li><p>The Center for Investigative Reporting sued <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-nations-oldest-nonprofit-newsroom-is-suing-openai-and-microsoft-174748454.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">OpenAI and Microsoft</a></p></li><li><p><em>The Wall Street Journal </em>and <em>New York Post</em> sued <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/wall-street-journal-and-new-york-post-are-suing-perplexity-ai-for-copyright-infringement-050135219.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Perplexity</a></p></li><li><p>A group of publishers including <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The Guardian</em> and <em>Politico</em> sued <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/major-publishers-sue-ai-startup-cohere-over-copyright-infringement-165352238.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Cohere</a></p></li><li><p>Penske Media sued <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-faces-its-first-ai-overviews-lawsuit-from-a-major-us-publisher-162333462.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Google</a></p></li><li><p><em>The New York Times</em> and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> sued <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-new-york-times-and-chicago-tribune-sue-perplexity-over-alleged-copyright-infringement-153656431.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Perplexity</a></p></li></ul><p>Other media outlets have sought financial deals before offering up their libraries as training material, although those arrangements seem to provide compensation to the publishing companies rather than the writers.

Why, call in the robotaxis, of course. On Thursday, Alphabet&#39;s Waymo began <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/waymo-rides-at-sfo" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">offering</a> fully autonomous rides at San Francisco International Airport (SFO).</p><p>There are some limits. For now, SFO access is restricted to &quot;a select number of riders.&quot; However, access will gradually expand over the coming months. The service is also limited to the SFO Rental Car Center (pickups and drop-offs) at launch. Waymo says it will expand to other airport locations, including terminals, &quot;in the future.&quot;</p><p><em>The San Francisco Standard</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://sfstandard.com/2026/01/29/waymo-begins-operating-sfo-just-time-super-bowl/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">notes</a> that SFO is now the third airport in Waymo&#39;s repertoire. The San Francisco launch follows the company&#39;s service at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-driverless-cars-will-start-driving-on-freeways-in-three-us-cities-171654775.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Phoenix Sky Harbor and San Jose Mineta</a>. As for the Bay Area, Waymo now serves more than 260 square miles in the region.</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t Waymo&#39;s only appearance in the news this week. On Wednesday, the company said <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-waymo-robotaxi-struck-a-child-near-a-school-152446302.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">one of its robotaxis struck a child</a>, who sustained minor injuries. The incident took place on January 23 in Santa Monica. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-begins-service-at-san-francisco-international-airport-192913050.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has acquired Israel-based startup Q.ai, a move that could provide a much-needed boost to the tech giant&#39;s capabilities in artificial intelligence. Although Apple has not disclosed terms of the deal, sources told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Financial Times</em></a> that the arrangement is reportedly valued at nearly $2 billion. If that figure is accurate, the Q.ai acquisition marks Apple&#39;s second largest acquisition to date, followed by its purchase of Beats for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-28-apple-to-acquire-beats-electronics-and-beats-music-for-3-billio.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">$3 billion</a> back in 2014.</p><p>Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, said in a statement that Q.ai &quot;is a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.&quot; Apple hasn&#39;t shared any specifics about how it plans to leverage the startup, but its past work indicates the possibility of Apple moving deeper into AI-powered wearables. &quot;Patents filed by Q.ai show its technology being used in headphones or glasses, using &#39;facial skin micro movements&#39; to communicate without talking,&quot; the <em>Times</em> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>The startup&#39;s founding team, including CEO Aviad Maizels, will join Apple as part of the deal. This acquisition marks Maizels&#39; second sale to Apple; he previously founded a three-dimensional hearing business called PrimeSense that Apple bought back in 2013.</p><p>For several months, many tech insiders have speculated that an acquisition might be Apple&#39;s best path forward to catching up in the AI race. In the company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-open-to-acquisitions-to-boost-its-ai-roadmap-221925560.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Q3 earnings call</a> in July 2025, CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that &quot;We’re open to M&amp;A that accelerates our roadmap.&quot; A deal like this one could eventually lead to Apple developing its own fully in-house AI chatbot rather than relying on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a competitor like Google</a> to power artificial intelligence in its Siri assistant.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-acquires-qai-for-a-reported-2-billion-190017949.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A group of music publishers led by Concord Music Group and Universal Music Group <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gkplqybmavb/ANTHROPIC%20MUSIC%20COPYRIGHT%20LAWSUIT%20piracy.pdf"><ins>are suing</ins></a> Anthropic, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/anthropic-faces-new-music-publisher-lawsuit-over-alleged-piracy-2026-01-28/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. The suit accuses the AI company of illegally downloading more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, lyrics and compositions.</p>
<p>These songs were then allegedly fed into the chatbot Claude for training purposes. There are some iconic tunes named by Universal in the suit, including tracks by The Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond and Elton John, among many others. Concord is an independent publisher that handles artists like Common, Killer Mike and Korn.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The publishers issued a statement saying that the damages could amount to more than $3 billion. This would make it one of the largest non-class action copyright cases in US history.</p>
<p>&quot;While Anthropic misleadingly claims to be an AI &#39;safety and research&#39; company, its record of illegal torrenting of copyrighted works makes clear that its multibillion-dollar business empire has in fact been built on piracy,&quot; the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The suit was filed by the same legal team as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-will-pay-a-record-breaking-15-billion-to-settle-copyright-lawsuit-with-authors-192800292.html"><ins>last year&#39;s Bartz v. Anthropic case</ins></a>. The music publishers say they found that Anthropic had been illegally downloading thousands of songs during the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"><ins>discovery process of that suit</ins></a>.</p>
<div id="4616e9701c2d48308e64680cddd03411"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVpIt0Q35uc?si=l9W9sJxfKj87_9ks" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Bartz v. Anthropic case ended with an award of $1.5 billion to impacted writers after it was found that the company had illegally downloaded their published works for similar training purposes. The terms of that agreement dictated that the 500,000 authors involved in the case would get $3,000 per work. The $1.5 billion looks like a big number, but not so much when broken down like that. Also, Anthropic <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/anthropic-plans-raise-10-billion-350-billion-valuation-wsj-reports-2026-01-07"><ins>is worth around $350 billion</ins></a>.</p>
<p>In the Bartz case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it was legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content but not legal to acquire that content via piracy. We&#39;ll have to wait and see how this new suit shakes out. The legal precedent here seems to suggest that if Anthropic would have just spent a buck on each copyrighted song, then they&#39;d be in the clear. That&#39;s an odd distinction when it comes to building an entire company around snatching up copyrighted content, but whatever.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3-billion-over-flagrant-piracy-185459358.html?src=rss]]></description>

The incident took place in Santa Monica, California, on January 23. The company reported it to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">opened an investigation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The agency said the incident occurred close to a school within regular drop-off hours, with other children and a crossing guard nearby. The child ran from behind a double-parked SUV into the path of a Waymo Driver. Waymo said its vehicle detected the child immediately as they emerged and that the robotaxi braked hard to lower its speed from around 17 mph to under 6 mph at the time of impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Waymo said the child stood up immediately and moved to the sidewalk. The company contacted emergency services and the vehicle remained stationary at the side of the road until law enforcement allowed it to leave.</p><p>The NHTSA&#39;s Office of Defects Investigation will examine whether the Waymo Driver used appropriate caution given that it was close to a school during drop-off hours and children were close by. The probe is expected to look at the intended behavior of the vehicle&#39;s automated driving systems around schools (particularly during regular pick-up and drop-off times) and Waymo&#39;s response to the incident.</p><p>On the day that the incident took place, the National Transportation Safety Board <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/ntsb-will-investigate-why-waymos-robotaxis-are-illegally-passing-school-buses-160943613.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">opened an investigation</a> into Waymo over its vehicles improperly passing school buses in Austin, Texas.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honda and DriveOhio have teamed up on a new road safety <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/honda-corporate/releases/release-362088f67796c0d72b8469227602bc7d-honda-and-driveohio-complete-pilot-of-nations-first-proactive-roadway-maintenance-system-aimed-at-creating-safer-roads">initiative</a> in which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html">Honda</a> vehicles are being used to collect real-time data that can advise about potential issues and road deficiencies before they become a problem. Honda’s Proactive Roadway Maintenance System, which has been in prototyping since 2021, uses &quot;advanced vision and LiDAR sensors&quot; to identify issues such as worn or obstructed road signs, damaged guardrails, rough roads and emerging potholes.</p>
<p>During the pilot, members of the Ohio Department of Transportation’s smart mobility hub drove the test vehicles on around 3,000 miles of road in central and southeastern Ohio. They covered a mix of urban and rural environments, in varying weather conditions and at different times of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ODOT operators were able to review any flagged road or infrastructure deficiencies in real time using smart dashboards developed by Honda and tech firm Parsons. The University of Cincinnati helped Honda fit the sensors to its vehicles, led the development of the damage detection feature and assisted ODOT during the pilot.</p>
<p>The data collected by the vehicles was processed by Edge AI models and then passed on to Honda’s own cloud platform. The system then automatically generated work orders for ODOT’s maintenance teams in order of priority.</p>
<p>While a relatively small pilot in scope, the Proactive Roadway Maintenance System performed well in the trial across a number of metrics, delivering as high as 99 percent accuracy at highlighting damaged or obstructed signs. Accuracy was 93 percent for damaged guardrails and a slightly lower 89 percent for spotting potholes.</p>
<p>Honda says its technology could also detect high-severity shoulder drop-offs that were easy to miss in a routine visual inspection, while the system also proved reliable at measuring road roughness. The team that worked on the project estimated that if implemented on a larger scale, the automated system could save ODOT over $4.5 million a year.</p>
<p>Honda and its partners are now looking at ways to scale up the prototype Proactive Roadway Maintenance System for real-world use. The manufacturer also says it aims to eventually have similar technology in the vehicles of its customers, who will be able to share their own detection data anonymously and help create safer roads.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/honda-vehicles-used-to-proactively-report-road-safety-issues-in-nation-first-pilot-151629967.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has agreed to a preliminary $135 million settlement in a class action lawsuit brought by Android users who accused it of harvesting their data without consent. The suit alleged that since November 12, 2017, Google has been illegally collecting cellular data from phones purchased through carriers, even when apps were closed or location features were disabled.</p>
<p>As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-pay-135-million-settle-android-data-transfer-lawsuit-2026-01-28/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the affected users believed Google using their data for marketing and product development meant it was guilty of &quot;conversion.&quot; In US law, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conversion"><ins>conversion</ins></a> occurs when one party takes the property of another with &quot;the intent to deprive them of it&quot; or &quot;exert property rights over it.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Subject to approval from a judge, a settlement of $135 million was filed in a San Jose federal court earlier this week. The payout would be one of, if not the largest ever in a case of this nature, according to Glen Summers, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Each user involved in the lawsuit would be entitled to up to $100 from Google, which denies any wrongdoing and has agreed to seek consent during the setup process of a new phone from now on. A toggle will be added to enable users to easily disable data transfer, while the Alphabet-owned company will also adjust its terms of service accordingly. A trial is scheduled for August 5.</p>
<p>This is the second settlement this week for Google. On January 26, the company also <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-agrees-to-68-million-settlement-in-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-222405727.html"><ins>agreed</ins></a> to a $68 million settlement regarding claims that Google Assistant had been spying on users after being triggered by what it had misheard as wake words. Again, Google denied any wrongdoing in the class action suit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-pay-135-million-to-settle-illegal-data-collection-lawsuit-133012112.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s the year 2026 and the hottest game in my living room is <em>Fruit Ninja</em>. No, I&#39;m not in the midst of an ill-advised retro mobile gaming kick. Instead, my family and I have been jumping around and slicing flying fruit in our living room using the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nexplayground.com/?r=0" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Nex Playground</a>. It&#39;s a tiny gaming system built entirely around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-04-kinect-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Kinect</a>-like games. With its camera and onboard computer vision processing, the $249 Nex Playground can track up to four players as effectively as Microsoft&#39;s clunky old Xbox motion tracker. Simply put, the dream of the Kinect, as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-11-16-nintendo-wii-review-roundup.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Nintendo&#39;s Wii</a>, lives on in the Nex Playground.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, I was skeptical about Nex making a dent in the console arena. It&#39;s tough for new companies with no hardware experience to steal any limelight away from entrenched competitors like Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. But the Nex Playground&#39;s simplicity, accurate motion tracking and library of kid-friendly titles (including the likes of <em>Peppa Pig</em> and <em>Bluey</em>) has made it a hit among families. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260105396416/en/Nex-Playground-Showcases-Future-of-Active-Play-at-CES-and-an-Early-First-Look-at-its-2026-Product-Roadmap" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">company says it sold&nbsp;650,000 units</a> last year, which might not sound like much, but it was enough to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4rn3xk2w" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">beat the beleagured Xbox last November</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m just happy it gets my kids off the couch. I do my best to limit screen time with them, but as someone who has fond memories planted in front of my TV playing endless hours of SNES games, I also leave some room for my kids to explore tech and media on their own. I love the way <em>Minecraft&#39;s</em> near-limitless creative potential has unleashed my daughter&#39;s imagination, but I also want her to move more, especially in these winter months when we can&#39;t easily go outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the Nex Playground is another screen-based activity, the sheer variety of games to play keeps my kids entertained <em>and</em> it helps them break a sweat. The console’s version of <em>Fruit Ninja</em> is similar to that game&#39;s VR forays, where you have to stand up and make an effort to swipe your arms. You&#39;re not just dragging your fingers across a screen. <em>Go Keeper</em> gamifies the role of a soccer goalkeeper, which leads to my kids jumping all over our family room to block and catch stray balls. And we all love having mini-dance parties with <em>Starri</em>, which has you swinging your arms and dodging obstacles, similar to VR titles like <em>Beat Saber</em> and <em>Synth Riders</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to those three games, the Nex Playground comes with <em>Party Fowl</em>, a collection of mini games, as well as its own spin on <em>Whack-a-mole. </em>If you want more games, you have to subscribe to the Nex Play Pass for $89 a year or $49 for three months. The company also offers a $29 Sports Pack at Target stores, which includes tennis, basketball and bowling games. Beyond those options, though, there&#39;s no other way to add new titles to the Playground. You can&#39;t buy anything individually, and since the entire platform is digital, there&#39;s also no market for cheap used games like you&#39;d find for consoles.</p>
<p>Nex&#39;s subscription model is undoubtedly the Playground&#39;s biggest flaw, especially given the system’s $249 price. Instead of being an expensive console that you buy once (like an Xbox), and then occasionally purchase new titles for, the Playground is an ongoing commitment constantly calling for your wallet. To the company&#39;s credit, the device doesn&#39;t feature any ads or in-app purchases.</p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately, we would like to establish that long-term relationship ... we want to serve your family consistently with new content, and new updates all year round,&quot; Nex CEO David Lee said in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-why-is-the-nex-playground-ai-console-such-a-hit-181151201.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">an interview on the Engadget Podcast</a>. He noted that the company added twenty new games to its subscription over the last two years, as well as 40 game updates over the last year. Similar to Xbox&#39;s Game Pass, the goal is to maintain the Nex Play Pass&#39;s value over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could argue the Nex Play Pass&#39;s steep price isn&#39;t as bad as the $15 to $30 per child that indoor activity centers charge. Those godforsaken places only distract kids for a few hours at a time, and visiting one also comes with the risk of contracting exotic childhood illnesses. Theoretically, the Nex Playground could be something you turn to whenever you need to work out restless energy from your kids. And if that means parents could get a bit more sleep on the weekend, or just a few minutes to themselves for a cup of coffee, all of a sudden $89 a year doesn&#39;t seem so bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also impressed by the Nex Playground&#39;s hardware and software, both of which are far more polished than I&#39;d expect from a new hardware company. The device itself is a pastel-colored plastic box with a camera on the front (and a cute lens cover). You just have to plug it into power and an HDMI port, slap some batteries in the remote (which looks like an elongated Roku remote) and connect to Wi-Fi. It took a few minutes for the Playground to update the first time I turned it on, and I also had to create a Nex account using my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that initial setup phase was over, it took another five minutes to download the initial batch of five games to the Playground via my gigabit connection. That timing entirely depends on your internet setup — I&#39;ve seen reports of it taking up to 30 minutes to install the Nex&#39;s core games. I was also able to download the entire Play Pass library of titles in 35 minutes, but it could take a few hours on slower connections. Thankfully, those downloads happen in the background, so you can play other titles while waiting for new ones to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another plus? Once you&#39;ve downloaded the games, you can play them entirely offline. That makes it easier to grab the Playground and bring it on vacation, or to a friend&#39;s house, than it is to travel with other consoles. As long as you can reach a TV&#39;s inputs, have nearby power and clear out around six feet of space, you can play the Playground.</p>

<p>Nex&#39;s long experience developing motion-tracked games and experiences is a major reason why the Playground is so successful. The company previously created <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.homecourt.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Homecourt</a>, an app for tracking your basketball skills, as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.activearcade.ai/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Active Arcade</a>, a collection of Playground-like minigames for iOS devices. Lee admitted that it’s tough to get parents to use their phones for things like Active Arcade. That led him to develop the Playground as a closed ecosystem, where the company could build a suite of games around a device where it could control every aspect of the hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that Nex Playground features games from well-known kids brands like <em>Peppa Pig</em>, it’s clear that Lee’s intuition has paid off. While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences. You don’t need to set up a clunky console or any additional accessories. Just plug in the Nex Playground, and you too could be hand-slicing virtual fruit on your TV in no time.</p>

You can pick them up for $199 right now, which is $50 off and the best discount we&#39;ve seen since the earbuds came out at the end of last year.</p> 
<p>We gave these AirPods a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">review</a> and we consider them the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds for iPhone</a> users. The third generation model is a substantial update to an already impressive product, bringing new features like live translation to the table.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="9d2a9c264099463ba10d3ed1a8a4d49b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 also offer heart-rate tracking, allowing them to stream live data to Apple Fitness and other third-party workout apps. This lets you track your fitness and close activity rings similarly to when using an Apple Watch.</p> 
<p>Apple also improved the sound quality of this generation thanks in large part to a redesigned acoustic architecture that improves how air is delivered into the ear canal. Additionally, the company changed the angle of the drivers to help more sound get where it needs to go instead of bouncing off the sides of your ear. We felt the jump in audio quality from the last generation to this one was substantial.</p> 
<p>The ANC on the AirPods Pro 3 has also been improved. Apple claims this model filters out twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. We found the noise cancellation to be top-notch.</p> 
<p>Live Translation is as neat as it sounds, leveraging the AirPods&#39; noise cancellation tech, Apple&#39;s AI and beam-forming mics to help you understand a speaker in a different language. Right now, this is limited to a handful of languages with more being added over time.</p> 
<p>It&#39;s not often you see one of Apple&#39;s best and most recent products on sale for 20 percent off, so if you&#39;re in the market for an upgrade or your first set of AirPods, consider taking advantage of this deal. If you&#39;re looking to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale right now, too, for $119.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brandon Sanderson, a popular author of high-fantasy and science fiction books, has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">signed a deal</a> with Apple TV to adapt his works set in the Cosmere fictional universe into films and TV shows. Sanderson <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/brandon-sanderson-mistborn-movie-celsius-232" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">said</a> last year at Celsius 232, Spain’s annual sci-fi and fantasy convention, that his ultimate dream project is a “really good <em>Mistborn</em> film.” Apple TV is making that come true: Some of the first projects to come out of the deal are feature film adaptations of the Mistborn books and a TV show based on  series. </p><p>According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, Sanderson’s deal with the streaming service is unprecedented, because he will have major creative control over the adaptations. He will write, produce and consult for the projects under development, and he will have the power to sign off on various aspects of the adaptations. That’s a level of control other famous authors such as George R. R. Martin don’t enjoy. In fact, Martin recently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/george-rr-martin-interview-thrones-winds-dragon-knight-1236473519/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">talked about</a> how <em>House of the Dragon’s</em> showrunner, Ryan Condal, has stopped taking his notes and suggestions into account. </p><p>Sanderson’s Cosmere universe encompasses dozens of books set in various but interconnected worlds and timelines. They’re all bound by a single creation myth, which explains where the universe’s different types of magic come from. Apple TV has yet to announce timelines and release dates for the projects based on Sanderson’s work, but The Stormlight Archive TV adaptation already has a producer (Blue Marble) attached to it. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-signs-tv-and-movie-deal-for-brandon-sandersons-fantasy-books-130000797.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been household technology for a while now, but there&#39;s still a lot of uncertainty around them. This is partly due to the fact that they can conceal online activity that local or national governments deem illegal — up to and including, say, circumventing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ID checks for age verification</a>. Consumers aren&#39;t helped by the sheer amount of duds sold in app stores right next to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best VPNs</a>, especially when they&#39;re <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">purposefully exploiting moments</a> that have people rushing to shore up their online anonymity. If you&#39;ve almost decided to start using a VPN, you may be wondering if the services you&#39;re looking at are actually safe.</p><p>Unfortunately, the answer is a hard &quot;it depends.&quot; VPNs are technology that can work well or poorly, just like they can be used for good or evil. There&#39;s nothing intrinsically dangerous about using a VPN — whether or not one is safe comes down to who built it and how they&#39;re running it. The good news is that there are easy ways to tell whether you’re using one of the good ones.</p><p>The question &quot;Are VPNs really safe?&quot; can also mean something else — &quot;Is using a VPN enough to keep me safe online?&quot; I&#39;ll get into that too, but to spoil the ending: VPNs are important security tools, but they aren&#39;t enough to protect against all digital threats by themselves. Also, to be clear, I&#39;m talking here about commercial VPNs like Proton VPN and ExpressVPN, not commercial VPNs like NordLayer or Cisco AnyConnect.</p><h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-vpn-unsafe"><strong>What makes a VPN unsafe?</strong></h2><p>There are two main things that can make me call a VPN unsafe: negligence and malice. A negligent VPN doesn&#39;t protect against the dangers it&#39;s supposed to ward off, leaving you more exposed than if you weren&#39;t using a VPN at all. A malicious VPN is designed to make you less safe so the people behind it can profit.</p><p>Some ways a negligent VPN might endanger its users:</p><ul><li><p>Using outdated protocols with cracked encryption, like PPTP, or homebrewed protocols with insufficient security. A weakly secured protocol might expose your search activity.</p></li><li><p>Allowing leaks by using public DNS servers rather than setting up their own system to resolve requests. This risks revealing what websites the VPN&#39;s users are visiting.</p></li><li><p>Leaking the user&#39;s real location by failing to block or properly manage IPv6.</p></li><li><p>Leaving its servers in the hands of unvetted third parties, who might let them get hacked.</p></li><li><p>Failing to include a kill switch, which puts users at risk of connecting to false servers.</p></li></ul><p>Some ways a VPN can be malicious:</p><ul><li><p>Making its money from in-app ads, especially if those ads contain trackers.</p></li><li><p>Harvesting the user&#39;s residential IP address and selling it as a proxy.</p></li><li><p>Tracking the user&#39;s activity and selling it to advertisers.</p></li><li><p>Planting malware on the user&#39;s device.</p></li></ul><p>I want to stress again that none of these risks are inherent to how a VPN works. VPNs aren&#39;t required to be dangerous in any way. There are plenty of good ones, which makes it all the more important to pick the bad ones out of the lineup. In the next section, I&#39;ll discuss how to do that.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-tell-if-a-vpn-is-safe"><strong>How to tell if a VPN is safe</strong></h2><p>The process of checking up on a VPN starts before you buy it. Before you consider downloading any VPN app, do your research and learn as much as you can. Read review sites like Engadget, but also try to get reports from regular users on social media and app stores. Be suspicious of five-star reviews that are light on specifics — the more positive reviews from actual users, the better.</p><p>While researching, look for any cases in which the VPN failed in its mission to protect customers. Did it ever turn information over to police, despite having a no-logs policy? Were any of its servers ever breached by hackers in ways that put other users in danger? Is it cagey about key information, like where it&#39;s based or who its parent company is?</p><p>You can also close-read the VPN&#39;s privacy policy, like I do in my VPN reviews. A privacy policy is a legal document that can invite lawsuits if the provider ignores it outright, so most companies prefer to plant vague loopholes instead. Read the policy and decide for yourself if it makes any unacceptable exceptions to &quot;no logs ever.&quot;</p><p>If the answer to all those questions is no, your next step is to download the VPN and test it. Every worthwhile VPN has a guaranteed refund within a certain period, so you can use that time to test the factors below. If you like the results, you can subscribe for longer; if not, you can cancel and get your money back. Here&#39;s what to look for during the refund period:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check which VPN protocols are available. </strong>The best expert-verified protocols are OpenVPN, IKEv2 and WireGuard. If the VPN uses a protocol other than these three, make sure it&#39;s using an unbreakable encryption cipher like AES-256 or ChaCha20.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test for leaks. </strong>You can run a simple leak test using a website like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a></a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://whatismyipaddress.com" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">whatismyipaddress.com</a></a>. Just check your normal IP address, connect to a VPN server, then check again. If the IP address you see is the same as before, the VPN is leaking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find the kill switch.</strong> A kill switch prevents you from accessing the internet while you&#39;re not connected to its associated VPN. This is critical to prevent certain types of hack that rely on fake servers to work. Most top VPNs have a kill switch or a similar feature with a different name (such as Windscribe&#39;s Firewall).</p></li><li><p><strong>See if the apps are open-source. </strong>A VPN making its services available for viewing on Github states powerfully that it has nothing to hide. Anonymity is an inalienable right for individuals, but VPN apps aren&#39;t people — the more transparent the code, the better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test its other security features. </strong>If the VPN has a blocker for ads, malware or trackers, see if it prevents banner ads from loading. Try connecting to a test malware site like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://www.ianfette.org" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">www.ianfette.org</a></a> or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://httpforever.com" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">httpforever.com</a></a> and check if the VPN blocks it.</p></li></ul><p>There&#39;s one more factor that generally denotes a safe VPN: paid subscriptions. I&#39;m not going to claim that all free VPNs are dangerous, but if a service claims to be always free with no need whatsoever to pay, you have to ask how it makes money. VPNs that don&#39;t charge for subscriptions usually turn their users into the product, selling their data to advertisers or for use as residential proxies.</p><h2 id="jump-link-is-a-vpn-enough-to-keep-you-safe-online"><strong>Is a VPN enough to keep you safe online?</strong></h2><p>Another way in which VPNs aren&#39;t totally safe is that they aren&#39;t, by themselves, a total solution for cybersecurity. A VPN does one specific task: it replaces your IP address with an anonymous server and encrypts communication with that server so your real device can&#39;t be seen. This means you won&#39;t reveal your identity or location in the normal course of using the internet.</p><p>However, if you reveal information another way, then all bets are off. If you click a sketchy link that downloads malware onto your computer, that malware doesn&#39;t care that your IP address is concealed — it&#39;s already where it needs to be. Similarly, if you leak critical information in a social post, or privately give it up to a phishing scammer, a VPN won&#39;t help.</p><p>I put together a list of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">12 cybersecurity habits</a> that&#39;ll keep you safe from nearly all threats online. Getting a VPN is one of them, but there are 11 others, including strengthening your passwords, immediately installing updates and conditioning yourself to spot social engineering hacks. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking you&#39;re untouchable just because you use a VPN.</p><h2 id="jump-link-the-safest-vpns"><strong>The safest VPNs</strong></h2><p>It can be a lot of work to figure out whether a VPN is safe and trustworthy.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DJI just revealed the RS 5 camera gimbal, a new entry in its long-standing Ronan Series. The RS 5 is lightweight, at around three pounds, with a maximum payload of nearly seven pounds.</p>
<p>This gimbal offers what DJI calls &quot;enhanced intelligent subject tracking.&quot; The tracking <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-mobile-8-gimbal-adds-pet-tracking-and-apple-dockkit-support-120032512.html"><ins>was already impressive</ins></a> with some of the company&#39;s older offerings, so any improvement will be icing on the cake. A new tracking module lets videographers frame live footage and follow subjects directly from an included touchscreen, all without having to fiddle with the actual camera.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/37c9f9e0-fc67-11f0-a757-5b09356c909a" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/37c9f9e0-fc67-11f0-a757-5b09356c909a" style="height:850px;width:1264px;" alt="A gimbal." data-uuid="5410bf01-e1b8-35a0-b8cb-158e108af06b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure>
<p>The tracking module also offers the ability to follow more than people. It can track pets, vehicles or just about any other object. It can also help maintain a locked focus on a human subject up to 10 meters away.</p>
<p>The RS 5 includes the company&#39;s latest stabilization algorithm, which DJI says lets videographers &quot;effortlessly achieve complicated camera movements, such as surround shots, reverse tracking or single-person fixed-camera tracking.&quot; It&#39;s also great for when the cameraperson is capturing footage while walking or running.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been designed to carry a wide range of mainstream mirrorless cameras and lens combinations and can switch to vertical shooting without additional accessories. There&#39;s a nifty little briefcase handle for capturing footage from above or below.</p>
<p>The RS 5 delivers up to 14 hours of use per charge and can be fully charged in just an hour. Video shoots can take forever, so this is a welcome bit of news. For true marathons, there&#39;s a separate enhanced battery grip accessory that extends the runtime to 30 hours.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/63fcfa80-fc67-11f0-99d6-62ecb7354700" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/63fcfa80-fc67-11f0-99d6-62ecb7354700" style="height:950px;width:1266px;" alt="Two cars and a gimbal. " data-uuid="98a46baa-39bb-3fec-8fb8-23a2b80b8f27"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure>
<p>The standard DJI RS 5 includes the gimbal, a quick-open tripod, quick-release plates, a regular battery grip and some other useful accessories. That pack costs around $680. The combo pack includes all of the above, plus the enhanced tracking module, a carrying case and an electronic briefcase handle. That costs around $859.</p>
<p>Now for the bad news. We don&#39;t have a US release date or even any information as to if it will be available here. Engadget has reached out to DJI for more information. The company&#39;s drones were <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/why-dji-drones-might-be-banned-in-the-us-170030273.html"><ins>recently banned from being imported to the US</ins></a>. This only impacts newly-released models and shouldn&#39;t impact gimbals or anything like that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-launches-the-lightweight-rs-5-camera-gimbal-for-video-creators-120056173.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Color is the buzziest feature in ereaders right now, but is it necessary? It makes the covers more fun, and readers of comics and graphic novels will appreciate the added hues (though they may be happier with an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablet</a> for better image detail). Color is just one factor to consider when picking out the best ereader. The lights, screen quality, housing and buttons make a difference too. Then there’s the software: Do you want to stay in the Kindle ecosystem or get a device that can handle lots of apps? We tested more than a dozen ereaders to come up with our recommendations. This guide also points out ways to get the most out of your new e-book companion once you pick your favorite.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader">What to look for in an ereader</h2> 
<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Color ereaders add a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> 
<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.</p> 
<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading-features"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> 
<p>With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> 
<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.</p> 
<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-other-features"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> 
<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> 
<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you&#39;ll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> 
<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p>

<p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.</p>

<p>Buying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p>

Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files.

Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.</p> 
<p>Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe&#39;s, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Send+to+Kindle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3NlbmR0b2tpbmRsZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc2VuZHRva2luZGxlIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5ZVsNxdCVtDYx5iNTxXHLeRX1mGBWg9NRQRPJNtX_j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsendtokindle" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle">Send to Kindle</a> page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.</p> 
<p>Boox also uses a browser uploader called <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://push.boox.com/#/push/file">BooxDrop</a> (along with <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZ0_NBysfk">many other methods</a>) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> 
<p>Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/bookshoporg-is-now-selling-ebooks-113033975.html">up to 100 percent of the profits</a> will go to local booksellers.

<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-read-library-books-on-an-ereader"><strong>How to read library books on an ereader</strong></h3> 
<p>Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html">Overdrive</a> and its companion app <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a>. On a <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader">Kobo</a>, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.</p> 
<p>To read library books on a <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> 
<p>For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox&#39;s Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> 
<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders">How we test ereaders</h2> 
<p>When putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p> 
<p>Over the course of the past three years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html">Amazon’s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> 
<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: &quot;A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.&quot;</p> 
<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.</p>

After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.</p> 
<p>I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There&#39;s a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be <a data-i13n="cpos:41;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">better served by an E Ink tablet</a>, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-an-ereader-and-an-e-ink-reader"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?</strong></h3> 
<p>Really, they are the same thing. <a data-i13n="cpos:42;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/about?company">E Ink</a> is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.</p> 
<p>But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink <em>tablets</em>. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to <a data-i13n="cpos:43;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">helping you pick out an E Ink tablet</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-there-ads-on-my-ereader"><strong>Are there ads on my ereader?</strong></h3> 
<p>The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereader-has-the-longest-battery-life"><strong>Which ereader has the longest battery life?</strong></h3> 
<p>Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> 
<p>Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> 
<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> 
<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle-only+books&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2I_bm9kZT0xOTI3MTcwNjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYj9ub2RlPTE5MjcxNzA2MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVfQtILpNl4j-jhmpgChMRVcssUkpbLilOSDy4FrIhd1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fnode%3D19271706011" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19271706011">Kindle-only books</a> is much larger <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Kobo;elmt:;cpos:45;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;linkText=than+Kobo%E2%80%99s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2tvYm9vcmlnaW5hbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vdXMvZW4vcC9rb2Jvb3JpZ2luYWxzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATjuNnZvRXlMJC6dkHZ86gdxoVLQ4PXMnCI_YfD7Ivq4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkobooriginals" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/kobooriginals">than Kobo’s</a>.

<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereader-is-best-for-library-books"><strong>Which ereader is best for library books?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-laptops">How we test laptops</h2> 
<p>Engadget has been <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-20/">reviewing laptops for two decades</a>, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-we-test-laptops-203909669.html">testing</a> their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft&#39;s Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP&#39;s Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-a-laptop">Factors to consider when choosing a laptop</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-system-apple-windows-or-chrome-os">Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS</h3> 
<p>There&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it&#39;s another story if you&#39;ve become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an Apple-loyalist, there aren&#39;t many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">MacBooks</a>, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we&#39;ve ever seen. They&#39;re incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you&#39;re used to iOS and iPadOS.</p> 
<p>That brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple&#39;s other platforms. You can&#39;t respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft store;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2056b88c-29ec-4b6a-8252-c765ce3c4422&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft+store&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+Phone+Link+app&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvc3luYy1hY3Jvc3MteW91ci1kZXZpY2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvd2luZG93cy9zeW5jLWFjcm9zcy15b3VyLWRldmljZXMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf6ecThFK8UkL1n9MqlvWg-rE0x3ymgn2Y8PiFuAQZb1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fsync-across-your-devices" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/sync-across-your-devices">Microsoft&#39;s Phone Link app</a> lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone&#39;s photos.</p> 
<p>If cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.</p> 
<p>As for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.</p> 
<p>And what about ChromeOS? <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebooks</a> are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they&#39;re not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren&#39;t many apps or games that work offline, and they also don&#39;t work with powerful software suites like Adobe&#39;s (you can use the stripped-down <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/02/adobe-express-photoshop-google-chromebook-plus">Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools</a>, though).</p> 
<p>Chromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they&#39;re popular in schools because they&#39;re cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.</p> 
<p>If, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-chromebook-plus-initiative-pushes-higher-spec-standards-and-handy-software-tools-130055583.html">Chromebook Plus models</a> to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">company’s online AI features</a>, like AI image generation and photo processing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you&#39;re looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you&#39;re willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). For entry-level systems, you’ll often have to decide whether you’d rather prioritize processing power or storage, especially if 512GB SSD upgrades bump the price. Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.</p> 
<p>I’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">the best budget laptops</a> that you can check out as well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-laptop-size-and-weight">Laptop size and weight</h3> 
<p>So how portable do you want your laptop to be? That&#39;s the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it&#39;s enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).</p> 
<p>If you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.</p> 
<p>For artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you&#39;d expect, you&#39;ll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.</p> 
<p>You can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming systems</a> or souped-up workstations. They&#39;re not meant for mere computing mortals.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports-and-connectivity">Ports and connectivity</h3> 
<p>These days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple&#39;s MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you&#39;ll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft&#39;s Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-spectre-x360-14-review-2024-keeping-the-2-in-1-laptop-dream-alive-140045823.html">HP&#39;s Spectre x360 14</a>, as well as many models from ASUS.</p> 
<p>For gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re a fan of wired headphones, it&#39;s worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that&#39;s a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it&#39;s still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.</p> 
<p>Most laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">routers</a> and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn&#39;t made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there <em>are</em> notebooks like the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">Surface Pro 9</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-180044021.html">Samsung Galaxy Book</a> models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life"><strong>Battery life</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop&#39;s battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.</p> 
<p>If battery life is your absolute priority, I&#39;d strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple&#39;s M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you&#39;d expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-refresh-rate"><strong>Refresh rate</strong></h3> 
<p>A laptop&#39;s refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we&#39;re seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)</p> 
<p>While high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we&#39;re seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-and-gpu">CPU and GPU</h3> 
<p>If you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs so you’re not short on processing power a year from now. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel&#39;s older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don&#39;t have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you&#39;re looking at used systems.</p> 
<p>You&#39;ll also see AMD&#39;s Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you&#39;ll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD&#39;s main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel&#39;s Arc hardware (though those are getting better).</p> 
<p>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-rebuilt-windows-11-around-ai-and-arm-chips-173152776.html">rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture</a>, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.</p> 
<p>As for Apple&#39;s laptops, you&#39;ll be choosing between the M4 Pro, M4 Max and M5, each of which is progressively more powerful.</p> 
<p>On the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop&#39;s display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD&#39;s chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 40-series hardware or AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.</p> 
<p>Apple&#39;s M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD&#39;s lower-end dedicated GPUs. That&#39;s quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it&#39;s another reason we highly recommend Apple&#39;s notebooks.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ai-pcs-npus-and-copilot"><strong>AI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+</strong></h3> 
<p>Simply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).</p> 
<p>We were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html">AMD announced</a> in 2023. Intel unveiled its <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">&quot;Core Ultra&quot; CPUs</a> in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-8040-chips-remind-intel-its-falling-behind-in-ai-pcs-200043544.html">Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips</a> that month (and it couldn&#39;t help but say they were faster than Intel&#39;s new hardware). But in May, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html">Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative</a>, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.</p> 
<p>Copilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-postpones-the-launch-of-its-controversial-recall-ai-feature-031554596.html">Recall</a>, which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-paint-is-getting-an-ai-powered-image-generator-that-responds-to-your-text-prompts-and-doodles-190653716.html">Cocreator in Paint</a>, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.</p> 
<p>If you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.</p> 
<p>At the time of this post, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-a-slew-of-ai-powered-software-features-to-chromebook-plus-laptops-130049652.html">Chromebook Plus notebooks</a> can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.</p>

<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html">ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition</a> is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.</p> 
<p>While the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14’s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. It’s mushier than we’d like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. You’ll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.</p> 
<p>Where the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-14-oled">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</h3> 
<p>Aside from its lovely OLED screen, the <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-14-oled-review-ai-pc-143054247.html">ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED</a> doesn&#39;t stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I&#39;d recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-razer-blade-14">Razer Blade 14</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-2024-review-a-portable-but-pricey-powerhouse-specs-price-160020891.html">Razer Blade</a> has almost everything you&#39;d want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it&#39;s far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it&#39;s certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-framework-laptop-16">Framework Laptop 16</h3> 
<p>Framework gave its modularity magic to the <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-16-review-modular-wonder-mediocre-gaming-laptop-150026910.html">Laptop 16</a>, delivering a gaming notebook where almost every single component is user replaceable. But you&#39;ll have to pay a pretty penny to snag it with upgraded hardware, and its optional Radeon 7700S GPU was surprisingly slow.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-alienware-m16-r2">Alienware m16 R2</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-m16-r2-review-when-less-power-makes-for-a-better-laptop-174027103.html">Alienware m16 r2</a> has been revamped with a slimmer case, but it’s otherwise a fairly typical gaming laptop. It’s a solid option for Alienware fans, but you’ll find better hardware and deals elsewhere.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-asus-zenbook-duo-2024">ASUS Zenbook Duo (2024)</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-specs-price-the-first-dual-screen-laptop-worth-buying-130016756.html">Zenbook Duo</a> is a fascinating dual-screened notebook, and according to my colleague Sam Rutherford it’s the first of its kind that’s worth buying. But its unique hardware isn’t really meant for mainstream consumers, and Windows 11 still doesn’t support multi-screen setups well enough to make full use of the Zenbook Duo’s ample canvas.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dell-xps-16">Dell XPS 16</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-16-review-beauty-and-power-comes-at-a-cost-200513721.html">Dell’s XPS 16</a> is big and beautiful, but it’s far too expensive compared to the competition. Plus, it uses a capacitive row of function keys that you basically can’t see under bright light and has too few ports for a machine of this size.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-laptop-faqs">Laptop FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-average-battery-life-of-a-laptop-per-charge">What is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?</h3> 
<p>It’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-ram-do-i-really-need">How much RAM do I really need?</h3> 
<p>The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you <em>could</em> use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start.</p> 
<p>If you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-storage-capacity-for-a-laptop">What is the best storage capacity for a laptop?</h3> 
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB <a data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ssds-140014262.html">SSDs</a> (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.</p> 
<p>If you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.</p> 
<p>We recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It&#39;s also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-a-good-price-range-for-a-decent-laptop-in-2026">What&#39;s a good price range for a decent laptop in 2026?</h3> 
<p>You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you&#39;ll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-macos-and-windows-which-is-better">What’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?</h3> 
<p>Simply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple&#39;s notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You&#39;ll also find Chromebooks running Google&#39;s ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.</p> 
<p>Debating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the &#39;80s, so we won&#39;t be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.</p> 
<p>But if you care more about playing the newest games, you&#39;ll want to have a Windows system. If you&#39;re more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you&#39;re running an iPhone).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-laptop-brands">What are the best laptop brands?</h3> 
<p>There is no single &quot;best&quot; laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we&#39;re generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option that’s the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, <a data-i13n="cpos:40;pos:1" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52019024">dominate laptop sales worldwide</a>. We&#39;d avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don&#39;t have a major presence in the US.</p>

You can still buy the vehicles as long as there are units to be sold, and Tesla promises to support them for as long as people have them. Once they’re gone, though, they’re gone for good, because Tesla is converting their production space in the company’s Fremont factory into a space for the manufacturing of Optimus humanoid robots.</p><p>Model S is Tesla’s second vehicle and has been in production since 2012, while the Model X SUV has been in production since 2015. Their shine has faded over the years, however, and the newer Model 3 and Y now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-says-it-delivered-a-record-18-million-evs-in-2023-082906995.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">make up the bulk</a> of the company’s sales. For the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">entirety of 2025,</a> for instance, Tesla delivered 1,585,279 Model 3 and Y vehicles but only sold 418,227 Model S and X units. The company also had to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-halts-model-s-and-x-sales-in-china-due-to-tariffs-185752814.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">stop selling</a> Model S and X in China in mid-2025, because they were being imported from the US and were subject to China’s tariffs that were put in place in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported goods. </p><p>In the call, Musk said that Tesla’s long-term goal is to be able to manufacture 1 million Optimus robots in the current Model S and X production space. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland a few days ago, the CEO announced that Tesla will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-just-told-davos-that-tesla-will-sell-humanoid-robots-next-year-really-he-swears-192515568.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">start selling Optimus</a> to the public by the end of next year. Musk has big plans for Optimus and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/elon-musk-says-tesla-owners-can-text-and-drive-very-soon-042454805.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">once said</a> that it’s bound to become the “biggest product of all time,” bigger than cellphones, “bigger than anything.” But the humanoid robot has been failing to live up to the hype during demonstrations, and Musk is known for his overly optimistic timelines. </p><p>The company’s earnings report has also revealed that Tesla invested $2 billion in Musk’s other company, xAI. Tesla’s shareholders notably <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/tesla-shareholders-sue-musk-for-starting-competing-ai-company/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">sued Musk in 2024</a> for starting xAI, which they argued is a direct competition to the automaker. The CEO has been claiming for years, after all, that Tesla is an AI company and not just an EV-maker. Still, Tesla’s shareholders <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation-package-233217531.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">approved Musk’s $1 trillion</a> pay package in late 2025 on the condition that the company reaches a market value of $8.5 trillion. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-killing-off-its-model-s-and-x-cars-to-make-robots-010621101.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg says there&#39;s an end in sight to Reality Labs&#39; years of multibillion-dollar losses following the company&#39;s layoffs to the metaverse division earlier this year. The CEO said he expects to &quot;gradually reduce&quot; how much money the company is losing as it doubles down on AI glasses and shifts away from virtual reality.</p><p>Speaking during Meta&#39;s fourth-quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg was clear that the changes won&#39;t happen soon, but sounded optimistic about the division that lost more than $19 billion in 2025 alone. &quot;For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.&quot;</p><p>The company cut more than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">1,000 employees</a> from Reality Labs earlier this month, shut down <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-has-closed-three-vr-studios-as-part-of-its-metaverse-cuts-202720670.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">three VR studios</a> and announced plans <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-closing-down-its-vr-meeting-rooms-as-part-of-its-wider-cull-140000422.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to retire</a> its app for VR meetings. Meta has also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">paused</a> plans for third-party Horizon OS headsets. Instead, Meta is doubling down on its smart glasses and and wearables business, which tie in more neatly to Zuckerberg&#39;s vision for creating AI &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">superintelligence</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>During the call, Zuckerberg noted that sales of Meta&#39;s smart glasses &quot;more than tripled&quot; in 2025, and hinted at bigger plans for AR glasses. &quot;They [AI glasses] are going to be able to see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you and help you as you go about your day and even show you information or generate custom UI right there in your vision,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zuckerberg has spent the last few years laying the groundwork <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-metaverse-is-getting-an-ai-makeover-194004996.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">for pivoting</a> Meta&#39;s metaverse work into AI.  He offered one example if what the means for Meta’s Horizon app.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You can imagine … people being able to easily, through a prompt, create a world or create a game, and be able to share that with people who they care about. And you see it in your feed, and you can jump right into it, and you can engage in it. And there are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that. And Horizon, I think fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that. </p><p>“But there&#39;s definitely a version of the future where, you know, any video that you see, you can, like, tap on and jump into it and, like, engage and kind of like, experience it in a more meaningful way. And I think that the investments that we&#39;ve done in both a lot of the virtual reality software and Horizon … are actually going to pair well with these AI advances to be able to bring some of those experiences to hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>One thing Zuckerberg didn’t mention, though: the word “metaverse.”</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Patreon creators will need to make some changes soon, thanks to Apple. On Wednesday, Patreon said Apple has renewed its requirement that all Patreon creators must move to subscription billing. The deadline to do so is November 1, 2026.</p><p>Patreon&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post</a> announcing the change made it clear that it had no other choice. &quot;We strongly disagree with this decision,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months.&quot;</p><p>Up to this point, Patreon’s billing model has operated in a gray area, allowing its creators to charge fans outside the App Store without paying Apple’s fees. When the issue first surfaced, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">described</a> it as stemming from how paid content was accessed (only some creators offered content that could be consumed in-app). On Wednesday, a Patreon representative described the gray area as being “because Apple’s In-App Purchase system doesn’t support some of Patreon’s longstanding billing models.”</p><p>But now Apple has reimposed its subscription mandate, eliminating the gray area. &quot;We know that Apple is serious about enforcing this mandate,&quot; Patreon wrote. &quot;Late last year, they blocked a Patreon app update and made it clear that in order to remain in the App Store, we have to comply with their billing requirement. Because millions of fans use iOS as their primary way to access Patreon and connect with creators, having our app blocked — or not available in the App Store at all — isn&#39;t an option.&quot;</p><p>Patreon’s &quot;whiplash&quot; description isn&#39;t hyperbole. Apple first announced the mandate in 2024. At that time, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="slk:deadline;cpos:3;pos:1">deadline</a> for all Patreon creators to make the switch was set to November 2025 — one that Patreon grudgingly accepted. But according to the company, Apple told it last May that the original 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. Now, it appears to have reversed that again.</p><p>If there&#39;s a silver lining, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/apple-tells-patreon-to-move-creators-to-in-app-purchase-for-subscriptions-by-november/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">notes</a> that only 4 percent of Patreon creators are using the affected (legacy) billing models. And fans can still bypass Apple&#39;s fees on iOS by joining via their iPhone&#39;s web browser. Patreon has much more detail for creators in its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">announcement post</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/536d8711-5d36-42fa-8429-bd459832b212" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/536d8711-5d36-42fa-8429-bd459832b212" style="height:3290px;width:4934px;" alt="DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 21: U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks to Apple CEO Tim Cook (L) as he attends a reception for business leaders at the&nbsp;World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting on January 21, 2026 in Davos, Switzerland.
