<p>While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025, as a few models are getting the axe this time around. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to receive the boot in 2023, and this year, iPhones released in 2018 will be left behind. If your device is ineligible, Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues, so you can at least download that.</p>

<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-when-will-ios-26-become-available"><strong>When will iOS 26 become available?</strong></h2>
<p>As of today, Monday, September 15, you can officially download and install iOS 26.&nbsp;</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>

That means less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens is too dirty.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a summer of beta updates, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">iOS 26</a> is here. As long as you have a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-arrives-on-monday-find-out-if-your-iphone-is-eligible-for-the-free-update-191854034.html">compatible iPhone</a>, you can install the new software right now. Head to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>, and get ready for a Liquid Glass makeover.</p>
<p>iOS 26 offers <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Apple&#39;s biggest visual change to its software</a> since iOS 7. (That was when Jony Ive&#39;s flat design replaced Scott Forstall&#39;s skeuomorphic one.) This time around, the software adopts a translucent material theme: Liquid Glass. Although it isn&#39;t a return to skeuomorphism, it does reincorporate a sense of depth, simulating a pleasantly refractive glass. Expect colors and visual effects that respond to their onscreen surroundings.</p>

<p>Apple has taken flak from industry pundits for not rushing headfirst into AI. (Or, at least it hasn&#39;t with the same manic frenzy as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-recap-ai-updates-android-xr-google-beam-and-everything-else-announced-at-the-annual-keynote-175900229.html">its competitors</a>.) The company is taking a more measured approach, gradually incorporating it into its software. This year&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-intelligence-announcements-at-wwdc-everything-apple-revealed-for-ios-macos-and-more-171133645.html">Apple Intelligence additions</a> include live translation in messages, FaceTime and Phone. Visual Intelligence also expands beyond the camera and into screenshots. And your Genmoji and Image Playground creations might look less… strange than last year&#39;s versions.</p>
<p>Even Apple Music gets a new AI feature. Its new automix generates transitions between songs, aiming for DJ-like progressions. I find that it works best with danceable genres like EDM or hip-hop. It usually won&#39;t bother trying to mix less beat-driven singer-songwriter-type stuff.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/816a71a0-8ffd-11f0-bec3-dcf91c4b8d91" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/816a71a0-8ffd-11f0-bec3-dcf91c4b8d91" style="height:528px;width:938px;" alt="Screenshot of live translation in iOS 26 messages." data-uuid="05eb9c82-173a-34d4-9128-a46438bc4a25"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure>
<p>Arguably handier than new AI features is Apple&#39;s revamp of its communication apps. Call screening lets you gather info from callers before deciding whether to pick up. Hold Assist saves you from having to listen to the Muzak. And the Messages app adds new screening options and filters. You can also add custom backgrounds and even conduct polls in your messaging threads. Finally, the Phone app cleans up its interface, unifying its tabs into a single list.</p>
<p>There&#39;s much more on tap, of course. For that, you can check out <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">Engadget&#39;s iOS 26 preview</a>.</p>

Apple&#39;s other software updates are here today, too. iPadOS 26 gives the tablet its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">most Mac-like productivity boost to date</a>. watchOS 26 <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">adds sleep scores and an AI coach</a>.

It truly is teensy, resembling an Apple TV streaming box more than a desktop computer. All told, it's five-inches by five-inches across and two inches tall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>There are two front-facing USB-C ports, which is extremely handy. The back of the computer boasts even more ports, including Thunderbolt, HDMI and Ethernet. As indicated by the name, this thing features the speedy M4 chip. The processor can easily handle garden variety computing tasks, like watching content, but also excels with creative pursuits like making music and editing videos.</p> 
<p>This desktop doesn't include an SD card reader, which could be a dealbreaker for those looking for an easy way to add more storage. We also found that the fan got loud every once in a while when dealing with heavy workloads. Otherwise, this is a near-perfect (and adorable) computer.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-reach-framework-deal-tiktok-trump-xi-speak-friday-2025-09-15/"><ins>has said</ins></a> that the United States and China have reached a framework deal on TikTok. Speaking to reporters in Madrid after two days of talks with his Chinese counterparts, Bessent said, “It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” President Trump said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://wordtohtml.net/These%20comments%20come%20ahead%20of%20planned%20conversations%20between%20President%20Trump%20and%20Xi%20Jinping,%20expected%20to%20be%20held%20on%20Friday."><ins>Truth Social post</ins></a> that he will be speaking with Xi Jinping this Friday regarding the potential deal, among other things.</p>
<p>This breakthrough comes after the Trump administration extended the TikTok ban for a third time earlier this summer, giving the company until September 17 to undergo a sale or face a ban in the United States. The short-form video content app faced increasing scrutiny over national security concerns due to the Chinese ownership of its parent company, ByteDance.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>President Trump issued an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-tiktok-us-microsoft-190552645.html"><ins>executive order</ins></a> in August 2020 banning the app in the United States unless it was divested from ByteDance, though <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/07/944039053/u-s-judge-halts-trumps-tiktok-ban-the-2nd-court-to-fully-block-the-action"><ins>courts halted</ins></a> enforcement of the order. In 2024 the United States Congress passed the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521"><ins>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA)</ins></a> which was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html"><ins>signed into law</ins></a> by then-President Biden. The Trump administration has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of that law in hopes a deal could be made for a US-based acquisition, leaving the app online in the meantime.</p>
<p>As it stands, this appears to be a framework for how TikTok could come under some level of US control, and not a signed final deal. Companies from <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-denies-talks-with-oracle-about-a-tiktok-deal-but-says-a-decision-will-likely-be-made-within-30-days-163755199.html"><ins>Oracle</ins></a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/what-will-happen-to-tiktok-a-look-at-the-potential-buyers-000110723.html"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, and the president is <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-tiktok-us-microsoft-190552645.html"><ins>on record</ins></a> as saying he would be OK if a &quot;very American company&quot; buys it. It&#39;s unclear if the September 17 deadline will be pushed once again, but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that another delay may be needed in order to get the deal signed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tiktok-deal-may-finally-be-happening-160448732.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-wireless-earbuds">What to look for in the best wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">AirPods</a> or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.</p> 
<p>For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.</p> 
<p>When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.</p> 
<p>Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.</p> 
<p>We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-labels-say-apple-musics-spatial-audio-royalties-only-benefit-the-biggest-player-211730447.html">Spatial Audio</a>, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-wireless-earbuds">How we test wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).</p> 
<p>To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-we-tested">Other wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wf-c710n">Sony WF-C710N</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-c710n-review-more-than-midrange-180018400.html">WF-C710N</a> is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-powerbeats-pro-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</h3> 
<p>The newest version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-buds-3">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-and-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review-airpods-clones-that-actually-deliver-171024116.html">Galaxy Buds 3</a> combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sennheiser-momentum-sport">Sennheiser Momentum Sport</h3> 
<p>I really like the overall shape of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review-fitness-earbuds-that-lack-finesse-130036233.html">Momentum Sport</a> earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-solo-buds">Beats Solo Buds</h3> 
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-solo-buds-review-exactly-what-youd-expect-for-80-170742296.html">Solo Buds</a> for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-ultra-open-earbuds">Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</h3> 
<p>Bose created something very unique for <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">this set of earbuds</a> that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-audio-technica-ath-twx7">Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-twx7-review-good-earbuds-with-frustrating-flaws-160054450.html">These stick buds</a> have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mw09">Master &amp; Dynamic MW09</h3> 
<p>Retooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master--dynamic-mw09-review-premium-materials-impeccable-clarity-132522028.html">MW09</a> has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-earbud-faqs">Wireless earbud FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-considered-good-battery-life-for-true-wireless-earbuds">What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Most wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-sound-quality-better-on-headphones-or-earbuds">Is sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is also outstanding.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-wireless-earbuds-have-the-longest-battery-life">Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?</h3> 
<p>With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-audio-technica-ath-cks5tw-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW</a>. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08</a> offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-are-waterproof">What wireless earbuds are waterproof?</h3> 
<p>There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-earbuds-stay-in-ears-the-best">Which earbuds stay in ears the best?</h3> 
<p>A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-work-with-ps5">What wireless earbuds work with PS5?</h3> 
<p>PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-inzone-gaming-monitors-headsets-specs-pricing-availability-210056794.html">Sony’s own gaming headsets</a> come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has a press event scheduled for September 30 at 10AM ET. Panos Panay, who leads the company&#39;s Devices &amp; Services team, will be on hand. This strongly suggests that Amazon will announce some new hardware.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t exactly know what the company will reveal, but we do have a giant clue. The press invite also included a composite image of various Amazon devices. These appear to include a Kindle ereader, a Fire TV of some kind and an Echo speaker. Those are three of the company&#39;s biggest product categories.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve gotten a new entry-level Kindle, though Amazon did recently refresh both the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html"><ins>Scribe</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html"><ins>Colorsoft</ins></a>. It&#39;s also possible the company will announce a refresh of the Paperwhite ereader.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a similar story with Echo speakers. The company recently refreshed the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html"><ins>Echo Dot</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-unveils-the-40-echo-pop-a-semi-spherical-smart-speaker-140026706.html"><ins>Echo Pop</ins></a>, along with the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/echo-show-8-3rd-gen-hands-on-174000825.html"><ins>Echo Show 8</ins></a>, but it&#39;s been nearly five years since it redesigned the standard Echo speaker. It&#39;s possible the company&#39;s speakers will be getting some kind of new integration with the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html"><ins>Alexa+ smart assistant</ins></a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a couple of years since we&#39;ve gotten a big influx of new Fire TVs and related streaming sticks, so those could also be on the docket. However, that part of the invite image is a bit fuzzy and might be advertising an upcoming tablet and not new TVs. In any event, we only have a couple of weeks before finding out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-may-be-announcing-new-echo-and-kindle-devices-on-september-30-152044048.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, rising prices for streaming services feels as inevitable as death and taxes. So when a serious discount is available, we tend to sit up and take notice. For a few weeks, you can get a whopping half off an annual subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount Plus;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=855ca62e-ee52-453f-91a1-14fbe4f4bd6a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;linkText=Paramount%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1NWNhNjJlLWVlNTItNDUzZi05MWExLTE0ZmJlNGY0YmQ2YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFyYW1vdW50cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOKUU1vXUXbEUW7l4rCKNUFLhf9Zv8VyJSYD7ySdLSg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.paramountplus.com/">Paramount+</a>. A year of the Paramount+ Essential plan, which is ad-supported, will cost $30 compared to the usual $60. Paramount+ Premium, which is ad-free except for live tv programming, will cost $60 for a year instead of $120.</p> 
<p> <core-commerce id="3bdb2f3abd5e487ea7660b9423be2e46" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.paramountplus.com"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer. Anyone who signs up for a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">Paramount+</a> from now through September 18 will be able to get this pricing. The only real caveat with this deal is that you have to pay for the full year in advance; month-to-month subscriptions will still cost the usual rate.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Paramount+ has some great programming options, particularly if you're a fan of anything involving RuPaul. It's also the home of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-third-season-falls-short-of-its-second-020030139.html"><em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-lower-decks-ends-on-a-new-beginning-140003832.html"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, which are arguably the best modern additions to the sci-fi show's canon, as well as the other past and present <em>Star Trek</em> series. The platform offers a solid lineup of sports as well. And if you opt to go for the Premium plan, you'll also be granted access to Showtime titles such as <em>Yellowjackets</em> and the rebooted <em>Dexter: Resurrection</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html">Awe Dropping event</a> started with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKphYoxGeRE">dramatic health testimonials</a> from Apple Watch users, then revealed a key new feature for the new Watch Series 11: hypertension alerts. The function had yet to receive FDA clearance at the time, but that has now been granted, as first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/apple-watch-hypertension-detection-coming-next-week-after-fda-nod"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and confirmed by Apple. As a result, it will reportedly be available to users in 150 countries when the Watch 11 and Ultra Watch 3 ship starting on September 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypertension alerts can help detect hypertension (high blood pressure), a potentially dangerous condition that affects over a billion people. The feature relies on the Watch&#39;s optical heart sensor, but now uses new machine learning algorithm that also draws from a study involving more than 100,000 participants to look for high blood pressure. It works in the background a month-long period to seek patterns associated with hypertension. Unlike devices that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shop.yhetechs.com/products/bp-doctor-fit">measure your specific blood pressure</a>, it only tells users that there may be a danger.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Last year, Apple received FDA clearance for its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apples-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-will-work-on-airpods-pro-154814439.html">over-the-counter Hearing Aid function</a> that transforms the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">second-gen AirPods Pro</a> into OTC hearing aids for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Another recently approved feature is <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-brings-sleep-apnea-detection-to-the-watch-series-10-172316987.html">sleep apnea detection</a>. However, the company is currently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html">facing a lawsuit</a> over the Apple Watch&#39;s redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Correction, September 15, 2025, 10:27AM ET:</strong> This article and its headline originally stated that the Apple Watch received FDA approval for the new hypertension alerts feature. It received FDA clearance, which is a lower level of authorization compared to FDA approval. We apologize for this error.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-clearance-for-hypertension-alerts-120046138.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Anker says the 622 Magnetic Battery can recharge a dead iPhone 16 or 16 Pro to just over 80 percent, and an iPhone 16 Pro Max to just over 60 percent. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-622-magsafe-battery-pack-irl-143059141.html">hands-on review</a> of the portable charger, we liked the magnetic stand that folds out into a 30-degree angle. Users can rotate their phone to either portrait mode or landscape mode while charging.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The Anker 622 is an older charger, so it outputs a maximum of 7.5W when charging wirelessly. If you need to refill your battery faster than that, you might want to pick up one of the newer Qi2 power banks. Though a Qi2 power bank will, of course, cost more, some of our favorites are having great sales right now.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There must be something in the water at Spotify HQ. Less than a week after <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-lossless-streaming-is-finally-here-and-its-included-with-a-premium-plan-131009528.html">delivering long-promised lossless audio</a>, the company has another treat. Free listeners can finally listen to any track they want. After enhancing Premium, perhaps Spotify figured it could add a free perk without shedding subscribers.</p>
<p>Spotify accounts on the free plan can now choose any track and immediately listen to it. Previously, that was paywalled for Premium subscribers. Non-paying ones had to shuffle through an album or playlist until the song they wanted to hear came up. And the free tier&#39;s limited skips meant you might have to wait a while to get to it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now you can choose any track you want by searching, selecting it in an album or playlist or tapping a shared one. The feature rolls out globally beginning today. However, the free plan&#39;s other limits haven&#39;t changed, so you&#39;ll need to listen to ads and choose your limited skips wisely.</p>
<p>Pre-existing features of Spotify&#39;s free tier include personalized recommendations, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/spotify-debuts-an-in-app-cover-art-maker-for-playlists-130026423.html">AI playlist covers</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-latest-playlist-auto-adapts-to-your-day-122541712.html">&quot;daylists.&quot;</a> If you can live without hi-fi audio, offline playback or ad-free listening, the view from the cheap seats is better than ever.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/free-spotify-users-can-finally-listen-to-any-track-immediately-130013081.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap is upgrading the software that powers its augmented reality glasses as it gets ready for the first <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html"><ins>non-developer version</ins></a> of its &quot;Specs&quot; next year. The latest update to Snap OS  includes an improved web browser, as well as the ability to browse Spotlight videos in AR.</p>
<p>The company has long said that one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/launch-specs-2026"><ins>its goals</ins></a> for AR glasses is to enable people to spend less time staring at their phones. Snap hasn&#39;t quite accomplished that yet,  but Snap OS is starting to get more features that could help the company get there.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has redesigned the browser in Snap OS to make it easier to switch between sites and resize windows to different aspect ratios. It&#39;s also faster and more power efficient, with the ability to watch around 40 minutes of continuous video playback. (The current version of Spectacles tops out at around 45 minutes of battery life.) Speaking of video, Spectacles is also getting a dedicated lens for browsing Spotlight, Snapchat&#39;s short-form video platform. There&#39;s also a new gallery lens that allows you to preview photos you&#39;ve snapped with the glasses&#39; onboard camera and quickly scroll through them with hand gestures.</p>
<p>The update arrives one year after the company first showed off its somewhat goofy-looking AR glasses. Since then, hundreds of developers have been experimenting with the device and creating their own AR lenses for the platform. But those experiences have so far had a very limited reach as the company has only made its AR Spectacles available to developers willing t<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snaps-fifth-generation-spectacles-bring-your-hands-into-into-augmented-reality-180026541.html"><ins>o pay a pricey subscription</ins></a>. That&#39;s set to change sometime in 2026, though, when Snap says it will start selling a smaller, lighter and more capable pair of glasses.</p>
<p>The company has yet to divulge details about the redesigned form factor or what powers &quot;Specs&quot; will have. But the new version of Snap OS shows the company is trying to make its AR platform more useful.</p>

It was designed to work the company's <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-hands-on-the-unibody-and-camera-plateau-feel-more-significant-in-person-185553855.html">new iPhone 17 models</a> with faster charging speeds than previous iPhones.</p> 
<p>Lugging heavy chargers is a particularly bugbear of mine so the Dynamic Power Adapter stands out with a footprint not much bigger than the smallest 40W chargers. With AVS, it can provide a specific power level that's ideal for what a given device needs at specific times in its charge cycle. To that end, it can hit up 60W but only for a limited time period of around 18 minutes, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1nfhctl/hands_on_review_apples_4060w_dynamic_power_adapter/">according to one tester</a>.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>"With Dynamic Power, you get many of the same benefits of higher-wattage chargers in a compact, pocket-size form factor," the Apple explains in the product description. "For faster charging, pair [it] with iPhone 17 models (50 percent battery in around 20 minutes) or iPhone Air (50 percent battery in around 30 minutes)."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With its fold down prongs it'll easily slide into a pocket and not weigh you down like regular 60W chargers. For instance, Anker's popular Nano II 65W GaN charger is one of the smaller options available but is still about twice the size of Apple's new model. However, due to the limited time at higher wattages, it won't be suitable for charging laptops like some third-party models. The other rub is the price: The 40W Dynamic Power Adapter <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e217e970-c2a6-42e1-bb24-32ff440063b2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=costs+%2440&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HS040QU0vQS80MHctZHluYW1pYy1wb3dlci1hZGFwdGVyLXdpdGgtNjB3LW1heCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTIxN2U5NzAtYzJhNi00MmUxLWJiMjQtMzJmZjQ0MDA2M2IyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HS040QU0vQS80MHctZHluYW1pYy1wb3dlci1hZGFwdGVyLXdpdGgtNjB3LW1heCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfB7tYPdQrF78N9rPhH0UYQiJ7N1QxcsKYz798b-wFh-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMGKN4AM%2FA%2F40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKN4AM/A/40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max">costs $40</a>, almost twice as much as Anker's 65W charger.</p>

And with a notable improvement in battery life, the company now provides enough power for you to use these AirPods for an entire work day. Importantly, Apple managed to do all this without raising the price.</p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 also carry many of the same features that made the AirPods Pro 2 such a compelling option for iPhone users. Those include the robust <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-take-apples-hearing-test-with-the-airpods-pro-2-173014978.html">hearing health tools</a>, hands-free access to Siri, gesture-based notification interactions, audio sharing with another set of AirPods, simplified setup and more.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Since I’ve gone over all of these at length before, and because there’s a long list of updates on the AirPods Pro 3, I’ve chosen to focus primarily on the new tools in this review. But you shouldn’t overlook the exhaustive set of features that the AirPods Pro have amassed over the years, especially when you consider how Apple continues to find new ways to deploy its H2 chip.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-changes-on-the-airpods-pro-3">Design changes on the AirPods Pro 3</h2> 
<p>With a cursory glance, you likely won’t notice the design changes on the AirPods Pro 3. The company altered the shape of these smaller earbuds to align with the geometry of the ear canal for a more comfortable and secure fit. Of course, you’ll also notice the newly installed heart-rate sensor upon closer inspection, covering a previously blank surface of the AirPods Pro 2. Once you remove the new foam-infused ear tips from the latest model though, you’ll see the most obvious variation between the second- and third-generation versions.</p> 
<p>On the AirPods Pro 2, the grille protecting the driver sat flush with the surface of the main housing. Now, it’s extended out from the rest of the earbud, with a nozzle-like component similar to what much of the competition uses. Apple also revised the angle of the drivers, so sound beams more directly into your ears rather than bouncing as much off of the sides. As such, a side-by-side comparison of the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods Pro 2 will show you that the ear tips are pointing in slightly different directions.</p> 
<p>There are also some visual differences on the AirPods Pro 3’s charging case. Like it did for the AirPods 4 last year, Apple has removed the Bluetooth pairing button entirely. You’ll now double tap on the front of the case near the LED to activate that function while the AirPods Pro are in their case. Additionally, just like AirPods 4, the LED is now hidden, so you don’t see the dot when it’s not illuminated. It’s a small thing, but as I noticed on last year’s models, it makes the surface of the case look cleaner.</p>

<p>Thanks to the AirPods Pro 3’s revised curves and foam-filled ear tips, Apple is calling this model the “best-fitting AirPods ever.” While I do think that’s true, I also believe that the new fit will take some getting used to — especially if you’ve worn the AirPods Pro 2 before.</p> 
<p>First, the new tips feel very different and seal off your ear canal in a more complete way than the Pro 2’s silicone-only tips. If you’ve used foam ear tips before, you know they provide better passive noise isolation than their silicone counterparts, and that remains true here. In fact, you may need to go down a size to find the most comfortable fit with the AirPods Pro 3. For example, I typically wear medium ear tips, but those felt too tight here. After swapping them out for the small ones, I began to understand why Apple won’t stop bragging about the updated fit.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-upgraded-anc-and-its-impact-on-other-features">Upgraded ANC and its impact on other features</h2> 
<p>Across the first two generations of the AirPods Pro, Apple had already made big strides in active noise cancellation. But with the AirPods Pro 3, the company ramped up its efforts several notches. Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise. The new foam-infused ear tips play a major role here too, since they offer increased passive noise isolation. This trio of improvements allowed Apple to cover more of the noise spectrum, including higher frequencies like human voices.</p> 
<p>In the last week, there have been several times when I had the AirPods Pro 3 in and I couldn’t hear someone talking right next to me. In fact, Apple says the latest model cancels twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times more than the original AirPods Pro. Obviously, I don’t have a way to quantify that, but I can tell you the ANC performance on this new model was noticeably stronger than before.</p> 
<p>The improved seal the AirPods Pro 3’s ear tips offer helps make Apple’s ANC setup more precise. This allows the active noise cancellation system to be the foundation for several of the company’s other features like the Hearing Test, Live Translation and more. For the Hearing Test, you can now be in slightly louder environments without Siri asking you to relocate to a quieter place. And with Live Translation, ANC will lower the voice of the person you’re speaking to so you can focus on Siri playing the role of interpreter.</p>

<p>At WWDC, Apple announced that Live Translation would be coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">in iOS 26</a>. There was no mention then that it would come to AirPods. Skip ahead to the iPhone 17 event and Live Translation was easily one of the most exciting new features announced for the AirPods Pro 3, because it will allow the wearer to translate in-person conversations with Apple’s earbuds.</p> 
<p>Google has been offering real-time translation on Pixel Buds <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-25-google-pixel-buds-review.html">for years</a>, so Apple is very late to the game here. However, the AirPods Pro 3 uses its H2 chip in different ways, and now combines Voice Isolation, ANC and the beamforming mics to enable Live Translation. What’s more, you can activate it on the earbuds themselves (press and hold on both stems), ask Siri to start it or set the iPhone’s Action Button to carry out the task.</p> 
<p>When Live Translation begins, ANC kicks in to muffle environmental noise and to reduce the volume of the person you’re speaking to. Both are done so you can clearly hear Siri’s translation through your AirPods. Siri will warn you when ambient sound levels are too high, asking you to move to a quieter spot so that it can hear the speaker better.</p> 
<p>Live Translation worked well, at least for my Spanish-to-English and French-to-English tests. Plus, a real-time transcription is visible in the Translate app so you can show it to the person you’re chatting with — an element that’ll be useful for international travel. Just know that if you’re looking at your phone too, you’ll see the translation there before the audio comes through your AirPods. This isn’t surprising since the processing is being done by the connected iPhone, but seeing the English version right before I heard it was slightly confusing.</p> 
<p>You will need to enable Apple Intelligence on a compatible iPhone for Live Translation to work. The tool leverages Apple’s AI to translate the meanings of phrases so that sentences have the proper context. The feature will also be available on any AirPods that have the H2 chip inside, which includes the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC. You’ll have to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/translate-text-voice-and-conversations-iphd74cb450f/ios#:~:text=Download%20languages%20for%20offline%20translation%20or%20On-Device%20Mode">download the different language models</a> before you get started, too. Apple explains that the downloads would be required for offline use, but Siri prompted me to do so to use Live Translation even when I was was connected. Lastly, only five languages are supported at launch: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. Apple says Italian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese (simplified) are coming later this year.</p>

<p>After initially debuting heart-rate sensing capabilities on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">the Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, Apple is now bringing it to the AirPods Pro 3. Like with the Powerbeats model, heart rate data from the AirPods can be accessed by Apple’s own Fitness app in addition to other workout apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder and Peloton. Basically, if an app works with the Powerbeats Pro 2, it should work with the AirPods Pro 3, and it should do so by the time those earbuds ship. As always, I expect even more integrations will be announced in the future, so don’t panic if your go-to app has worked with Apple gear in the past but doesn’t yet support the AirPods Pro 3.</p> 
<p>I exclusively tested the new heart-rate sensing tech on the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s Fitness app. I’m an Apple Watch owner and that’s where the bulk of my stats already reside. Speaking of the Watch, you don’t have to worry about conflicting streams of heart rate info if you’re using it as well as the AirPods Pro 3 during a workout. Apple explained that its devices will work together to provide multiple streams of data for better coverage of your activity. What’s more, if you don’t wear your Apple Watch during a session, the Fitness app will use data gathered from the AirPods Pro 3 to still log your stats for your Move, Exercise and Stand rings.</p> 
<p>During this review, I used the AirPods Pro 3 to monitor my heart rate primarily during outdoor walks. The earbuds actually support 50 different workouts in the Fitness app though, with HIIT, yoga and paddling among the available options. You can even track a session at the archery range.</p> 
<p>You’ll see live heart rate metrics on the workout screen alongside stats like time and distance, and your average heart rate will be displayed in the workout summary when you’re done. Heart rate info is also displayed with Live Activities on the lock screen and is a tap away on the icon in the Dynamic Island. So far, I haven’t encountered any issues leaving my Watch at home and relying solely on the AirPods Pro 3. The earbuds provided a constant stream of data to the Fitness app.</p>

<p>The improvement to sound quality on the AirPods Pro 3 isn’t exclusively due to its new drivers/transducers. Although those components were revised this generation, Apple’s biggest strides in the audio department are also thanks to increased air flow inside the earbuds. The company developed a new multiport acoustic architecture for better control of the air that delivers sounds into the ear. This allowed Apple to significantly improve bass response while providing a wider soundstage and increased vocal clarity.</p> 
<p>With all of that air to move around, Apple had to tweak its drivers for the task, but also make sure its tuning covered all the needed frequencies adequately. But those transducers remain the same size as the AirPods Pro 2. As I mentioned, Apple also reconfigured their angle so they now beam sound more directly into the ear canal. You might recall that an angular adjustment was also part of the company’s strategy for improving audio quality on the AirPods 4.</p> 
<p>The improvement you hear first will depend on the style of music you choose. Pick something with big, bombastic drums like Deftones’ “my mind is a mountain” and you’ll immediately notice the warmer, boomier bass. Opt for a track like Hayley Williams’ “True Believer” and your initial impression will likely be the enhanced vocal quality. And if you go for a song like Sleep Token’s “Dangerous” that’s more atmospheric, you’ll get a great sense of the expanded soundstage.</p> 
<p>Oftentimes audio companies make claims about sound quality improvements that don’t translate to what I actually hear. With the AirPods Pro 3, all of Apple’s proclamations not only hold true but are obvious, observable improvements.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-call-quality-and-voice-performance">Call quality and voice performance</h2> 
<p>Apple’s best-in-class transparency mode has been one of my favorite things about AirPods for years. No other company manages to handle ambient sound in a way that’s so clear it’s almost as if you aren’t wearing earbuds at all. With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple says it took things even further, making your voice and the voices of those around you sound “more natural and vibrant.” The company points specifically to Hearing Aid and Live Translation as areas where this fine-tuned transparency mode will help, but it will also be a boost to voice and video calls, too.</p> 
<p>Since Apple does such a good job of feeding your voice back through the AirPods Pro 3 and other transparency-enabled AirPods models, you never feel the need to talk louder to hear yourself on calls. It lets you relax and speak normally, and makes a day’s worth of Zoom calls much less exhausting.</p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 support Apple’s newly introduced <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">studio-quality voice recording</a> as well. Arriving with iOS 26, the feature allows you to capture higher-quality vocal clips in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages, FaceTime and any CallKit-enabled software. And when you’re recording video with an iPhone, you can now quickly select AirPods as the main audio source. The earbuds can act as a lavalier microphone with voice pickup that’s closer to your mouth.</p>

<p>Even with all of the new features, Apple still managed to extend the AirPods Pro’s battery life. With ANC enabled, you can now expect up to eight hours of use on a charge — two hours longer than the AirPods Pro 2. This means you could be able to wear the new model for a full day of work without having to charge them. Additionally, Apple says that if you’re using transparency mode with the Hearing Aid feature, AirPods Pro 3 will last up to 10 hours.</p> 
<p>So far, I have no reason to think Apple has overstated battery life on the AirPods Pro 3. I haven’t conducted a straight battery rundown test yet as I’ve been focused on trying all of the new features at various times over the last few days. I will update this review later this week with the results of my battery test though.</p> 
<p>If you find the promised eight hours still isn’t enough, a five-minute rest in the case will be enough to give you an hour of use. That’s long enough to get you through a quick workout or a call when you need to keep things hands-free. There is an important caveat with the case though. Despite the extended use time on the earbuds themselves, the total battery life including the case is reduced to 24 hours from the previous 30. There’s also a new ultra wideband chip (U2) in the charging case that Apple says has increased the distance for Precision Find My by one and a half times compared to the previous version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-competition">The competition</h2> 
<p>Since <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">the “regular” AirPods</a> now offer ANC, Apple’s primary competition for the AirPods Pro 3 comes from within its own product lineup. The AirPods 4 with ANC offer an open-type fit even though they have impressive noise-blocking abilities, so they may be more comfortable for those who don’t like buds sticking into their ear canals. You’ll get Live Translation there too, but you won’t be able to access heart-rate tracking and Apple’s suite of hearing health tools. That might not matter to those who want to save some money though, as the AirPods 4 with ANC are $179 versus $249 for the AirPods Pro 3.</p> 
<p>All AirPods are really a conduit for Apple’s ecosystem, so if you don’t mind missing some iPhone integrations and special features, there are worthwhile alternatives. <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM5</a> remains a jack of all trades, offering a set of features that perhaps only Apple can rival.

The sum of the company’s upgrades here are more significant than the choice to finally bring ANC to the “regular” AirPods last year. The combination of more precise ANC, improved sound quality, heart-rate tracking, Live Translation and longer battery life is a lot to explore. And that’s not even counting the redesign and new ear tips that offer a more secure fit, two items that directly address one of the main criticisms of previous AirPods models.</p> 
<p>If recent history is any indication, the company will continue to add new features to this third-generation version. I highly doubt that Apple is finished exploiting the power of the H2 chip, so it's just getting started with what the AirPods Pro 3 can do.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c87b81dd-4c28-44d2-b00a-481abbeda6a2" />

"I've never won anything in my life," Rogen said during his <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOmqt_GCL3w/">off-the-cuff acceptance speech</a>. "When I was a kid I bought a used bowling trophy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple+ also garnered two acting awards for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/severance-season-two-review-even-before-the-finale-innie-rights-and-humanity-made-for-a-stronger-show-100003889.html"><em>Severance</em></a>, including Britt Lower (Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series) and Tramell Tillman (Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series). However, HBO Max's medical drama <em>The Pitt</em> surprisingly pipped <em>Severance</em> for the Best Outstanding Drama Series, while also earning Noah Wyle and Katherine LaNasa drama series awards for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actress, respectively. HBO Max also scooped awards for its comedy series <em>Hacks</em> with Jean Smart taking the Outstanding Lead Actress trophy and Hannah Einbinder winning for Outstanding Supporting Actress.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix took the prize for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series with critical darling <em>Adolescence</em>, with that same show earning Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty Emmys for lead actor and supporting actor and actress, respectively (at 15, Cooper is the youngest-ever male winner of a Primetime acting Emmy). That show also won Emmys for outstanding directing and writing for a limited or anthology series or movie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Emmys showed again how prestige and money continue to shift from networks to streamers. CBS's only Emmy was for <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, a show it canceled in August. NBC won for the <em>Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special</em>, while cabler HBO took prizes for <em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em> (Outstanding Scripted Variety Series and Outstanding Writing) along with <em>The Penguin</em> (Cristin Milioti for Outstanding Lead Actress) and <em>Somebody Somewhere</em> (Jeff Hiller for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series).&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-won-big-at-the-primetime-emmys-with-severance-and-the-studio-093051329.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p></p> 
<p>No pun intended, but what I like about <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Quicken;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Quicken&amp;linkText=Quicken+Simplifi&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAay1xJNTnjYldw5nF1qz8tSfhiJSkTuaz3OiZWyrTB-K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fquicken.com%2Flp%2Fppc%2Fsimplifi-vs-mint%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://quicken.com/lp/ppc/simplifi-vs-mint/">Quicken Simplifi</a> is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Another one of the key features I appreciate is the ability to set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch).</p> 
<p>Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there's a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.</p>

<p>In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase.</p> 
<p>The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average.</p> 
<p>Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.”</p>

My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it's more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it.</p> 
<p>Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You'll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.</p>

<p>Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=introduced&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9yZXBvcnRzLWNhbmFkYS1pbXByb3ZlZC1zeW5jaW5nIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3JlcG9ydHMtY2FuYWRhLWltcHJvdmVkLXN5bmNpbmcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeK62o1SLpdRxDJdlcN8USUe_xrXlKuyGd4uvsYmoaYy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Freports-canada-improved-syncing" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/reports-canada-improved-syncing">introduced</a> a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph.</p> 
<p>The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+expanded+on+the+net+worth+graph&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9uZXctbmV0LXdvcnRoLWNoYXJ0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWFuZC1tb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L25ldy1uZXQtd29ydGgtY2hhcnQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtYW5kLW1vcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVv90h2WMw7_4yXuvFvGDLlzhRQRUn1jj223BWdeKJX5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fnew-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/new-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more">Monarch expanded on the net worth graph</a>, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time.</p> 
<p>On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.mx.com/">MX</a> and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://help.simplifimoney.com/en/articles/8545901-how-to-import-transactions-from-mint">has a Chrome extension</a> for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data.</p> 
<p>Additionally, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9zeW5jLXlvdXItYXBwbGUtY2FyZC1hcHBsZS1jYXNoLWFuZC1zYXZpbmdzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3N5bmMteW91ci1hcHBsZS1jYXJkLWFwcGxlLWNhc2gtYW5kLXNhdmluZ3MifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX0braGlEY1h2EHzEVeCqtzANy-Xa-2RelG8k1e75rFW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fsync-your-apple-card-apple-cash-and-savings" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/sync-your-apple-card-apple-cash-and-savings">Monarch</a> just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It's not the only one either; currently, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/copilotmoney/status/1765099126595764288">Copilot</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:YNAB;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b2df7bfa-ff43-44ef-a78c-6e045229e2f8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YNAB&amp;linkText=YNAB&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55bmFiLmNvbS9ibG9nL3luYWItYXBwbGUtd2FsbGV0PyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55bmFiLmNvbS9ibG9nL3luYWItYXBwbGUtd2FsbGV0PyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb0hLCO0fajT5k7FD62mlqPyFHmvI2Sjsi-tsuMQzQ2N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ynab.com%2Fblog%2Fynab-apple-wallet%3F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.ynab.com/blog/ynab-apple-wallet?">YNAB</a> have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month.</p> 
<p>Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn't provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://copilot.money/">Copilot Money</a> might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there.</p>

<p>There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses.</p> 
<p>Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing.</p>

<p>Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="mailto:venmo@venmo.com">venmo@venmo.com</a> are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app.</p> 
<p>While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits.</p> 
<p>Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well.</p> 
<p>Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://intelligence.copilot.money/">its website</a>, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year.</p> 
<p>Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark.</p> 
<p> <core-commerce id="39236874c65c492bb3682eddbfa1c0a2" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.nerdwallet.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You may know <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a> as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too.</p> 
<p>Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA).</p>

<p>As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you'll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though.</p> 
<p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says.</p> 
<p>Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring.</p> 
<p>Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay).</p>

A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you.</p> 
<p>Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting.</p> 
<p>The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week).</p> 
<p>My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-how-ynab-gives-me-peace-of-mind-and-keeps-my-money-in-check-140049410.html">penned a respectful rebuttal</a>, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-mint-alternatives-we-tested">Other Mint alternatives we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> 
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-plaid-and-how-does-it-work">What is Plaid and how does it work?</h2> 
<figure> 
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-12/771314a0-9dd8-11ee-bfd6-843fb91c197b" data-uuid="234d7d99-eaf4-394f-a470-272c173de523"> 
 <figcaption></figcaption> 
</figure> 
<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-import-your-financial-data-from-the-mint-app">How to import your financial data from the Mint app</h2> 
<p>Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data.</p> 
<p>To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><p>Sign into Mint.com and hit <strong>Transactions</strong> in the menu on the left side of the screen.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Select an account, or <strong>all accounts</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Scroll down and look for “<strong>export [number] transactions</strong>” in smaller print.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Your CSV file should begin downloading.</p></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-mint-alternatives">How we tested Mint alternatives</h2> 
<p>Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a> myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p>

In 2025, features once exclusive to high-end devices – big batteries, multi-camera arrays, high refresh rate OLED displays and more – have trickled down to more affordable models. Sure, you’ll still need to buy a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html">flagship smartphone</a> to get the best camera or fastest processor, but you don’t need to compromise nearly as much anymore if you’re looking for a great handset at a reasonable price. If you have less than $600 to spend, let us help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-a-midrange-phone">What is a midrange phone?</h2> 
<p>While the term frequently appears in articles and videos, there isn’t an agreed-upon definition for “midrange” beyond a phone that isn’t a flagship or an entry-level option. Most of our recommendations cost between $400 and $600 — any less and you should expect significant compromises. If you have more to spend, you might as well consider flagships like the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html">Apple iPhone 17</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-170040665.html">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> if you want the best smartphone experience. Devices like Pixel phones often sit in this price range too, offering some of the best value for Android buyers.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-midrange-smartphone">What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone</h2> 
<p>Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it’s great.) And if you’re an Android fan, there’s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn’t rule either out.</p> 
<p>Of course, also consider how much you’re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Moreover, manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer with software updates and security updates, so it’s worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras with high megapixel counts? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what’s important to you will make choosing one easier.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-wont-you-get-from-a-midrange-smartphone">What <em>won’t</em> you get from a midrange smartphone?</h2> 
<p>Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones blurs as more upmarket features and functions trickle down to more affordable models. When Engadget first published this guide in 2020, it was tricky to find a $500 phone with waterproofing and 5G. In 2025, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging – and even then, that’s becoming less true.</p> 
<p>One thing your new phone probably won’t come with is a power adapter; many companies have stopped including chargers with all of their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their camera systems have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600 with decent camera quality, selfie performance and software support to keep things running smoothly for years to come..</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-midrange-smartphone-faqs">Midrange smartphone FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-midrange-phones-get-software-updates">How long do midrange phones get software updates?</h3> 
<p>Support varies by brand, but most midrange phones receive around three to five years of software and security updates. Apple tends to support iPhones longer while companies like Google and Samsung now promise several years of Android and security patches for their midrange models. Budget-focused brands might offer less so it’s worth checking the update policy before you buy.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-midrange-phones-good-for-gaming">Are midrange phones good for gaming?</h3> 
<p>Yes, many midrange phones handle gaming well, especially popular titles like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>. They usually include capable processors, though you won’t always get the smoothest performance in the most demanding mobile games or at max settings. If you play casually or stick to less graphically intensive titles a midrange phone will feel more than adequate.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another adorable game that I&#39;ve become completely obsessed with. I came across <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://miaumigames.itch.io/roly-pony"><em>Roly-Pony</em></a> this weekend during a particularly soul-sucking bout of doomscrolling, and it&#39;s turned out to be the perfect little temporary respite from <em>the horrors</em>. (Shoutout to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malicedafirenze.bsky.social/post/3lymxnpo5ps2g">Alice Ruppert</a> of <em>The Mane Quest</em> for always keeping us informed about the latest in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-developers-are-trying-to-make-horse-games-that-dont-suck-its-not-easy-140008337.html">horse games</a>).</p>
<p><em>Roly-Pony</em> is a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://youtu.be/eh_xSyPsEVI?t=191"><em>Suika</em></a>-style game, meaning it involves dropping and stacking round objects in order to create matching pairs that combine to become different, bigger objects. That&#39;ll also clear up space on the board in the process, which is important because, similar to <em>Tetris</em>, you can&#39;t allow the objects to pile too high. In this case, you start with horse treats and keep building on them until you&#39;ve unlocked a bunch of different horses. It&#39;s very simple and <em>very</em> cute, with peaceful music going in the background and a lot of little details that people who love horses will really appreciate.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game is free and playable on both the web and mobile, with a leaderboard so you can see how you rank. I naively thought I would just quickly check this game out (because, horses) and move on after a few minutes, but have instead spent <em>hours</em> this weekend trying to crack the top 10. I&#39;ve now got it bookmarked on both my laptop and my phone, so at this point there&#39;s no end in sight. <em>Roly-Pony</em> is free, but there&#39;s an option to send a few dollars the developers&#39; way on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> if you want to support their work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-horse-themed-browser-puzzle-game-is-an-absolute-delight-and-i-cant-stop-playing-it-214313395.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign is continuing to gain momentum after hitting more than <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-has-hit-a-major-milestone-but-the-fights-just-begun-190431644.html">a million signatures</a> in July. After a July 31st deadline, the movement secured around 1.45 million signatures, which the organizers are currently in the process of verifying. The initiative aims to enact legislation that preserves access to video games, even when developers decide to end support, as seen with Ubisoft when it delisted <em>The Crew</em> and revoked access to players who already purchased the game. There were some early concerns about the potential for falsely-submitted signatures, but the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">latest update</a> from organizers said that early reports show around 97 percent of the signatures are valid.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works_en">European Commission&#39;s website</a>, EU authorities have three months to verify the signatures once they are submitted. After that, the organizers said they will personally deliver the petition to the European Commission. With initial estimates clearing the threshold of one million verified signatures, the following steps involve getting meetings with both the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>From the date of the initiative&#39;s submission, the European Union will get six months to decide what to do regarding the Stop Killing Games movement. There is the possibility of the governing bodies not taking any action at all, but the organizers said they are &quot;preparing to ensure our initiative cannot be ignored.&quot; To prepare for the meetings, the organizers said they will be reaching out to members of Parliament and the Commission, while also trying to counter any misinformation or industry lobbying. For now, the campaign will post more frequent updates on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://discord.gg/TCE6uXwsBe">Discord community</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/">social media channels</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It&#39;s been quite the wait, but the fourth season of <em>The Witcher</em> is almost here. In a teaser shared this weekend, Netflix finally revealed the release date: October 30. The video also provided an extended look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia — a casting change that fans naturally have <em>a lot</em> of feelings about after Henry Cavill won their hearts with his take on the character in the first three seasons. The minute-and-a-half-long clip doesn&#39;t give away too much about season four, but we now have a proper sense of what our new Geralt looks and sounds like.</p>
<p>This season will also see Laurence Fishburne join as Regis, Sharlto Copley as Leo Bonhart and James Purefoy as Skellen. It&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stop-tossing-coins-to-the-witcher-after-season-five-171500284.html"><ins>the second to last season of the Netflix adaptation</ins></a>, and the streaming company has said that the two final seasons will cover the last three books in the series: <em>Baptism of Fire</em>, <em>The Tower of the Swallow</em> and<em> Lady of the Lake</em>. But, fans still have more Witcher content to look forward to yet outside of the show. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-sees-ciri-kicking-butt-014137326.html"><em><ins>The Witcher 4</ins></em></a> (the game) is on the way, though we don&#39;t yet have a release date.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fortunately for Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 owners, the FOMO from Apple&#39;s announcement of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html">AirPods Pro 3</a> last week was short-lived. After introducing the latest Beats ear hook style headphones in February, Apple is introducing new features and updating the heart rate tracking functionality of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/a-beats-headphone-sale-includes-all-time-lows-on-the-solo-4-and-powerbeats-pro-2-144550967.html">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> with the upcoming release of iOS 26.</p>
<p>With the latest iOS upgrade, Powerbeats Pro 2 integrates better with Apple&#39;s Fitness app, giving users more accurate data and the choice of up to 50 different workout types. For Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Fitness+</a> users, the Beats earbuds will also show the heart rate, calories burned and &quot;Burn Bar&quot; metrics in real time. Outside the Fitness app, iOS 26 will bring smaller improvements like being able to use a single earbud for heart rate monitoring, better accuracy when counting steps even when your iPhone isn&#39;t on you and a new algorithm that churns out faster heart rate readings. To make your life easier, the updated Powerbeats Pro 2 will send you a notification to get a better fit for more accurate heart rate monitoring and can sense if you nod or shake your head in response to Siri asking you to answer an incoming call or hear a text.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of these iOS 26 upgrades for the Powerbeats Pro 2 will mostly put it in line with the AirPods Pro 3 features when the update releases on September 15. However, in our review of the Beats earbuds, we found that they offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">mediocre ANC performance</a>. It&#39;s worth noting that Android users for the Powerbeats Pro 2 won&#39;t get many of the Apple-branded features that come with iOS 26.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/some-much-needed-upgrades-are-coming-to-powerbeats-pro-2-with-ios-26-181716994.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-trick-googles-ai-overviews-into-explaining-made-up-idioms-162816472.html">AI Overviews</a> were introduced with a comically <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://theconversation.com/eat-a-rock-a-day-put-glue-on-your-pizza-how-googles-ai-is-losing-touch-with-reality-230953">rocky start</a>, it&#39;s about to face a far more serious challenge. Penske Media, the publisher for <em>Rolling Stone, Variety, Billboard </em>and others, filed a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://chatgptiseatingtheworld.com/2025/09/14/penske-media-v-google-complaint-rolling-stone-owner-sues-google-for-ai-mode-antitrust-claim/">lawsuit</a> against Google, claiming the tech giant illegally powers its AI Overviews feature with content from its sites. Penske claimed in the lawsuit that the AI feature is also &quot;siphoning and discouraging user traffic to PMC&#39;s and other publishers&#39; websites,&quot; adding that &quot;the revenue generated by those visits will decline.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC&#39;s federal district court, claims that about 20 percent of Google searches that link to one of Penske&#39;s sites now have AI Overviews. The media company argued that this percentage will continue to increase and that its affiliate revenue through 2024 dropped by more than a third from its peak. Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said that the tech giant will &quot;defend against these meritless claims&quot; and that &quot;AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this year, Google faced a similar lawsuit from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/educational-tech-company-chegg-sues-google-over-ai-overviews-133017759.html">Chegg</a>, an educational tech company that&#39;s known for textbook rentals. Like Penske Media, this lawsuit alleged that Google&#39;s AI Overviews hurt website traffic and revenue for Chegg. However, the Penske lawsuit is the first time that Google has faced legal action from a major US publisher about its AI search capabilities.</p>
<p>Beyond Google&#39;s legal troubles, other AI companies have also been facing their own court cases.

<p>The Family Plan allows six different users to access the platform. It offers cross-device support and each user is tied to an Apple ID, so their favorite music won't mess with anyone else's algorithm.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Apple Music actually topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html">best music streaming platforms</a>, and for good reason. It sounds great and it's easy to use. What else is there? All music is available in CD quality or higher and there are plenty of personalized playlists and the like. The platform also operates a number of live radio stations, which is fun.</p> 
<p>The service is available for Android devices, but it really shines on Apple products. To that end, the web and Windows PC apps aren’t as polished as the iOS version. It doesn't <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2025/01/streaming-payouts-hit-new-low-artists-earn/">pay artists properly</a>, but that's true of every music streaming platform. Apple Music does pay out more than Spotify, but that's an incredibly low bar.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A California bill that would require operating system and app store providers to verify users&#39; ages before they can download apps has cleared the Assembly 58-0, and will now move on to Gov. Gavin Newsom, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/13/california-advances-effort-to-check-kids-ages-online-amid-safety-concerns-00563005"><em><ins>Politico</ins></em></a> reports. The Digital Age Assurance Act (AB 1043), introduced by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, does not require photo identification for verification, but puts the onus on the platforms to provide tools for parents to indicate the user&#39;s age during a device&#39;s setup, and use this information steer kids toward age-appropriate content and screen time.</p>
<p>It comes after <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/utah-just-became-the-first-state-in-the-country-to-pass-an-age-verification-law-for-app-stores-225846117.html"><ins>Utah</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-enacts-age-verification-law-for-app-stores-190603522.html"><ins>Texas</ins></a> both adopted app store age verification laws earlier this year that have been criticized as posing potential privacy risks, and faced opposition from the likes of Google and Apple. The California bill has been received more positively by Big Tech, with Google, Meta and others putting out <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://a14.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250909-google-meta-among-tech-leaders-and-child-advocates-voicing-support-wicks"><ins>statements</ins></a> in support of it in the leadup to a Senate vote on Friday. Kareem Ghanem, Google&#39;s Senior Director of Government Affairs &amp; Public Policy, called the bill &quot;one of the most thoughtful approaches we’ve seen thus far to the challenges of keeping kids safe, recognizing that it’s a shared responsibility across the ecosystem.” Gov. Newsom now has until October 13 to sign or veto the bill, according to <em>Politico</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following her son&#39;s suicide, Becca Dallas filed a potentially groundbreaking lawsuit against <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-is-adding-an-age-estimation-feature-for-teens-110047092.html">Roblox</a> and Discord, accusing the platforms of wrongful death. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/technology/roblox-lawsuit-child-safety.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the lawsuit recounts the events leading up to Ethan Dallas&#39; death, detailing his interactions with a player named Nate. According to the report, Nate was likely a 37-year-old man named Timothy O&#39;Connor, who was previously arrested on charges of &quot;possessing child pornography and transmitting harmful material to minors.&quot; The report added that Ethan opened up about these incidents to his mom before committing suicide four months after the confession.</p>
<p>The lawsuit could be the first of its kind against Roblox, according to <em>NYTimes</em>, considering it attributes some blame to the gaming platform that&#39;s home to tens of millions of underaged players. In a statement responding to the report, a Roblox spokesperson said that child safety issues are seen across the industry and that the company was working on new safety features, while also complying with law enforcement.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Roblox has faced complaints of being a dangerous place for underage players.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tale-of-four-kodaks-173040742.html">Kodak</a> has shrunk a camera to fit onto a keyring, but it still manages to shoot both photo and video. It&#39;s hard not to compare the Kodak Charmera to the ubiquitous Labubu craze, considering the highly collectible nature of Reto Pro selling these officially licensed mini cameras as a single blind box for $29.99 or a full set of six for $179.94. The keyring cameras, which only weigh 30 grams, are already sold out on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kodak.retopro.co/products/kodak-charmera-br-keychain-digital-camera-blind-box">Reto Pro website</a>, but are expected to be restocked.</p>
<p>The blind box can be unwrapped for one of seven designs, including one secret version that has a transparent shell to show off the tiny camera&#39;s internals. According to the website, the basic style odds are one out of six, while the secret edition has a probability of one out of 48. Whichever design you get, each Charmera comes with a keyring to Labubu-bify it to your belt loop or bag and a USB-C cable to export your photos or videos to other devices.</p>

Nobody should expect any ultrasharp images, but you can customize your shots with Kodak frames, vintage filters and a date stamp. We&#39;re not expecting the Charmera to deliver the highest-quality images, but just like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/this-nifty-fan-made-game-boy-camera-is-the-size-of-a-cartridge-185209536.html">Gameboy Camera</a>, that won&#39;t make it any less fun to use.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/kodaks-mini-camera-fits-on-your-keyring-and-is-smaller-than-an-airpods-case-184227505.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Long Range model represented the most affordable Cybertruck option with its starting price of $69,990, but visitors to Tesla&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#overview">online configurator</a> can now only choose between the all-wheel drive model that starts at $79,990 and the Cyberbeast trim, which goes for at least $114,990.</p>
<p>Tesla launched the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-70000-rwd-cybertruck-arrives-with-some-key-features-removed-120044840.html">Long Range version</a> of the Cybertruck in April, which arrived at $10,000 more than originally expected. Along with an elevated price tag, Tesla removed several features, including the power tonneau cover, adaptive suspension, a touchscreen for the back row, the rear lightbar and outlets in the truck bed. The RWD version also came with less towing power, a lower payload capacity and only one motor. While unrelated, the federal tax credit for EV buyers in the US is coming to a close at the end of the month, making the purchase of a Long Range model even less of a bargain.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla didn&#39;t officially offer any explanation about the removal of the Long Range option from its website, but it could be attributed to low Cybertruck sales overall. According to a report from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2025-ev-sales/">Cox Automotive</a>, the parent company of Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, Tesla only sold 4,306 Cybertrucks in the second quarter of the year, which is a more than 50 percent drop in sales during the same time period last year.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-can-automatically-let-a-trusted-friend-know-you-got-home-safe-130010806.html">Snapchat</a> has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/infiniteretentionandgroupstreaks">introduced</a> a couple of new features it says are &quot;highly requested&quot; by its users. The first is &quot;Infinite Retention,&quot; which as its name implies will allow you to keep a chat history like you could on a messaging app and prevent your messages from disappearing. &quot;We’ve often heard from our community that Snapchatters want to save their chats forever and wish they could build streaks with their favorite groups,&quot; its announcement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app has been testing the feature <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/infinite-retention-mode">since 2024</a>, and now it&#39;s being rolled out broadly. You could already save messages in the app by tapping on them inside the chat, but this one makes things easier. It&#39;s a setting you&#39;ll just have to switch on or off for each conversation. If you enable the setting, the other person in the conversation will get a notification that you did, and they will be able to switch it off if they want. You can, for instance, switch Infinite Retention on for a close friend but keep it off for acquaintances.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Snapchat is rolling out Group Streaks that will let you contribute to a collective Streak with your friends. To keep up individual Streaks, you&#39;ll have to send and receive at least one photo or video Snap with a friend every day. Group Streaks are easier to keep going, since several people can participate. You can also restore a Group Streak within a week in case it ends.&nbsp;</p>

These earbuds remain our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html">best budget wireless earbuds</a>.</p> 
<p>The most significant feature on the A40 earbuds is the inclusion of active noise cancellation (ANC), which is almost unheard of at this price point. It's not the most sophisticated ANC, but it does sufficiently reduce constant rumbling background noise like on a plane. The built-in mic that's used for transparency mode and phone calls is a bit subpar, especially when used in noisy areas.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="fc90f51482e440699fabd2aa552d889e" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Auto-Adjustable-Cancelling-Wireless-Headphone/dp/B0B1LVC5VZ?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>These are budget-friendly, so while they can't be expected to compete on audio quality with flagship headphones that cost hundreds of dollars, the sound is still impressive given their low cost. The sound profile is warm, with a strong upper-bass, while some of the higher frequencies lose finer details. For those wanting to fine-tune the sound on the A40s, the earbuds can be paired with the Soundcore app, which includes an EQ.</p> 
<p>The small, round earpieces help make the A40s comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the charging case extends the already solid 10-hour battery life by another 50 or so hours. The Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds are already one of the best value options on the market, and this sale makes them even more appealing.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-white-house-reportedly-ordered-xais-grok-to-be-approved-for-government-use-165625891.html">xAI</a> has laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team, the company&#39;s largest, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-layoffs-data-annotators-2025-9"><em>Business Insider</em></a>. The annotation team is in charge of categorizing and contextualizing raw data used to train Grok so that it can understand the world better. <em>Business Insider </em>says the laid off employees were informed via email on the evening of September 12, Friday, that it was going to downsize its team of general AI tutors. They were reportedly told that they would be paid their salaries until the end of their contracts on November 30, but their access to xAI&#39;s systems had been cut off after they received the notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-xai-lays-off-hundreds-data-annotators-business-insider-reports-2025-09-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a> asked the company for a comment, it referred to a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/xai/status/1966677385056841884">post on X</a> wherein it posted a call for specialist AI tutors instead. xAI said that it will &quot;immediately surge [its] Specialist AI tutor team by 10x&quot; and that it&#39;s hiring across STEM fields. As specialist tutors, the new hires will be &quot;enhancing [the company&#39;s] AI technologies through high-quality inputs, labels and annotations using specialized software.&quot; They&#39;ll gather data and provide their own, not only in text format, but also through audio recordings and video sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>Reuters</em> has noted, the layoffs come after several high-profile departures from xAI, including the company&#39;s chief financial officer Mike Liberatore. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-must-spent-almost-an-hour-talking-about-grok-without-mentioning-its-nazi-problem-061101656.html">launched Grok 4</a> in July, calling it the &quot;smartest AI in the world.&quot; Elon Musk claimed during the model&#39;s reveal that if you make Grok 4 take the SATs and the GREs, it would get near perfect results every time and can answer questions it&#39;s never seen before. He also proclaimed that Grok is going to invent new tech maybe later this year, and that he would be shocked if it doesn&#39;t happen next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/xai-reportedly-laid-off-at-least-500-ai-tutors-working-on-grok-130059624.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our latest recap of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. This week, the revived Acclaim held a very fun showcase (and we&#39;ll get to some of the games from that). But on Friday, Nintendo soaked up all the attention with an hour-long Direct. Sure, it included some first-party games, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-tennis-fever-hits-the-court-on-february-12-134227490.html"><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-will-be-released-on-december-4-for-switch-1-and-2-134718933.html"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-is-getting-a-dlc-expansion-today-140016430.html"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>expansion. But Nintendo highlighted several indie games in the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-metroid-virtual-boy-and-more-all-the-biggest-announcements-from-todays-nintendo-direct-165722897.html">newsy showcase</a>, too.</p>
<p><em>Hades 2</em> is arguably the highest-profile name among those, and the full version isn&#39;t far away at all — it&#39;ll hit Switch, Switch 2, Steam and Epic Games Store <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html">on September 25</a>. <em>Stardew Valley, Human Fall Flat, Overcooked 2 </em>and <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> are getting Switch 2 versions as well.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="447eb5e0e7a6441a8c1eaff6247e24a0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ex2cdvYWB7o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a Nintendo Direct without a shadowdrop. Sure enough, <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em> landed on <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lynked-banner-of-the-spark-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">Switch and Switch 2</a> on Friday, with mouse control and GameShare support on the newer system. This is an action RPG from FuzzyBot and publisher <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dreamhavens-tabletop-rpg-party-game-sunderfolk-arrives-on-april-23-183006473.html">Dreamhaven</a> that looks a bit like a cross between <em>Hades </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve had <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em> sitting on my PC for months. I&#39;m definitely interested in checking it out, but it&#39;s just one of those things that&#39;s unfortunately slipped further and further down my to-play list. I&#39;m still hoping to carve out time to properly check it out before it&#39;s time to start putting together our games of the year list.</p>
<div id="688676ec9ea04e06bd4d8b08a53ba8fe"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fM1aD2YvA4c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>Popucom </em>(which debuted on <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543180/POPUCOM/">Steam</a> earlier this year) also looks pretty intriguing. From Hypergryph and publisher Gryph Frontier, this is a multiplayer-only adventure platformer in which you take out enemies with match three-style shooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the twist: each player only has two colors, so you&#39;ll need to work together to fire the correct blobs at bad guys and obstacles. <em>Popucom </em>is coming to Switch this holiday season.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2>

<p><em>Little Problems: A Cozy Detective Game </em>is a new title from the small team at female-led Indonesian developer Posh Cat Studio and publisher Amplified Games. As the name suggests, it&#39;s a slice-of-life detective game that sees you getting to the bottom of misunderstandings and minor inconveniences.</p>
<p>You play as freshman student Mary, and one of the first mysteries you&#39;ll have to solve involves finding the location where her study group is supposed to meet after she forgets where to go on her first day of school. The game has 10 cases overall and each has a set of puzzles to solve. It&#39;s said to have &quot;simple mechanics that grow into playful twists and surprising solutions.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Little Problems </em>seems quite charming and just the kind of low-fi puzzle game that I might vibe with. It&#39;s out now on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2653470/Little_Problems_A_Cozy_Detective_Game/">Steam</a> and it usually costs $10, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until September 23.</p>
<div id="913452870a134306aab6a9e6d4bb9a90"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0boLooPF0g8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Disc golf feels like it would be a fun sport to get into and while there are a few courses near me, they&#39;re not exactly easy to get to without a car. So I might just have to make do with <em>Disc Golf City</em>, which came out of early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3753060/Disc_Golf_City/">Steam</a> for PC, Mac and Linux this week. The action takes place in a colorful city, and you can bounce your disc off of objects in the environment to pull off trick shots and try to land it in the basket.</p>
<p><em>Disc Golf City</em>, which is from Agapo Games, costs $13. There&#39;s also a demo you can check out.</p>
<div id="fa69fc44f5484be185d7cebb2c9e1ae4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VwIe6AtJPxg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Another game that came out of early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1665260/Beyond_Sunset/">Steam</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:GOG.com;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e3b8e5db-8fee-44fd-9fa6-1e45522ece33&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;linkText=GOG&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvYmV5b25kX3N1bnNldCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTNiOGU1ZGItOGZlZS00NGZkLTlmYTYtMWU0NTUyMmVjZTMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvYmV5b25kX3N1bnNldCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUYFqmSUVkDSz6kmqAbAxbtLVSm7DxZIJnXReYnev1fb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbeyond_sunset" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.gog.com/en/game/beyond_sunset">GOG</a> this week is <em>Beyond Sunset</em>. This is a cyberpunk (not that one) first-person shooter with RPG elements from Metacorp / Vaporware and publisher Movie Games.</p>
<p>I love when a vaporwave color palette is put to good use and the lo-fi visuals here just feel right. The fast-paced movement looks pretty interesting too — it&#39;s not hard to tell that the developers took inspiration from the Doom series. <em>Beyond Sunset</em> costs $10.</p>

<p>It feels like I can&#39;t go on the internet for five minutes without learning about a new sidescrolling Metroidvania game. Still, <em>Katanaut </em>is one I&#39;ve had my eye on for a while. You&#39;ll be facing the horrors that have taken over a space station using an array of weapons, skills and perks.</p>
<p>This is a roguelite from Voidmaw in which there are new pathways to explore on each run. There is some permanent progression here, as you&#39;ll pick up memory fragments during your journey through the station&#39;s gore-soaked corridors. It was also revealed this week that Acclaim is the publisher of <em>Katanaut</em>, which is available on <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">Steam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming</h2>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/"><em>Pacific Drive</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was one of the more interesting-looking games from last year that I just haven&#39;t gotten around to checking out yet. It&#39;s a driving sim and survival horror game set in a supernatural version of the Pacific Northwest, in which you scour the landscape for parts to upgrade your car and, hopefully, stay alive.</p>
<p>Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive this week announced the <em>Whispers in the Woods </em>expansion for <em>Pacific Drive</em>. Slated to arrive later this year, the DLC adds around eight to 12 hours of gameplay with new characters, dangers, mysteries and anomalies to encounter. Other updates include route modifiers and garage cosmetics to find.</p>
<div id="b72b4704aa7f46fc942aea04b9e319d5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TATp91aZGe0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>The rest of this week&#39;s upcoming games are all from Acclaim, since I found just about everything in that showcase intriguing. The first game that the publisher showed off was <em>GridBeat</em> from Ridiculous Games.</p>
<p>Blending together puzzles, tactics and dungeon crawling, <em>GridBeat </em>will see you infiltrate a corporate computer network and try to escape with valuable data while security programs and malware attempt to stop you. You&#39;ll find more abilities and power-ups along the way. Crucially, you need to move in time to the music, since it&#39;s a rhythm game as well. There&#39;s a lot going on here! <em>GridBeat </em>is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">Steam</a>, but there&#39;s no release window as yet.</p>
<div id="56c08455d22f41908cb3b65cde3cbbe1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_CRBRrUClc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>One thing I was really hoping to see during Acclaim&#39;s showcase was the return of NBA Jam. We didn&#39;t quite get that, but I&#39;ll absolutely take <em>Basketball Classics</em> in its place. Acclaim has taken over publishing duties for this retro, NES-style arcade basketball title from Namo Gamo. It features 5-on-5 sidescrolling action with simplified controls, hundreds of teams, more than 1,000 players and multiple modes (including couch multiplayer).</p>
<p>I hadn&#39;t heard of <em>Basketball Classics</em> until now, but it&#39;s been out on <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819630/Basketball_Classics/?curator_clanid=45592194">Steam</a> for several years. Acclaim is helping to bring it to consoles sometime soon.</p>

<p>I do love <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>and am looking forward to the sequel. <em>Pixel Washer </em>looks like a different flavor of that format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a cute lil&#39; piggy with a power washer, you&#39;ll be cleaning just about everything in sight. The trailer suggests that things might get weird, and it even seems like there are boss fights. Valadria is the developer behind Pixel Washer, which is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2572060/Pixel_Washer/">Steam</a> down the line.</p>
<div id="79c7bac3fb9c4e9888855af17118cdb9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hH9sIotgOk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate </em>looks like the offspring of SSX and <em>Jet Set Radio, </em>and that&#39;s enough to sell me on the game. An easy addition to my wishlist.</p>
<p>Wabisabi Design is making this snowboarding game that pits you against NPCs and/or human players in races. In the main game mode, you&#39;ll need to complete a certain number of challenges in each level before you can move on, which is very much keeping in with the Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater format. There&#39;s also a relaxing endless mode, where you can just hang out and explore or, like, whatever.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta Connect, the company&#39;s annual event dedicated to all things AR, VR, AI and the metaverse is just days away. And once again, it seems like it will be a big year for smart glasses and AI.</p>
<p>This year, the event will take a slightly different format than in the past. Mark Zuckerberg is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/connect/agenda/"><ins>scheduled</ins></a> to kick things off with an evening keynote at 5PM PT on Wednesday, September 17. A developer keynote with other executives will take place the next morning on September 18, beginning at 10AM, with more talks and developer sessions to follow.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear why Meta changed things up this year, but it is shaping up to be a particularly eventful year for Connect. We&#39;re expecting two new models of smart glasses, including Meta&#39;s first to have a display, as well as new Meta AI and metaverse updates. As usual, Engadget will be reporting live from Zuckerberg&#39;s keynote at Meta HQ, but until then, here&#39;s a closer look at what&#39;s coming and what to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-new-and-updated-smart-glasses">New and updated smart glasses</h2>
<p>The biggest news of the day will be Meta&#39;s next-generation of smart glasses. The frames, often referred to by their reported internal name &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/report-meta-could-release-its-first-true-ar-headset-as-soon-as-2027-222502610.html"><ins>Hypernova</ins></a>,&quot; will be the first consumer-ready glasses from Meta that have a display. We already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks.</p>
<p>While the frames are expected to have a small display on one side, they won&#39;t offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we&#39;ve seen on Meta&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html"><ins>Orion prototype</ins></a>. Instead the display will allow you to view things like notifications and photo previews. The glasses will also come with a dedicated wristband, similar to what the company showed off with Orion, that allows the wearer to control specific features through hand gestures.</p>

<p>The glasses, which may officially be called &quot;Celeste,&quot; are expected to go on sale later this year, will likely cost around $800. They could be sold with Prada branding, which would be in line with Meta&#39;s longtime EssilorLuxottica partnership, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html"><ins>according to</ins></a> <em>CNBC.</em> Given the much higher price tag — most of Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban-branded glasses cost around $300 — it seems Meta is positioning this as a higher-end product that will have a more limited appeal. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658"><ins>suggested</ins></a> Hypernova will have a &quot;negligible&quot; share of the overall smart glasses market.</p>
<p>It also sounds like we could see a new version of Meta&#39;s smart glasses without a display with an updated version of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. There could be two versions for sunglasses and clear frames, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/renders-of-next-gen-ray-ban-meta-glasses-leak/"><ins>leaked renders</ins></a>. The new glasses are reported to have improved cameras and battery life, and support new AI capabilities.</p>
<p>We could also see new third-party glasses integrations. As <em>UploadVR </em>recently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-agenda-reveals-smart-glasses-sdk/"><ins>pointed out,</ins></a> early versions of the Connect schedule for developers seemingly confirms that Meta is getting ready to give developers access to its smart glasses. Up to now, the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within Meta&#39;s ecosystem (with a few exceptions like Spotify and Audible). Allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-meta-ai">Meta AI</h2>
<p>As with other recent years, AI will be a major theme throughout. Meta AI has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-already-has-1-billion-active-users-120023875.html"><ins>a billion</ins></a> monthly users (something Zuckerberg will surely remind us of) and I&#39;m expecting to see new features for Meta AI both on the company&#39;s glasses and within its apps. <em>Business Insider</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-hires-contractors-build-ai-chatbot-characters-key-markets-2025-9"><ins>reports</ins></a> the company has been working on new lineup of non-English speaking &quot;character-driven&quot; bots for its apps. (Meta&#39;s character-centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny, with the company <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-re-training-its-ai-so-it-wont-discuss-self-harm-or-have-romantic-conversations-with-teens-182418587.html">recently blocking</a> teens&#39; access to many user-generated characters amid growing safety concerns.)</p>
<p>Outside of Meta&#39;s chatbots, I&#39;m hoping Zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create &quot;superintelligence.&quot; As I wrote in July, his <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html"><ins>initial manifesto</ins></a> that outlined his vision was confusing at best. The CEO has recently reorganized Meta&#39;s AI teams around the idea, and has been on a very expensive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-invests-148-billion-in-scale-ai-and-recruits-its-ceo-130029612.html"><ins>hiring spree</ins></a> to recruit executives and researchers for the effort.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zuckerberg could use Connect to shore up expectations around its Llama models. The company&#39;s larger Llama 4 model has <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-behemoth-llama-4-model-might-still-be-months-away-221240585.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc"><ins>been delayed</ins></a> and reports suggest Meta&#39;s engineers have been struggling to improve it. There are other signs that Zuckerberg may be <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html"><ins>backing away</ins></a> from open-source AI.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-the-metaverse">What about the metaverse?</h2>
<p>While the metaverse has taken somewhat of a backseat to AI in recent years, it wouldn&#39;t be Connect without some VR-related news. In a recent Instagram post, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth teased &quot;metaverse software&quot; updates related to Horizon Worlds at Connect. The company recently offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-ai-powered-npcs-to-the-metaverse-231605236.html"><ins>a preview</ins></a> to developers of its plan to bring AI-powered NPCs to the metaverse, and I expect we&#39;ll hear more about how generative AI could help shape the metaverse.</p>
<p>And while there are no new Quest headsets expected, we could hear more about those third-party VR headsets that will run Meta&#39;s VR software. Last year, the company announced that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-opens-quest-os-to-third-parties-including-asus-and-lenovo-163127396.html"><ins>ASUS, Lenovo and Xbox</ins></a> were working on Meta Horizon OS headsets. We haven&#39;t heard too much about these devices since, but there was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1878470166360580199"><ins>a leak earlier</ins></a> this year that suggested ASUS would be the first to launch, and that it would include face and eye tracking features.</p>

<p>&quot;People were complaining about getting less reach with their Stories if they posted lots of Stories in the same day,&quot; Mosseri said in a video announcing the change. &quot;That is not at all the intended behavior of Instagram.&quot; Fixing the bug doesn&#39;t mean every Story you add will be watched, but Mosseri says posting multiple Stories a day won&#39;t negatively impact the reach of your Stories overall, especially your first Story.</p>

<p>For anyone who primarily uses Instagram to keep up with their friends, the change might not matter all that much. But much like YouTube, Instagram is an increasingly professionalized platform where people post in the hopes of expanding their reach and earning a living off their content. That creates an interesting dynamic between Mosseri&#39;s regular announcements and users trying to suss out the nuances of the platform&#39;s algorithm. For every new feature, like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-stories-are-getting-comments-183051677.html">adding of comments to Stories</a>, there&#39;s subtler tweaks that can totally change creators&#39; content strategy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-fixed-an-issue-that-caused-posting-multiple-stories-to-tank-your-reach-184714482.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fans will have to wait a little bit longer for the hotly-anticipated <em>Balatro</em> 1.1 update. Developer LocalThunk just announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">it will not be coming out in 2025</a>, despite previously promising a release this year. Instead, it&#39;ll come out &quot;when it&#39;s done.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth remembering that <em>Balatro</em> was created by a single person, and the same goes for this update. The lone developer also made the original balance patch and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-is-an-almost-perfect-mobile-port-163050971.html">well-regarded mobile port</a>. He says he&#39;s &quot;well and truly burned out.&quot;</p>

<p>LocalThunk apologizes for the delay and says &quot;it has become clear now that it won&#39;t happen by the end of the year.&quot; It&#39;s actually nice to let us know now instead of forcing us to wonder where the update is for the next several months.</p>
<p>&quot;I still consider this my hobby,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Now for some good news. The update is definitely coming, just not right now. It&#39;ll be free for all players on all platforms. The developer also hinted that this update would not be the final DLC drop for the game.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Balatro</em> is a deckbuilding roguelike that&#39;s loosely based on poker. Consider it the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-balatro-of-the-year-2024-140021833.html">highly addictive sequel to poker</a> we never knew we needed. It has proven to be a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-is-about-to-hook-a-lot-more-players-now-that-its-on-game-pass-192958603.html">bona-fide phenomenon</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatros-big-2025-update-wont-be-coming-out-this-year-after-all-183511401.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Whenever there&#39;s a Nintendo Direct in September, you can be pretty sure that it&#39;ll be a major edition of the showcase. Given that Friday&#39;s one was scheduled to be <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-hour-long-nintendo-direct-is-set-for-september-12-135935134.html">about an hour long</a> and that Nintendo has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">a whole new console to put games on</a>, it was already likely that there was going to be a lot of news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even then, it managed to be a jam-packed Direct. Let&#39;s take a look at all the biggest announcements from the showcase, including what&#39;s obviously the most important one: a Switch 2 version of <em>Overcooked 2</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-marios-40th-anniversary">Mario&#39;s 40th anniversary</h2>
<div id="d37dd8d6d4514138aa8a53e2cf810fe4"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>September 13 is the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>in Japan, which is a big reason why this Direct took place on a Friday (a highly unusual day for Nintendo to hold one of its showcases). Following news of Mario-related updates for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-museum-japan-095739941.html">Nintendo Museum in Kyoto</a>, the company revealed the title for the next Mario movie. It&#39;s called <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-be-marios-next-crack-at-the-big-screen-130840015.html"><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, and it&#39;s coming to cinemas in the US on April 3. We&#39;ll have to wait a little longer for a trailer, though.</p>
<p>There was no announcement of an upcoming 3D Mario game today, unfortunately, but there was still plenty of other news. <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-tennis-fever-hits-the-court-on-february-12-134227490.html"><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a> is coming to Switch 2 in February as the first new Mario Tennis game since 2018. Yoshi&#39;s getting another adventure of his own with the Switch 2 platformer <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-is-a-new-platformer-coming-to-the-switch-2-next-spring-133805615.html"><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></a>, which is set to arrive next spring. A Switch 2 version of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/super-mario-bros-wonder-is-getting-a-switch-2-version-with-new-multiplayer-modes-133722013.html"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> with fresh multiplayer modes will drop around that time too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before all of that, though, Nintendo is bringing the wonderful Wii games <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>and <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2 </em>to Switch on October 2. They&#39;ll be available separately or as a bundle on the eShop and as a combined edition on a $70 physical cartridge. On Switch 2, you&#39;ll be able to play these two classics in 4K.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures are coming in April as well. Even though I&#39;m not typically an Amiibo collector, I really want those because Luma is just adorable. In addition, Nintendo plans to release a physical collectible of the Talking Flower from <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>next spring.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-out-today">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC out today</h2>
<div id="9f523c306fc240409743362b566c83d5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44xycnG2mKo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>If you&#39;ve already smashed everything to smithereens in <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendos-latest-3d-platformer-is-an-instant-classic-143048108.html"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and have been yearning for more to do in one of the biggest Switch 2 exclusives to date, you&#39;re in luck. Nintendo revealed a paid expansion for the platformer during the Direct. It&#39;s called <em>DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush </em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-is-getting-a-dlc-expansion-today-140016430.html">it&#39;s out today for $20</a>.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll be able to barrel around Donkey Kong&#39;s home island and meet up with some familiar faces. After you&#39;ve beaten the story in the main game, you&#39;ll be able to try the Emerald Rush mode. This will see you undertaking timed runs in DK Island and the main game&#39;s layers to collect emerald ore, smash fossils and collect Banandium Gems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has released a demo for the main game. So, if you have a Switch 2 and haven&#39;t played <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>yet, you&#39;ll be able to find out for yourself why the other cool kids are saying &quot;ooh, banana!&quot; all the time.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</h2>
<div id="373cbb46432946058ec90739f5d9fbe1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_bYri9p1Uk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Quite a few people were expecting/hoping for news of a new Animal Crossing during the Nintendo Direct. While that didn&#39;t happen, Nintendo had arguably something even more exciting to announce — especially if you&#39;re both an Animal Crossing and Pokémon fan.</p>
<p><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>is the first Pokémon life simulation game. You&#39;ll play as a Ditto who has been transformed to look like a human and turn empty land into a cozy paradise for both yourself and Pokémon. Ditto can learn abilities from Pokémon, such as using Squirtle’s Water Gun to give life to flora.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks utterly lovely. <em>Pokémon Pokopia </em>is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune&#39;s Weave</h2>
<div id="cd2c5746c28b4804b7ea6d7c5c9585a9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Nintendo used this Direct to seriously start filling out its Switch 2 slate for 2026. One of the games it&#39;s publishing for the system next year is a new entry in the Fire Emblem series. It announced <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-comes-out-for-the-switch-2-in-2026-162127483.html"><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#39;s Weave</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>during the showcase.</p>
<p>As ever, this will be a turn-based tactical RPG. The debut trailer touched on the story and characters in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-metroid-prime-4-and-hades-2-release-dates">Metroid Prime 4 and Hades 2 release dates</h2>
<div id="6b683837dc614869b795cddb123b7d2f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJNCNswbdG0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>We had a feeling these were coming soon, but release dates for both <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Hades 2</em> were both major announcements during the Direct. Samus has a rad, Tron-esque bike in <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-will-be-released-on-december-4-for-switch-1-and-2-134718933.html">on December 4</a>.</p>
<p><em>Hades 2</em>, meanwhile, will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html">on September 25</a>. The full game will be available on Steam and Epic Games Store on the same day as it will exit early access on PC. There were be cross-save support across PC and Switch/Switch 2. The Switch 2 version will support 120fps gameplay when the console is docked. That <em>Hades 2 </em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-should-give-you-a-chance-against-its-early-bosses-134125593.html"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>are dropping in the same month is pretty wild. Apologies to any designs you had on getting some sleep in September.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment release date</h2>
<div id="ed478ee232794ec0bdf060f8674988ec"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuSV9Sy28Mw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>

<p>Nintendo announced <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment </em>during a dedicated launch direct for Switch 2 back in April, and now there&#39;s a release date for this hack and slash game. It&#39;s coming to the console on November 6.</p>
<p><em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, which was developed by Koei Tecmo&#39;s AAA Games Studio, sees Princess Zelda traveling back in time and meeting Rauro and Sonia, the first king and queen of Hyrule. You&#39;ll try to take down Ganondorf (yes, again) in what&#39;s known as the Imprisoning War. Zonai devices will be at your disposal. According to the trailer, you&#39;ll &quot;uncover ancient truths that were only glimpsed in <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-familiar-but-fresh-adventure-120035307.html"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s two-player co-op support via split-screen and <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-lets-switch-2-players-share-their-games-132431186.html">GameShare</a>. Zelda, Rauru and Sonia are among the playable characters, and you&#39;ll be able to swap between them. You can also play as a Korok for a change instead of torturing the poor creatures, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpBBypN5Suw">you monsters</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-aaa-third-party-games-coming-to-switch-2">AAA third-party games coming to Switch 2</h2>
<div id="3f29e72247eb4abf9f874e00ed98aefb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6a8gK0YdUpY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Nintendo confirmed during the Direct that <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> is coming to Switch 2. It&#39;ll arrive on February 27, the same day the next entry in Capcom&#39;s classic survival horror series debuts on other platforms. <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>will also land on Switch on on February 27.</p>
<p>We learned back in April that the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy was bound for Switch 2 and now there&#39;s a release date for that. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> is coming to the system on January 22.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-switch-2-versions-of-indie-classics">Switch 2 versions of indie classics</h2>
<div id="c9949b91abb549369628f8616607cc23"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci9jNv_L3VE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Nintendo Switch was such an important platform for indie games, and several that became huge hits are getting Switch 2 versions. <em>Overcooked 2 </em>(the ultimate relationship test, in my opinion) will have support for 4K visuals, 60fps gameplay, GameShare and CameraPlay — the feature that allows you to see you and your teammate&#39;s faces on screen as you play —in its Switch 2 version. That&#39;s on the way this holiday season.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/stardew-valley-is-getting-yet-another-surprise-update-161805119.html"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> will also support GameShare for co-op play on Switch 2. Mouse controls will be available, as well as four-player splitscreen and eight-player online action. Those who have the game on Switch already will get a free upgrade when the Switch 2 version arrives this fall.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/soon-youll-be-able-to-fling-around-the-klutzy-schlub-in-human-fall-flat-on-vr-212033104.html"><em>Human Fall Flat</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is headed to Switch 2 in Spring 2026. That will also have support for mouse controls, GameShare and eight-person multiplayer.</p>
<p>It&#39;s far too early to say whether <em>Powerwash Simulator 2</em> will become an indie classic, but the original game was terrific and its sequel is getting a Switch 2 version as well. There&#39;s no exact release date for <em>Powerwash Simulator 2 </em>as yet, but it&#39;s still <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/powerwash-simulator-2-will-arrive-later-this-year-164534571.html">slated to arrive this fall</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-suika-game-gets-a-sequel">Suika Game gets a sequel</h2>
<div id="422e2a0ce99340539d602a468fc0b6fc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51w_Eyf1vKM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p><em>Suika Game </em>was a huge hit, and the sequel promises to soak up even more of my time. <em>Suika Game Planet </em>adds an extra dimension to the puzzle action. Instead of dropping fruit into a bucket and trying to combine two of the same items into a larger one, this time there&#39;s a circular stage. That might be a fun wrinkle for anyone (me, hi) who gets frustrated about not being able to reach large fruit at the bottom of the container.</p>
<p><em>Suika Game Planet </em>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 this winter and I might not be able to do anything else with my time after it drops. The Switch 2 version will support a GameShare mode that allows up to four players to work together.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Nintendo had an absolute shocker when it came to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. No, it&#39;s not adding <em>Super Mario Sunshine </em>to the Gamecube app just yet. The company is <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html">bringing Virtual Boy games to the service</a>, which is more bananas than anything you&#39;ll find in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To play those games from a system that was notoriously undercooked (partly because Nintendo was placing much more focus on the massively more successful Nintendo 64 around that time), you&#39;ll need an accessory. A $100 plastic tabletop one that looks just like the original Virtual Boy and a $25 cardboard version are on the way. They&#39;re compatible with the Nintendo Switch, Switch 2 and, if it&#39;s an authentic Virtual Boy experience, probably some eye strain.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-metroid-virtual-boy-and-more-all-the-biggest-announcements-from-todays-nintendo-direct-165722897.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s official. The Switch 2 is getting the next entry in the long-running Fire Emblem series. <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#39;s Weave</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6eNaiftiWE&amp;t=2s"><ins>will be available sometime in 2026</ins></a>, though we have nothing more specific than that.</p>
<p>We do have a trailer and it looks gorgeous. It showed off the game&#39;s tactical combat, which is a mainstay for the franchise, and teased the story. It involves some sort of gladiator-like contest called the Heroic Games. There are plenty of new combat units and many of them boast gladiatorial flair of some kind.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1c93a23ddafe4995b5003c02302c6842"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE?si=Qkhi7B3kws5mYMDn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It also looks to take place in the same universe as the immensely popular <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>, which came out for the original Switch console. There are some visual similarities and one character seems to be a grown-up version of someone from <em>Three Houses</em>.</p>
<p>This makes a certain kind of sense, given that <em>Three Houses</em> is the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Emblem"><ins>most financially successful game</ins></a> in franchise history and considered by critics to be a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-12-fire-emblem-three-houses-preview-nintendo-switch.html"><ins>stone-cold classic</ins></a>. The more recent <em>Fire Emblem: Engage</em> wasn&#39;t nearly as popular, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/i-played-fire-emblem-engage-on-easy-mode-and-it-got-me-back-into-gaming-120010358.html"><ins>despite being a solid entry</ins></a>.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, this series is all about tactical turn-based combat, factional rivalries and robust storylines involving numerous characters. It was a niche franchise here in the USA until the 3DS era and the release of <em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em> and <em>Fire Emblem: Fates</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-comes-out-for-the-switch-2-in-2026-162127483.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Amazon and Google misled advertisers regarding the pricing and terms for their ads. As first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/amazon-google-probed-by-ftc-over-search-advertising-practices"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the investigation is being conducted by the agency&#39;s consumer protection unit, and centers around the auction-style sale of advertising space by the companies.</p>
<p>Google sells ads using automated auctions that run after a user enters a search query. These auctions take place in less than a second. Amazon uses real-time auctions to place ads within its listings, which users would recognize as &quot;sponsored listings&quot; or &quot;sponsored ads&quot; when searching for specific products.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The investigation questions whether Amazon disclosed so-called &quot;reserve pricing&quot; for some of its ads, which is a price floor that advertisers must meet before they can buy an ad. For Google&#39;s part, the FTC is looking at certain practices by the search giant including its internal pricing process and whether it was surreptitiously increasing the cost of ads in ways that advertisers weren&#39;t privy to.</p>
<p>The FTC isn&#39;t the only federal agency keeping a close eye on big tech. Earlier this year, a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopoly-in-online-ad-tech-federal-judge-rules-151531919.html"><ins>federal judge ruled</ins></a> that Google held a monopoly in online ad tech after the Department of Justice (DOJ) sued to break up the giant&#39;s ad business. Google also recently escaped <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-doesnt-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-in-monopoly-case-rules-211032326.html"><ins>mostly unscathed</ins></a> from a Department of Justice monopoly case involving its Chrome browser.</p>
<p>FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson has previously said that big tech is one of the agency&#39;s top priorities. These investigations move forward against a backdrop of top tech CEOs continuing to try to curry favor with President Trump via <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/737757/apple-president-donald-trump-ceo-tim-cook-glass-corning"><ins>lavish personal gifts</ins></a> and sweeping (if potentially unrealistic) <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/zuckerberg-caught-on-hot-mic-telling-trump-i-wasnt-sure-how-much-to-promise-to-spend-on-ai-in-the-us-211915608.html"><ins>promises of investment</ins></a> in the US economy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-investigating-ad-sale-practices-at-google-and-amazon-160236895.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Adz7SlvT4"><ins>comes out for the Switch 2</ins></a> on January 22, 2026, which was revealed at today&#39;s lengthy <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-hour-long-nintendo-direct-is-set-for-september-12-135935134.html"><ins>Nintendo Direct livestream</ins></a>. This is the first entry in the remake trilogy and primarily takes place in the opening city of Midgar. You&#39;ll have to wait until <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> to explore the overworld map, and there&#39;s no Switch 2 release date for that one yet.</p>
<p>This release does include the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-intergrade-intermission-review-130017993.html"><em><ins>Episode Intermission</ins></em><ins> DLC</ins></a>, which involves the ninja Yuffie on a mission to steal powerful items from the evil Shinra corporation. That story takes place after the main campaign.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a trailer and it looks gorgeous, so the Switch 2 should be able to handle this one. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> originally <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-ps5-june-224834552.html"><ins>came out back in 2021</ins></a>. The long-awaited title was more of a reimagining than a straight remake of the iconic JRPG. The game still managed to garner critical acclaim, despite drastic changes from the original.</p>
<p>It was followed by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-a-whole-new-world-140018063.html"><em><ins>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</ins></em><ins> in 2024</ins></a>, with a third game on the way to close out the trilogy. There&#39;s no name for this final entry and we don&#39;t have a release date, as it&#39;s still in active development.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-hits-the-switch-2-on-january-22-152559995.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">A square camera sensor may sound like one of those things only nerds would appreciate, but as part of the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17s-new-selfie-camera-lets-you-take-group-shots-without-rotating-your-phone-195345475.html">new front-facing 18-megapixel &quot;Center Stage&quot; camera</a> <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">on the iPhone 17 lineup, it could have massive implications for Apple&#39;s users. They&#39;ll no longer need to turn their phones to take a landscape selfie, especially if they need to fit a large group of people, as that&#39;s all handled automatically by Center Stage. It&#39;s the sort of &quot;Why didn&#39;t I think of that?&quot; feature that other phone makers will likely copy, simply because it&#39;s immensely practical. Those square camera sensors could help make Apple a selfie pioneer, once again.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">We&#39;ve come a long way from when the iPhone 4 and HTC Evo 4G introduced the idea of modern front-facing cameras in 2010. Earlier cellphones in Japan and Europe had low quality selfie cameras, and you could argue that the Game Boy Camera also toyed with the idea when it arrived in 1998. But in 2010, we finally had powerful phones on relatively speedy mobile connections that could easily share photos and let users hop on video chats on a whim. (It still stings that it took Apple two more years to release the LTE-capable iPhone 5, which made FaceTime much more useful.)</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/iphone-air-island2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/iphone-air-island2.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="iPhone Air selfie camera" data-uuid="28b70967-cd9d-4f7f-95f3-5ed40acc97b8"><figcaption>iPhone Air selfie camera</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">During the iPhone 17 launch event, Apple revealed that its customers took 500 billion selfies last year, a massive figure that shows just how normalized the practice has become. Selfies were often mocked when they were deemed the purview of Instagram-obsessed teenage girls, but these days it&#39;s not unusual to see everyone from seniors to a gaggle of sports bros gathering around a single phone like an object of worship. And, on a personal note, they&#39;re really the only way to get decent photos of your entire family, especially when you&#39;re juggling two rambunctious young kids.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">We take photos to preserve memories, but selfies feel distinctive for their intimacy. You&#39;re not just capturing where you were, but you&#39;re also documenting yourself in the moment, along with the people around you. By making it easier to take selfies, it follows that you&#39;ll start to take even more of them, ultimately tying yourself into Apple&#39;s ecosystem even further. That leads to needing an iPhone with more storage and potentially more iCloud backup space down the line. You&#39;re also not going to jump over to an Android phone if you have to turn your phone sideways for a landscape selfie, or if you lose access to all of the cherished memories in your Apple Photos library.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The square camera sensor keeps you loyal.&nbsp;</span></p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIY7LZ7rFbs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It&#39;ll also change the way iPhone users take front-facing videos. Center Stage automatically keeps you in the center of FaceTime calls, so you don&#39;t have to worry so much about framing yourself up. And while I haven&#39;t seen this particular feature in action, it should also help alleviate the headache of turning your phone during a FaceTime call to match the recipient&#39;s device. (Or maybe I&#39;m just tired of telling my parents to flip their phones when their FaceTime chats have huge black borders.)</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">This may be a stretch, but I could see the Center Stage front camera making it more common to record video with your front and rear cameras at the same time. While it’s new to iPhone as “Dual Capture,” we’ve seen variants of it from Samsung and </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-16-nokia-8-hands-on.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALr96R_xtfTOqLN4T-q0BnicMn6xlyv7nnfj3_svHK8dUOTtSU8pblckDwVzBA4F7_s7amLAqCbaVv-ZsGDBExxRf_n1vdWcKb8XswepJuiUKYR0xNQxK1hBrOsE3JKB4hcTnLkaismGyG2zFl_ZdB-KE2wg9NgYIaNSMhDOddaV"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Nokia (remember #bothie?)</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> Android devices, but they’ve never really taken off. TikTok’s dual-camera live streaming mode has been more successful, and there are also vlogging apps like MixCam built around dual recording.&nbsp;With Dual Capture on iPhone 17, Center Stage’s ability to keep you in the middle of the action with the front camera should let you focus more on getting the best shot with the rear lenses.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;">While I’d love to see Apple cram more pixels into the 18MP Center Stage camera, moving to a square sensor will honestly be more impactful for all of the reasons above. It’s easy to throw in a higher resolution sensor, it’s tougher to fundamentally rethink how you can improve upon something as simple as taking a selfie.</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYbH5_QP8ng?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p style="text-align:left;"><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-square-selfie-camera-is-a-bigger-deal-than-you-think-151517041.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In one of the most unexpected announcements of today&#39;s Nintendo Direct, Game Freak <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250912294818/en/New-Nintendo-Direct-Kicks-off-the-Super-Mario-Bros.-40th-Anniversary-and-Brings-Slate-of-New-Announcements">revealed <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a>, a game that is clearly inspired by the Animal Crossing series. When <em>Pokopia</em> is released sometime next year, you&#39;ll assume the role of a Ditto determined to make a comfortable home for their friends. This Ditto has assumed the form of a human, and as they meet new Pokémon, they&#39;ll learn abilities they can use to transform their community. In turn, this work will lead to more Pokémon coming to live in your home. The game features a beautiful tilt-shift art style that is reminiscent of Pokémon&#39;s third generation of games that debuted on the Game Boy Advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo had a truly wild surprise up its sleeve for Switch Online + Expansion Pack <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-hour-long-nintendo-direct-is-set-for-september-12-135935134.html">during its Direct event on Friday</a>. The company is bringing back the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-21-nintendo-virtual-boy-review.html">Virtual Boy</a> as a physical device into which you can slot your Switch or Switch 2. A $100 plastic replica of the mid-90s tabletop system will soon be available for Switch Online members to buy. The company will sell a $25 cardboard version of the accessory too. No need to rub your eyes in disbelief (but if history is any indication, you might have to for relief after using this thing).</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need either accessory — which Nintendo says will only be available in the US and Canada — to play Virtual Boy games. They&#39;ll start hitting Switch Online + Expansion Pack on February 17. <em>Mario&#39;s Tennis </em>(a pack-in game for the original system)<em>, Galactic Pinball, Teleroboxer, Space Invaders </em>and <em>Tetris </em>are among the 14 stereoscopic 3D Virtual Boy games that Nintendo will bring to the subscription service over time.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That means most of the Virtual Boy games that were ever released are coming to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Nintendo only released 22 of them, since the Virtual Boy never took off. The company ended production of the device and stopped making games for it in 1996, only a year after the Virtual Boy hit shelves. Here&#39;s hoping the latest version of the accessory doesn&#39;t give players too many headaches.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendos-latest-3d-platformer-is-an-instant-classic-143048108.html">probably my favorite game of the year</a>, is getting a paid expansion today called <em>DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush.</em> As the title implies, you&#39;ll get to explore the island where Donkey Kong hails from and visit a whole host of his friends while you&#39;re at it. Naturally, there is more to explore and find there, but there&#39;s also a whole new set of challenges once you&#39;ve finished the main game story. That&#39;s the titular Emerald Rush.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timed missions involve you running around the island smashing as much green ore as you can get. As you go, smashing fossils you find unlocks various perks, which in turn help you amass more emeralds. Some of those perks act as multipliers on how much emerald you collect; others do things like make more treasure chests (that are naturally loaded with emeralds) appear. In somewhat roguelike fashion, your perks and skill reset after every run — but the location of things like fossils and Banandium Gems stay the same. So as you learn the levels, you&#39;ll be able to further maximize your collection.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Emerald Rush mode isn&#39;t limited to the new DK Island layer, either — it&#39;ll be integrated into other layers in the main game. As with everything else in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, it looks like a pretty delightful time. The DLC is set to go live today, but it&#39;s not up in the Nintendo eShop yet so its price remains a mystery.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t played the main game yet, Nintendo also released a demo that you can try later today, as well.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Supergiant has a thing for dropping its biggest Hades news at Nintendo Directs. Five years after <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-nintendo-switch-release-date-173000721.html">launching the first game during a Nintendo stream</a>, the developer struck again. The 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> is coming on September 25, for Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Hades II</em> isn&#39;t exactly new to PC players. It&#39;s been in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-ii-is-now-available-in-early-access-on-pc-170527415.html">early access there for 16 months</a>. Despite being a pre-release version, it has over 63,000 Steam <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/#app_reviews_hash">reviews</a>. Its reception averages &quot;very positive&quot; (and &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; for those written in English). The 1.0 edition promises not only the game&#39;s console debut but its true ending.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Only the Switch versions were covered in the Nintendo Direct (duh). But we already knew the PC and Mac editions were <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/hades-ii-will-launch-on-switch-2-and-switch-before-playstation-and-xbox-163757321.html">launching simultaneously with them</a>. So, expect its Steam and Epic listings to be updated in short order. Like <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-2020-163051873.html">the original game</a>, <em>Hades II</em> is likely a timed console exclusive. So, while it isn&#39;t yet official, you can expect PlayStation and Xbox versions sometime down the road.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-coming-sep25/">According to Supergiant</a>, Hades II will support 120 fps when the Switch 2 is in TV mode. That drops to 60 fps for Switch 2 in 1080p, while the original Switch can handle that same refresh rate at only 720p. Both Switch version will cross-save with the Steam and Epic versions as well.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="72fd4351ac834b9f96315d39425bf2d3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jEE4rBEzKM4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>

<p>The <em>Hades</em> sequel shifts the focus from Zagreus to his sister, Melinoë, princess of the underworld. She&#39;s up against Chronos: the Titan of Time, father of Hades and bona fide asshole. Supergiant says the roguelike runs at a smooth 60 fps on the Switch 2.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is coming on December 4 to both the original Switch and the recently-released Switch 2, as announced during today&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/an-hour-long-nintendo-direct-is-set-for-september-12-135935134.html">Nintendo Direct livestream</a>. The Switch 2 is getting a dedicated version with upscaled graphics and some other bells and whistles, just like the upcoming <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>.</p>
<p>We already knew the next Metroid would drop <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-lands-on-switch-in-2025-145927227.html">sometime in 2025</a>, but it&#39;s nice to have an actual release date. We got a nifty trailer for the first-person adventure <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-samus-new-psychic-abilities-143326681.html">earlier this year</a> that showed off new power-ups for protagonist Samus Aran. The game looks very fun and certainly seems to capture the spirit of its predecessors.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="706628d82ce64d63ae37957f8584fa3b"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJNCNswbdG0?si=ruuE3_0Rb8CnLvfq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>The plot involves Samus exploring a large planet and battling malevolent alien creatures which more than likely include the titular Metroids. This is a first-person game, unlike the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-hands-on-130040843.html">relatively recent <em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, with an emphasis on scanning the environment, shooting enemies and solving puzzles. She has a cool-looking motorbike this time around, with an Amiibo figure to match. The trailer also shows off some wide-open sections to explore.</p>
<p>The first <em>Metroid Prime </em>was released all the way back in 2002 for the Nintendo Gamecube. The fourth entry has experienced a rocky development cycle, with Nintendo <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-retro-studios.html">scrapping the project entirely</a> in 2019 to start over from scratch.</p>
<p>The Metroid series dates back to 1986 with the NES original. The franchise represents one half of the popular Metroidvania genre, which is buzzy right now thanks to the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silksong-smacking-sticks-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110020156.html">release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>. A price has not yet been announced.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-will-be-released-on-december-4-for-switch-1-and-2-134718933.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">Switch 2</a> fans have a new Mario Tennis game to look forward to early next year. During Friday&#39;s Direct presentation, Nintendo <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250912294818/en/New-Nintendo-Direct-Kicks-off-the-Super-Mario-Bros.-40th-Anniversary-and-Brings-Slate-of-New-Announcements"><em>announced Mario Tennis Fever</em></a>. It&#39;s the first new entry in the long-running series since the release of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-nintendo-switch-mario-tennis-aces-preview.html"><em>Mario Tennis Aces</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>in 2018. The new game will be a Switch 2 exclusive, with Nintendo promising plenty of tweaks to an established formula. For one, there are new defensive moves your character can take, including slides and dives, to prevent your opponent from scoring a point.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="cee542f5935046bf97a230718362016b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myC8ZlDiulo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Then there are the fever rackets, from which the game is named after. These essentially allow you to snowball against your opponent by building a rally gauge and then executing a &quot;fever shot.&quot; The effect of these depend on the racket you have equipped. For example, the ice racket will freeze a part of the court, while the mini mushroom racket will shrink your opponents, making it harder for them to cover their side of the court, if they&#39;re hit by its projectiles. There are 30 fever rackets to try. <em>Mario Tennis</em> <em>Fever</em> will also offer the biggest roster in series history. In all, there are 38 playable characters, including fan-favorites like Rosalina and Donkey Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, Fever looks to offer plenty of different ways to play, with online play offered alongside a silly story mode that sees Mario and his friends turned into babies and forced to relearn the rules of tennis. There&#39;s even a swing mode where you can use the Joy-Cons motion controls for a &quot;more authentic experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won&#39;t have to wait long to play <em>Mario Tennis Fever, </em>with the game set to release on February 12, 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-tennis-fever-hits-the-court-on-february-12-134227490.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo is dropping a slew of Mario-related announcements this morning as part of the franchise&#39;s 40th anniversary, including a new game starring his dinosaur companion. <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> is coming out for Switch 2 in the Spring of 2026 and the brief bit of gameplay we saw plants it squarely in the cutesy yet intriguing tradition of past Yoshi platformers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game&#39;s worlds and levels appear to be part of a book named Mr. Encyclopedia (or Mr. E for short) that Yoshi can jump into and explore. The game&#39;s main hook is traveling through those worlds and documenting the creatures you meet along the way, whose special abilities are what let you progress. For example, there&#39;s a little yellow walking flower that feels quite familiar from past Yoshi games; finding it and letting it ride on Yoshi makes other flowers bloom in the level. Presumably, that&#39;s a component to getting to where you need to go. In another level, dandelions that you can scatter will make rocks brittle so you can pound them and proceed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with most Yoshi games, there&#39;s a cute and distinctive art style on display here — the gameplay will be recognizable to anyone who has played games going all the way back to <em>Yoshi&#39;s Island</em> on the SNES, but obviously with more modern tweaks. It&#39;s not the same aesthetic as the yarn- and craft-based things we&#39;ve seen on games like <em>Yoshi&#39;s Crafted World </em>and <em>Yoshi&#39;s Wooly World</em> (which introduced the absolutely adorable yarn-based Yoshi) but it&#39;s in the ballpark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While <em>Yoshi</em> <em>and the Mysterious World</em> continues the kid-friendly aesthetics of those earlier games, I&#39;m hoping it brings some of the challenge found in old-school titles like <em>Yoshi&#39;s Island</em>. We&#39;ll find out next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-is-a-new-platformer-coming-to-the-switch-2-next-spring-133805615.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>We&#39;ve known this movie was <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/were-officially-getting-a-second-super-mario-bros-movie-in-2026-152430999.html">coming for a while now</a>, and even had an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-next-mario-movie-may-share-its-name-with-an-snes-classic-141146941.html">approximate release date</a>.
