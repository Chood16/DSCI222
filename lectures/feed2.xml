<p>Much like we do for our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html#how-we-test-tablets">best tablets overall</a>, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Geekbench+6&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nZWVrYmVuY2gtNi9pZDE1NjU3Mjg4OTUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvZ2Vla2JlbmNoLTYvaWQxNTY1NzI4ODk1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXLw1CqK2-DJCUdZ10z8y3y5zoaT1DIRM0hVETVdaXCR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgeekbench-6%2Fid1565728895" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geekbench-6/id1565728895">Geekbench 6</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=3DMark&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC8zZG1hcmsvaWQxNTEyMzcyMjkzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvYXBwLzNkbWFyay9pZDE1MTIzNzIyOTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUlFo5xbxpX14gaLPTNphOWPyRGmEcb45197gjO2djrT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2F3dmark%2Fid1512372293" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3dmark/id1512372293">3DMark</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=GFXBench+Metal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nZnhiZW5jaC1tZXRhbC9pZDk4OTA4MDkwMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiM2E4MTgtNjZiMy00NmJmLTk4ZTMtMTY2MzlhZDg2OThhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nZnhiZW5jaC1tZXRhbC9pZDk4OTA4MDkwMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAesW5iaopzqBQpoqZbGWmdYhSuM8pSGLxJSrwaFqxW3W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgfxbench-metal%2Fid989080902" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gfxbench-metal/id989080902">GFXBench Metal</a>, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>To help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-new-features-coming-to-ipados-26">What are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?</h3> 
<p>Apple released the latest update to its iPad operating system, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html">iPadOS 26</a>, in September. The update is a fairly significant overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-bringing-preview-to-ipados-175643371.html">Preview app</a>; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It also uses the new “<a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">liquid glass</a>” design language that Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025.</p> 
<p>That said, it completely removed the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ie/102576">“slide over” and “split view”</a> modes found in previous versions of iPadOS, which can make quickly viewing multiple apps at once a little more cumbersome. (Though the former <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apple-is-bringing-back-slide-over-in-ipados-261-190036025.html">will now return</a> in an upcoming update.) Notably, most of these features are available across Apple’s tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/os/ipados/">Apple’s overview page</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-ipads-typically-last">How long do iPads typically last?</h3> 
<p>If history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/ipad/ipad213a25b2/ipados">iPadOS 26 update</a>, for example, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://endoflife.date/ipad">is available</a> on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html">iPad case</a>.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-the-ipad-and-the-ipad-air">What’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?</h3> 
<p>Compared to the standard iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance prospects, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. Its display supports a wider <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3">P3</a> color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html">faster Wi-Fi 6E</a>, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.</p> 
<p>Starting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-79-apple-pencil-has-a-usb-c-charging-port-141732710.html">USB-C</a> Apple Pencils – which are <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html">more convoluted</a> to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Magic+Keyboard+Folio&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9zZWxlY3QtaXBhZC1rZXlib2FyZHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3Avc2VsZWN0LWlwYWQta2V5Ym9hcmRzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaXdYRY-ix39wbG7s9mrj2Kn0AUJuI_i_EC3onSQrOH2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-ipad-keyboards" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9zZWxlY3QtaXBhZC1rZXlib2FyZHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYr6D5fyvVZGUJfJ0ZmRXcoXzdAGDilzRWqO1gH7O44u&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-ipad-keyboards&amp;uuid=DiDrMtUfvQdnYxtx38705">Magic Keyboard Folio</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-ipads-and-android-tablets">What’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets?</h3> 
<p>The operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/battle-of-the-dirt-cheap-tablets-amazon-fire-hd-8-vs-walmart-onn-8-130031544.html">see an $80 iPad</a> anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS (though the former <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/android-is-making-it-more-difficult-to-sideload-apps">may no longer be an option</a> in the coming months). Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.</p> 
<p>But we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-an-ipad-replace-a-laptop">Can an iPad replace a laptop?</h3> 
<p>This is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html">iPad accessories</a>. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.</p> 
<p>Broadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. The recent iPadOS 26 update does close the gap a bit, though it’s still not quite as fluid. Safari on the iPad isn’t fully on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-take-a-screenshot-on-an-ipad">How do I take a screenshot on an iPad?</h3> 
<p>As we note in our <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device-163053556.html">screenshot how-to guide</a>, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we&#39;ve seen with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-2023-prius-prime-plug-in-hybrid-162057073.html">Toyota&#39;s Prius Prime</a>, putting a solar panel on a car&#39;s roof is a nifty idea but can only gain you a few free miles a day due to the limited size. With a new prototype of its hyper-popular Sakura &quot;kei&quot; EV, Nissan has the answer: a bigger solar panel roof called the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-4490cf5fc2161a51d431ba720301391e">AO-Solar Extender</a>. When fully stretched out on a sunny day, it can add about 1,864 miles of driving distance a year and power multiple accessories.</p>
<p>The panel works whether you&#39;re driving or parked. When extended (in &quot;solar pompadour&quot; mode as my colleague put it), it generates 500 watts on sunny days. At the same time, it helps block sunlight from the windshield, &quot;reducing cabin temperature and lowering the need for air conditioning power consumption,&quot; Nissan noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/be4c0a10-b097-11f0-bfd6-66ab36382b98" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/be4c0a10-b097-11f0-bfd6-66ab36382b98" style="height:1573px;width:2800px;" alt="Nissan made a nifty solar panel system for its Sakura EV" data-uuid="384b6285-df78-327f-af42-18c17834d8b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NISSAN DESIGN</div></figure>
<p>When retracted in driving mode, it still pumps out 300 watts in the sun (80 watts in the rain), quite a bit more than the 185 watts max generated by the Prius Prime&#39;s solar roof. And if you&#39;re worried about aerodynamics, Nissan said the roof is designed to minimize drag and integrate well with the Sakura&#39;s design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just a fun exercise, as Nissan said it&#39;s planning to launch the AO-Solar Extender commercially, with details to follow at a later date. It could be a useful accessory on the Sakura, which has been Japan&#39;s most popular EV since 2022 thanks to its &quot;sufficient&quot; range, cute kei looks and spacious interior. The automaker will show it off at the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.japan-mobility-show.com/en/">Japan Mobility Show</a> starting on October 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nissan-made-a-nifty-solar-panel-system-for-its-sakura-ev-061235566.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-private-internet-access"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=Private+Internet+Access&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb2xZhJgbuYJ1Fdt6xW-K50AZouRlBZmdjdZsNQwkI8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h3> 
<p>Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.</p> 
<p>PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html">PIA VPN review</a>.</p> 
<p>The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla's speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vpn-faqs">VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. There are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, so always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google's One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electronic Arts <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has announced</a> a new partnership with Stability AI, the creator of AI image generation tool <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/stable-diffusion-35-follows-your-prompts-more-closely-and-generates-more-diverse-people-184022965.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Stable Diffusion</a>. The company will &quot;co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows&quot; for the game developer, with the hopes of speeding up development while maintaining quality.</p><p>&quot;I use the term smarter paintbrushes,” Steve Kestell, Head of Technical Art for EA SPORTS said in the announcement. &quot;We are giving our creatives the tools to express what they want.&quot; To start, the &quot;smarter paintbrushes&quot; EA and Stability AI are building are concentrated on generating textures and in-game assets. EA hopes to create &quot;Physically Based Rendering materials&quot; with new tools &quot;that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company also describes using AI to &quot;pre-visualize entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation of game content.&quot; Stability AI is most famous for its powerful Stable Diffusion image generator, but the company maintains multiple tools for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://stability.ai/stable-3d" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">generating 3D models</a>, too, so the partnership is by no means out of place.</p><p>It helps that AI is on the tip of most video game executives&#39; tongues. Strauss Zelnick, the head of Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two,<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-ceo-predicts-genai-will-create-jobs-not-kill-them" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"> recently shared</a> that generative AI &quot;will not reduce employment, it will increase employment,&quot; because &quot;technology always increases productivity, which in turn increases GDP, which in turn increases employment.&quot; Krafton, the publisher of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, made its commitment to AI even more clear, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">announcing plans</a> on Thursday to become an AI-first company. Companies with a direct stake in the success of the AI industry, like Microsoft, have also created <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-windows-pcs-and-the-xbox-mobile-app-185452965.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">gaming-focused tools</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-trained-an-ai-model-on-a-game-no-one-played-160038242.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">developed models</a> for prototyping. </p><p>The motivations for EA might be even simpler, though. The company is in the midst of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">being taken private</a>, and will soon be saddled with billions in debt. Theoretically cutting costs with AI might be one way the company hopes to survive the transition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-partners-with-the-company-behind-stable-diffusion-to-make-games-with-ai-222253069.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Confession time: I’ve had the <em>Sleep Awake</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Steam page</a> open in a tab for about a month (hey, we all organize our thoughts in unique and beautiful ways), just so I don’t forget about it. The past year has been stacked with fabulous original games across a wide range of genres, including horror, and this is one I didn’t want to miss. Now, I can close the tab and  put a firm release date on the calendar, as <em>Sleep Awake</em> is officially due to hit PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 2. Happy holidays, indeed.</p><p><em>Sleep Awake </em>is a first-person, narrative-heavy, psychedelic horror game set in the last known city on an Earth that’s been ravaged by The HUSH, a mysterious force that disappears anyone who falls asleep. Katja must stay alert and survive the city as its citizens experiment on themselves in increasingly extreme ways, attempting to achieve permanent wakefulness and outmaneuver The HUSH. Needless to say, things get weird.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1GrdtdSPh0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Sleep Awake</em> comes from Eyes Out, the studio founded by <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, and it’s published by Blumhouse Games. Finck is responsible for the trippy audio stylings of <em>Sleep Awake</em>, of course. This is the studio’s debut title and something they’ve been working on for four years. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Back in 2021</a>, Davis and Finck told Engadget they were focused on building an ultra-immersive, audio-driven horror experience with a nightmarish bent.</p><p>“The type of horror that we&#39;re building has a lot to do with the horrors of the universe and the horrors that you kind of go to sleep with at night, the ones that are just around the corner and outside of our purview, but exist,” Davis said. “And the technology for building those types of soundscapes, the localized audio and reverb and the realism behind that, coming from VR before, I had a lot of opportunity to work with that stuff.”</p><p>Finck added the following: “I&#39;m really excited about the nuance and the subtlety of coming from silence, like a really impactful silence, and beginning to emerge from that silence towards an impactful embellishment of some sort, however great or greater. And that play between the diegetic soundscape of the world within the tangible, physical space inside the game, and where it blurs with the score, the music of the game, can be really challenging and inspiring.”</p><p>Blumhouse Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-fear-the-spotlight-became-blumhouses-first-video-game-140044877.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">published its first horror project</a>, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, in October 2024 and on top of <em>Sleep Awake</em>, it has a steady stream of additional terrors in store.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple will owe money to UK users after losing an App Store antitrust lawsuit there on Thursday, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/37a5c1e4-4433-4b56-b47f-f80fcd3d52b8"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. The Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the iPhone maker abused its dominant market position to inflate developer fees.</p>
<p>The tribunal found that the company has &quot;near absolute market power&quot; for iOS app distribution and in-app payments. The decision declared that Apple has been &quot;abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices.&quot; <em>FT</em> reports that Apple will appeal the decision.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The class action claimants said damages of about £1.5bn would be split between 36 million consumers. A subsequent hearing to determine the process for &quot;resolving any questions relating to the calculation&quot; of damages could come as soon as next month.</p>
<p>Apple has an increasingly strained relationship with the tighter regulations across the Atlantic. Earlier this week, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-steps-up-its-attacks-on-europes-dma-regulations-175332390.html">stepped up its attacks</a> on the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">protect consumers from Big Tech dominance</a>. And on Wednesday, the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-confirms-apple-and-google-have-strategic-market-status-in-mobile-platforms">confirmed</a> that Apple has &quot;strategic market status&quot; in <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-passes-its-version-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-175642166.html">the country&#39;s equivalent</a> of the DMA. That gives the CMA authority to &quot;ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple provided the following statement in response to the ruling:</p>
<p><em>&quot;We thank the tribunal for its consideration but strongly disagree with this ruling, which takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy. The App Store has benefited businesses and consumers across the U.K., creating a dynamic marketplace where developers compete and users can choose from millions of innovative apps. This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments. The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections — giving developers and consumers many options in how they build, share, and download apps. We intend to appeal.&quot;</em></p>

Nike says the first-generation model consists of a running shoe with a carbon fiber plate, a calf-mounted rechargeable battery, a motor and a drive belt. While it has the neon colors and cushioned finish of a normal pair of running shoes, the basic design of Project Amplify seems like a more polished version of the robotic Sidekick shoes Dephy is already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.dephy.com/about" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">pitching on its website</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Amplify doesn&#39;t replace your legs&#39; ability to walk or run, but rather makes going further and faster easier. Nike compares the experience to an e-bike, which typically don&#39;t eliminate the need for pedaling, and instead augment your pedals with power from an electric motor. Nike says Project Amplify &quot;makes walking or running uphill feel like moving on flat ground,&quot; and in the case of some people who tested it, turned a 12-minute mile into a 10-minute mile. Dephy and the Nike Sport Research Lab (NSRL) worked with more than 400 different athletes to test various versions of robotic shoes, covering &quot;over 2.4 million steps, the equivalent of roughly 12,000 laps around the NSRL’s 200-meter track.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The companies&#39; approach, melding an existing fashion brand with robotics, is similar to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://squamish.arcteryxacademy.com/mo/go" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Arc&#39;teryx&#39;s MO/GO pants</a> from 2024, robotic trousers developed in partnership with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.skipwithjoy.com/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Skip</a> that help hikers with balance and endurance. Project Amplify is smaller (and hopefully less expensive), but robot-assisted gadgets increasingly seem like a way robotics research could make its way into consumer products, beyond things like vacuums.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/nike-mind-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/nike-mind-1.jpg" style="height:2070px;width:3200px;" alt="The Nike Mind 001 mules and Nike Mind 002 sneakers on a white background." data-uuid="0acb3ea6-d34d-447d-a711-bf40c2b05169"><figcaption>The Nike Mind 001 mules and Nike Mind 002 sneakers on a white background.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nike</div></figure><p>Nike&#39;s Mind 001 and Mind 002 shoes are based on the company&#39;s neuroscience research, and are strange in a different way.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Strava&#39;s big attack on Garmin didn&#39;t last long. On Tuesday, the former filed paperwork to dismiss its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/strava-sues-garmin-in-bizarre-patent-infringement-lawsuit-213300227.html">patent infringement lawsuit</a> against the latter, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-drops-voluntarily-lawsuit-against.html"><em>DC Rainmaker</em></a>. The battle, which included a &quot;Setting the record straight&quot; Reddit post from Strava&#39;s chief product officer, lasted all of 21 days.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accused Garmin of infringing on patents related to heat maps and segments. Strava asked the court to halt all sales of infringing Garmin products, which, according to its characterization, would have been, well, most of them.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Strava Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar escalated the fight with an October 2 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin/">Reddit post</a>. He said his company&#39;s legal maneuver was in response to Garmin API guidelines that &quot;required the Garmin logo to be present on every single activity post, screen, graph, image, sharing card, etc.&quot; Salazar wrote that Garmin &quot;wants to use Strava and every other partner as an advertising platform — they told us they care more about their marketing than your user experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Those are fighting words, and Strava appeared to be digging in for a righteous and bitter battle against its partner. But now, it&#39;s essentially, &quot;Eh, never mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Why the quick reversal? We reached out to Strava for comment, and we&#39;ll update this post if we hear back. But closed-door discussions between the companies, possibly including threats from Garmin to counter-sue, seem likely. Garmin has a stacked patent library and a strong record defending them in court. Besides, <em>DC Rainmaker</em> says Strava&#39;s case (especially the parts related to heat map patents) didn&#39;t appear to hold much water in the first place.</p>
<p>Strava&#39;s initial move was all the more bizarre, considering how much its business model depends on activity data from Garmin devices. The two companies have a longstanding relationship, which you can imagine isn&#39;t so healthy at the moment. Losing access to Garmin&#39;s legion of devices could have been catastrophic to the San Francisco-based Strava, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/12/strava-eyes-ipo-as-gen-z-trades-dating-apps-for-running-clubs/">plans</a> to file an IPO next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/strava-pulls-the-plug-on-its-garmin-lawsuit-after-just-21-days-204255109.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know there are bigger fish to fry, but I wouldn&#39;t be doing my job if I didn&#39;t draw your attention to this travesty of a commercial Verizon just released. It&#39;s only 30 seconds long but may go down as one of the worst ads I&#39;ve ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What’s so offensive, you ask? Well, the carrier (and one-time parent company of Engadget) wants to promote the fact that it will give AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers a better deal on their wireless plan if they bring in their monthly cellular bill. That&#39;s all well and good, but we need to talk about the cathode-ray tube TV that&#39;s at the center of the commercial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The ad opens with a woman walking into a Best Buy-coded store and handing over a 27-inch CRT TV to a nearby sales associate. &quot;Hi, I got this old thing and the bill from the store where I got it,&quot; she tells the young salesperson while casually tossing the TV to him. &quot;Figured you could beat it with a better deal on one of these big boys,&quot; she adds, pointing to, let’s be honest, an <a>objectively worse flat panel TV</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I need to know: did anyone who worked on this commercial try to lift a CRT? Look, I know it&#39;s 2025, and even the newest sets are now close to two decades old, but even if you&#39;ve never seen one in real-life, surely you&#39;ve heard how heavy they are? If I had to guess, the TV we see in the commercial, which looks like an <a>RCA 27R411T</a>, weighs close to 75 pounds. There&#39;s a reason so many Facebook Marketplace listings recommend you bring a friend with you when you come pick up the CRT they&#39;re selling; most people can&#39;t lift even a mid-sized set on their own.&nbsp; </p><p>I hate to think how Verizon made this commercial. CRTs are a dead technology. No company is making new consumer sets anymore, and any working CRTs left out in the world are on borrowed time. If the company gutted a working set to make this commercial, it means there’s one less CRT in an ever-dwindling pool. Someone could have enjoyed that TV and stopped it from <a>entering a landfill</a>. </p><p>But as for the rest of the commercial, it’s equally as bad. No big box retailer is accepting trade-ins for a CRT TV, and even if they were, trying to get rid of one that way would be a rookie move. CRTs, both TVs and monitors, are highly sought after by retro gamers. Even a relatively unknown set like the 27R411T can catch a few hundred dollars, especially if it&#39;s in pristine condition. In fact, a quick <a>eBay search</a> returns a seller looking for $350 for their 27R411T unit.&nbsp;</p><p>But you know what our dear Verizon booster does? She just walks away without the CRT after the salesperson tells her the shop won&#39;t give her a better deal on a new TV. &quot;Guess you&#39;re not as cool as Verizon&quot; she says, uttering a thing no one in the history has ever said. Sorry, joke&#39;s on you, lady. Not only is that TV impossibly light, it&#39;s way cooler than anything Verizon has ever done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/verizons-latest-ad-defies-crt-physics-202441012.html?src=rss]]></description>

However. the company just upended that precedent with the M EV1, a 60MP mirrorless camera with a classic M design but an electronic viewfinder (EVF) in place of the rangefinder.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It may upset purists, but it's a move that makes sense from a sales point of view. Leica's old-school film cameras used its M mount lens system and, in order to keep the bodies compact, didn't have reflex mirrors like SLRs. Instead, they used an optical rangefinder, which provides a weird, offset and inaccurate view of the scene. Leica kept the rangefinders when it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-09-14-leica-m8-combines-old-world-charm-with-new-world-tech.html">launched its digital M </a>cameras, even though it could have switched to an EVF.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>In 2014, Leica <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-22-leica-t-hands-on.html">launched</a> a more modern mirrorless camera lineup with the new SL mount that did use electronic viewfinders. However, they have always <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-20-leica-sl.html">lacked</a> the cachet, compact size and gorgeous looks of the M-System, so don't appeal as much to well-heeled buyers that want the full Leica experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Enter the M EV1, which looks exactly like you want a Leica to look but boots the rangefinder in favor of an EVF. "Designed for both devoted Leica enthusiasts and those new to the M System, it makes capturing beautiful, intentional photographs easier than ever," the company wrote. Leica probably noticed buyers who <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilm-x100-vi-review-a-one-of-a-kind-camera-for-street-photography-and-travel-133004951.html">wanted a pretty camera</a> were drawn to the M series, but then put off by the wonky rangefinders.</p> 
<p>Handmade in Germany, the M EV1 is definitely beautiful, with the classic rounded rectangular M shape and a new diamond-patterned leatherette to give it a distinctive look compared to the rangefinder models. Leica also eliminated the dedicated ISO dial (the setting is now done via another control), which helped make it 1.62 ounces lighter than the M11-P. It has a new custom function lever that lets you activate focusing aids and digital zoom options while looking through the viewfinder.</p>

<p>That viewfinder is definitely a good one, with 5.76 million dots of resolution for a sharp view. The rear screen has a sharp 2.32-million-dot display, but is fixed in place and doesn't tilt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Otherwise, the M EV1 has similar specs to the M11-P. It has a high resolution 60MP sensor with support for 14-bit RAW images processed using Leica's excellent color science and burst speeds up to 4.5 fps. You can shoot with the mechanical shutter at up to 1/4000th and 1/16,000th in silent mode (flash sync is 1/180th). Focusing is strictly manual, with magnification and focus peaking assist functions. Naturally, it uses Leica's famous and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2aa8b5df-7e77-4da6-95a2-3a758302c13a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;linkText=tremendously+expensive&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2Mvc2VhcmNoP3E9TGVpY2ElMjBNJTIwbW91bnQlMjBsZW5zJmZpbHRlcnM9ZmN0X2JyYW5kX25hbWUlM0FsZWljYSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmFhOGI1ZGYtN2U3Ny00ZGE2LTk1YTItM2E3NTgzMDJjMTNhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2Mvc2VhcmNoP3E9TGVpY2ElMjBNJTIwbW91bnQlMjBsZW5zJmZpbHRlcnM9ZmN0X2JyYW5kX25hbWUlM0FsZWljYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZlyl7C_PNb8nZxcP3PISiLKttetyXZHeR85stm4GpaU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DLeica%2520M%2520mount%2520lens%26filters%3Dfct_brand_name%253Aleica" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=Leica%20M%20mount%20lens&amp;filters=fct_brand_name%3Aleica">tremendously expensive</a> compact M mount lenses.

<p>Though some features are old school, the M EV1 lets you connect to Leica's Fotos app via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or a cable for quick sharing on social media and elsewhere. It also supports Leica's <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/leicas-m11-p-is-a-disinformation-resistant-camera-built-for-wealthy-photojournalists-130032517.html">Content Credentials system</a> that enables the origin and history of an image to be clearly traced to avoid copyright theft or AI spoofing. Other features include 64GB of built-in storage along with UHS-II SD card support, and a meager 237 shots on a battery charge when using the EVF.</p>

After all, Apple just makes two models: the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. But the available variations within those categories — screen size, chip type, capacity and more — deserve some consideration. You also may wonder what the real-world differences are between models and who they’re best for. To make things even more interesting, Apple keeps announcing new chips. The latest, the M5 <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">came out October 15</a>, and is now found in the base model, 14-inch MacBook Pro (as well as the iPad Pro and the Vision Pro). This guide breaks down Apple’s terminology, as well as all which upgrades make the most sense so you can get the best MacBook for what you want to do.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-budget-macbooks">What about budget MacBooks?</h2> 
<p>Historically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Now, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&amp;H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.</p> 
<p>Of course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">decent PCs for under $500</a>.

<p>Compared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">M1</a> chip, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html">used Intel chips</a> in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-chips-pro-max-003004080.html">M3</a> generations followed that first chip and currently, MacBooks come equipped with M4 and M5-series chips.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air. The base-model 14-inch Pro now comes with either <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">the latest M5 chip</a>. Other Pro configurations have the M4 Max or the M4 Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-new-mac-studio-comes-with-the-long-awaited-m3-ultra-chip-140005216.html">M3 series</a> in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.</p> 
<p>While a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cpu-cores"><strong>CPU cores</strong></h3> 
<p>The lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. The base-model MacBook Pro uses the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="http://engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html">latest M5 chip</a>, but only on the 14-inch model. The upgraded versions of that laptop use the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips (which are a step up from their predecessors, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-report-reveals-details-on-the-three-m3-chips-apple-may-launch-monday-night-202456989.html">M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max</a> chips). The <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-unveils-its-top-of-the-line-m4-max-chip-150241987.html">M4 Max</a> is the burliest chip and built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-ram"><strong>RAM</strong></h3> 
<p>Your options for RAM (or unified memory) varies, but when Apple switched to the M4 chip for the MacBook Air, the lowest amount of RAM you can get was bumped to 16GB. That’s a necessary jump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-imac-gets-an-m4-refresh-for-faster-apple-intelligence-151251449.html">Apple Intelligence</a> (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM. The M5 chip in the base-model MacBook Pro comes with a minimum of 16GB and can be configured to a maximum of 32GB of RAM..</p> 
<p>You’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.</p> 
<p>In addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use.</p> 
<p>For a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-storage-capacity-ssd"><strong>Storage capacity (SSD)</strong></h3> 
<p>Storage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.</p> 
<p>When Apple announced the <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-first-impressions-lights-camera-action-button-200647981.html">iPhone 15</a>, the company also announced new iCloud+ <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/icloud-adds-new-6tb-and-12tb-storage-tiers-194853580.html">storage storage plans</a>, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-screen-size"><strong>Screen size</strong></h3> 
<p>The MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html">reviewed</a> the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen "makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.</p> 
<p>But screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.</p> 
<p>All MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (<a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html">in-plane switching</a>, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).</p> 
<p>You also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.</p> 
<p>Compared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-systems"><strong>Operating systems</strong></h3> 
<p>Software considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html">if you’re switching</a> from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/metal-4-for-macos-tahoe-26-introduces-new-gaming-features-like-frame-interpolation-183247623.html">better graphics</a> coming to Macs.</p> 
<p>As for macOS, it’s getting better too. With <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html">macOS Tahoe 26</a>, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design</a> for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price"><strong>Price</strong></h3> 
<p>When Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a6dcab25-0d73-4da2-98ba-8a4bd8cb864d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=AppleCare&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYXBwbGVjYXJlLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZkY2FiMjUtMGQ3My00ZGEyLTk4YmEtOGE0YmQ4Y2I4NjRkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYXBwbGVjYXJlLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW7l2Hiboe-Xov9ubl4eKAGiAjzsUFuZNqFF-ciyOuIQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapplecare%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/applecare/">AppleCare</a> is another cost to consider.

If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14-inch M5 or 16-inch M4 MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage and 32GB of RAM to make your machine as future-proof as possible.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Game Developers Conference (GDC) is undergoing a major overhaul, according to a report <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-lowers-ticket-prices-streamlines-pass-types-in-festival-of-gaming-reimagination-">by the affiliated publication <em>Game Developer</em></a>. The &quot;reimagined&quot; conference is getting a name change, as it&#39;ll now be called the GDC Festival of Gaming. It&#39;s also changing up how passes work and transitioning the shift of its focus to &quot;meet today&#39;s broader, interconnected games industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the new simplified pass structure. The newly-announced Festival Pass replaces the pre-existing All-Access pass and costs 45 percent less than its predecessor. Pricing starts at $649 and offers access to all of the event&#39;s main content programming. Access to the main conference was previously segmented depending on a number of pass types.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="83eadafc0d0e48df82c29342a3cdd9ba"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 THE WAIT IS OFFICIALLY OVER! 🚨<br>Registration for the 2026 GDC Festival of Gaming is NOW LIVE!<br>Calling ALL game changers - devs, creators, publishers, investors, marketers &amp; everyone in between!<br>🎮 Experience the NEW GDC: <br>🚀 Next-level networking <br>💼 Career-boosting sessions &amp;… <a href="https://t.co/tH70wYwHoV">pic.twitter.com/tH70wYwHoV</a></p>— Game Developers Conference (@Official_GDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/Official_GDC/status/1981390546217120087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>There are two other main pass types. The Digital Pass offers access to online-only networking and costs $799. The Game Changer Pass is the baddest of the bunch, offering all of the above plus access to a facilitated meetings program. This invite-only program promises meetings with industry icons and access to a series of talks called the Luminaries Speaker Series. That one costs $1,700. Indies, start-ups and academics can apply for discounts that can knock another $200 to $300 off the price tag.</p>
<p>As for content, the organization seems to be placing a heavier focus on networking. Organizers say the event wants to serve the industry &quot;across every state of a game&#39;s life cycle&quot; and that all changes were &quot;informed and inspired by feedback from the community.&quot;</p>
<p>The Expo Hall has been redesigned and renamed Festival Hall and will prioritize offering developers opportunities to connect with one another through game demos and social spaces. GDC president Nina Brown described the new event as &quot;celebrating the vital interconnection between creators, leaders and partners that drive the industry forward.&quot;</p>
<p>GDC starts next year in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MKNhYUyU9uk">San Francisco on March 9</a>. It goes until March 13 and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://gdconf.com/">passes are available now</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gdc-is-lowering-ticket-prices-and-overhauling-many-aspects-of-the-conference-183855239.html?src=rss]]></description>

It&#39;s a premium sequel to the Boox Palma, a phone-shaped E Ink device that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">originally became popular</a> as a &quot;healthy&quot; and less distracting alternative to scrolling on a smartphone. The Palma 2 Pro improves on the original with a 6.3-inch color E Ink screen (a Kaleido display, the same one used on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/kobos-new-ereaders-include-its-first-with-color-displays-040153210.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Kobo Libra Colour</a>) and support for 5G data through a new SIM card slot. The new Palma also runs Android 15, supports Boox&#39;s InkSense Plus stylus for taking notes and includes A-GPS for basic navigation. In other words, it&#39;s a much better smartphone replacement than before.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Boox-Note-Air5-C" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Boox-Note-Air5-C" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="A Boox Note Air5 C tablet in a keyboard cover." data-uuid="a7f11c9c-963b-45e2-adc7-fbb4ca40f27e"><figcaption>A Boox Note Air5 C tablet in a keyboard cover.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Boox</div></figure><p>The Note Air5 C is a bit more familiar. The 10.3-inch E Ink Android tablet is basically a larger version of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/booxs-new-go-7-e-ink-tablets-support-handwriting-with-a-46-stylus-182026839.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Boox Go 7 and Go 7 Color</a> devices Boox announced earlier this year, and an update to the Note Air4 C that&#39;s graced Engadget&#39;s list of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">best E Ink tablets</a>. The main changes Boox has made to this new model are that it runs Android 15 and supports a keyboard cover through the addition of pogo pins on the back. This makes it easier to type up documents on the device, and theoretically lets it support other accessories down the road. Alongside the keyboard, Boox says the new Note Air&#39;s Pen3 stylus is more comfortable to hold, and includes a removable cap for storing extra tips. Using an E Ink Kaleido display means the Note Air5 C might not offer quite the same experience as an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">iPad Pro with iPadOS 26</a>, but a newer version of Android and a keyboard gets it a lot closer.</p><p>Both of Boox&#39;s new devices are available to order now, and should ship in November. The Boox Palma 2 Pro costs $400, while the Boox Note Air5 C costs $530, or $607 in a bundle with a keyboard cover.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/boox-updates-popular-palma-e-ink-device-with-color-and-5g-connectivity-180000230.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is bringing more of its generative AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/ai-restyle-instagram-stories" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">to Instagram Stories</a>. With the changes, you can now use text prompts to remove or change objects in your photos or &quot;restyle&quot; the image completely.</p><p>The new tools live in a new &quot;restyle&quot; menu at the top of the Stories composer. You can select &quot;add,&quot; &quot;remove&quot; or &quot;change&quot; to tweak specific elements of your images. These features work a lot like either AI-based image editing tools; you can do things like remove stray objects from the backgrounds of photos or change up a person&#39;s outfit. You can also make more dramatic edits, like in the photo below, when I asked Meta AI to &quot;change the background to make it look like the cat is in space.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-23_at_10.17.39.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-23_at_10.17.39.png" style="height:1634px;width:1179px;" alt="I asked Meta AI to &quot;make it look like the cat is in space.&quot;" data-uuid="6c69a81e-1f01-42f4-8920-d88d2c4ca011"><figcaption>I asked Meta AI to &quot;make it look like the cat is in space.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Instagram</div></figure><p>The prompt bar can also be used to iterate on images without the &quot;add, change, remove&quot; constraints. It still takes a couple seconds for Meta AI to come up with its creations, but it’s an overall much faster and smoother experience than the company’s first “imagine” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-ai-image-generator-is-available-as-a-standalone-website-185953058.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">image generator</a> from nearly two years ago.</p><p>Meta has also added some preset effects that change the style of an entire image (e.g. anime, watercolor, 8-bit) without a prompt. There are also some presets specifically for &quot;short videos,&quot; according to Meta, though I&#39;m only seeing restyle options for photos for now.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Restyle_Flow_1.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Restyle_Flow_1.png" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="You can prompt Meta AI to edit your photos in Stories," data-uuid="1f6895c9-d7b7-489d-80ab-22b93ad7df00"><figcaption>You can prompt Meta AI to edit your photos in Stories,</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>Meta is also testing some &quot;restyle&quot; effects for text within Stories posts. This will allow people to mix things up from the same few font styles Instagram typically has available. Like with the image edits, you can ask Meta to customize the look of your words (e.g &quot;make it look like toy blocks&quot;).</p><p>The changes will make Meta AI&#39;s image and video editing features much more prominent to Instagram users, Meta AI has had the ability to change and restyle images <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-ai-can-now-talk-to-you-and-edit-your-photos-172853219.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">for some time</a>, but those features have been confined to chats with the Meta AI assistant. By now adding text-based prompts directly to Stories, these tools are a lot more accessible. Instagram is further encouraging users to share their new AI-inspired creations with a new &quot;add yours&quot; sticker that lets people share prompts others can iterate on.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-stories-is-getting-new-ai-powered-editing-tools-175500693.html?src=rss]]></description>

That seems to be the pitch behind Microsoft&#39;s new &quot;expressive, customizable and warm&quot; face of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-copilot-ai-gets-a-voice-and-the-ability-to-see-websites-you-browse-140030003.html">Copilot&#39;s voice mode</a>. The friendly blob listens, reacts and changes color in response to user interactions.</p>
<p>Microsoft sees Mico as an answer to what an &quot;AI companion&quot; looks like. The &quot;optional visual presence&quot; aims to listen and support without kissing ass. &quot;It will push back on you sometimes, but always respectfully,&quot; Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman  <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2025/10/23/human-centered-ai/">wrote</a> in a blog post.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But don&#39;t take my word for it. Get ready for the most exciting 39 seconds of your day, as you watch Mico silently spin and shift hues.</p>

<p>Clippy — I mean, Mico — is also part of a new Copilot feature called Learn Live. The student-focused voice mode will have Mico act as a Socratic tutor that &quot;guides you through concepts instead of just giving answers.&quot; Its tools will include questions, visual cues and interactive whiteboards.</p>
<p><em>The Verge</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/804106/microsoft-mico-copilot-ai-assistant-clippy">reports</a> that Mico is only available in the US, UK and Canada at launch. The character is now being enabled by default for Copilot&#39;s voice mode. But you can turn it off if talking to fictional characters isn&#39;t your thing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mico-is-microsofts-clippy-for-the-ai-age-174524597.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p><em>Assasin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2, Ubisoft announced today in its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Ubisoft;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cca828bc-bcd7-4319-b5fa-8cb88f52eae1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a23b61e9-78ec-4564-b07d-8670f13e7edc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ubisoft&amp;linkText=fall+roadmap+update&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi1jYS9nYW1lL2Fzc2Fzc2lucy1jcmVlZC9uZXdzLzZSYm1ZcnBzUDI0UEpZdFBscEoybVgvYXNzYXNzaW5zLWNyZWVkLXNoYWRvd3MtZmFsbC1yb2FkbWFwLXVwZGF0ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTIzYjYxZTktNzhlYy00NTY0LWIwN2QtODY3MGYxM2U3ZWRjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi1jYS9nYW1lL2Fzc2Fzc2lucy1jcmVlZC9uZXdzLzZSYm1ZcnBzUDI0UEpZdFBscEoybVgvYXNzYXNzaW5zLWNyZWVkLXNoYWRvd3MtZmFsbC1yb2FkbWFwLXVwZGF0ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfZL2O6bcX0HDJL927kj7zH7egJGlasKnS3M7HSnhbJu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fassassins-creed%2Fnews%2F6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">fall roadmap update</a>. The Switch 2 drop will include all of the game’s updates aside from the recent Claws of Awaji expansion, which will be added in 2026. It’ll also support cross-progression through Ubisoft Connect, allowing players to continue a current game on the new platform. The Switch 2 version of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will support a unique feature, too: touchscreen interactions in the menus, including the world map, store and hideout.</p>
<p>Ubisoft’s fall roadmap for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> has three major dates. On October 28, title update 10 will target the parkour system, adding an Advanced Parkour option and reintroducing the directional catch ledge mechanic, among other tweaks. This update will also add a new Animus themed activity called Corrupted Castles. Then, on November 25, Ubisoft will roll out a third story drop and a surprise collaboration. The new quest is called “A Puzzlement” and it’s sillier in tone than <em>Shadows</em> itself, “much more akin to something like <em>AC Odyssey</em>,” according to developers. In it, Naoe will learn a version of Yasuke’s war kick ability, and Yasuke will discover how to sneak-stun enemies. On December 2, the Switch 2 release caps off the roadmap.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Claws of Awaji expansion brought more than 10 hours of new content to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> in September, introducing new weapons, abilities, gear, enemy factions, bosses and story beats, plus a fresh region to explore. This will all come to the Switch 2 version of the game later in 2026.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An environmental watchdog group has suggested that millions of tons of discarded electronics from the US turn up in Asia and the Middle East each month, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/american-waste-causing-hidden-tsunami-southeast-asia-watchdog-126761306?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>ABC News</ins></em></a>. This has created a &quot;hidden tsunami&quot; of e-waste.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based Basel Action Network (BAN) conducted a two-year investigation into the matter and reportedly discovered at least ten US companies that exported used electronics to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia. This waste includes stuff like discarded phones and computers, which is an issue <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/electronic-waste-vietnam-recycling-workers-ewaste-fd437a066a967a3c8d2c8611a628c944"><ins>due to integrated toxic metals</ins></a> like lead, cadmium and mercury.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All told, around 2,000 containers of e-waste leave the US each month, totaling around 33,000 metric tons. The companies behind these shipments are described as &quot;e-waste brokers,&quot; as they don&#39;t recycle the waste themselves. Rather, they ship it off for someone else to deal with. These entities have names like Corporate eWaste Solutions, Semsotai, First America Metal Corp. and PPM Recycling.</p>
<p>The ten companies named in the report allegedly exported e-waste valued at over $1 billion between January of 2023 and February of 2025. Trade could top out at more than $200 million each month across the industry.</p>
<p>Semsotai has responded to the allegations, saying that it doesn&#39;t export scrap and only specializes in working components intended for reuse. It also accused BAN of bias. PPM Recycling accused BAN of exaggerating shipment volumes. Most of the companies named in the report, however, have chosen not to comment at this time.</p>
<p>The report also indicates that US e-waste shipments allegedly made up six percent of all US exports to Malaysia between the years 2023 to 2025. “Malaysia suddenly became this mecca of junk,” said Jim Puckett of BAN. Containers have also been tracked to Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and the UAE.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, Anthropic made Claude <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-can-now-reference-past-chats-if-you-want-it-to-211806343.html">capable of remembering past conversations</a>. With the update, people could reference specific chats, so that they wouldn&#39;t need to repeat themselves when revisiting a topic. Today, the company has begun out a new, enhanced memory feature set, with the included improvements coming to all paying users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of chatbots, including <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-can-now-remember-all-your-past-conversations-134642785.html">ChatGPT</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-advanced-can-now-recall-your-past-conversations-to-inform-its-responses-222407226.html">Gemini</a>, can remember past conversations, but Anthropic believes its implementation has a few legs up on the competition. For one, Claude will learn your preferences and work patterns over time, which Anthropic says will translate to the chatbot getting better at understanding how you work. Additionally, the company claims Claude is &quot;fully transparent&quot; about its memory, meaning users will see an &quot;actual synthesis&quot; of what it has recorded over time, instead of &quot;vague summaries.&quot; If you want to edit its memory, you can do so through conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9c58b760e80f482a86ade2c1993c6747"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PupmfSttxlc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the same, Anthropic has made it easy to compartmentalize the data Claude collects. When using the Projects feature to group conversations together, the chatbot will create a distinct memory space for each grouping. In this way, information Claude has saved from your work conversations won&#39;t bleed over to your personal chats, for example. If you&#39;re coming from ChatGPT or Gemini, Anthropic has  made it possible to import saved memories from those chatbots to Claude. You can also export any tidbits of context Claude saves to other AI platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of today&#39;s announcement, Anthropic notes it conducted extensive testing to determine if Claude&#39;s new capabilities would lead to greater sycophancy and more harmful conversations. &quot;Though this testing, we identified areas where Claude’s responses needed refinement and made targeted adjustments to how memory functions,&quot; the company said. &quot;These iterations helped us build and improve the memory feature in a way that allows Claude to provide helpful and safe responses to users.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Max subscribers can enable Claude new memory capabilities starting today, with availability for Pro users to follow in the coming days. The feature is fully optional, and won&#39;t be turned on unless you toggle it through the settings menu.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-can-now-compartmentalize-as-part-of-a-major-memory-upgrade-170000194.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People are evidently never buying quite enough stuff from Amazon to keep the company entirely happy, and it&#39;s calling on AI once again to push indecisive shoppers into locking down the purchase they’ve been eyeing up. The new tool, which Amazon calls <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-things-to-buy-help-me-decide-gen-ai"><ins>Help Me Decide</ins></a>, gives shoppers in the US personalized recommendations of products they should buy by analyzing their browsing history, searches and preferences.</p>
<p>It’s designed to &quot;help&quot; customers who have been looking at a number of products in a particular category, such as wireless headphones, to decide which one best suits their needs. The Help Me Decide button will pop up on a product detail page when it detects that you’ve been browsing for a while without making a final choice. If you choose to tap for AI assistance, it will pull together all the information it can find on your relevant shopping history and recommend the product it deems the right choice for you. It also recommends an alternative upgrade pick and a similar product for those on a budget.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Help Me Decide can also group together related searches. Amazon uses the example of the tool recommending an all-season tent for four people based on you previously looking for adult and kids’ sleeping bags that keep you warm, camping accessories and children’s hiking boots. The recommendation it chooses includes an explanation of why it’s the best pick for you based on its features and your previous purchases, and pulls in customer reviews to back it up. This suggests that how useful the recommendations are will ultimately come down to how much you take notice of customer reviews.</p>
<p>When searching for products to recommend to you, Help Me Decide leverages Amazon&#39;s Bedrock and SageMaker machine learning platforms, as well as its OpenSearch tool, to marry up all the different factors it takes into consideration. It follows the introduction of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-has-a-new-ai-powered-tool-for-shopping-125314016.html"><ins>Interests</ins></a> tool earlier this year, which uses AI to generate shopping results based on your natural language prompts. Back In May, the company also started <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-testing-ai-generated-hosts-that-talk-customers-through-product-features-153112886.html"><ins>experimenting</ins></a> with AI-generated hosts that can summarise products for you before you buy them, again relying heavily on customer reviews for its information.</p>
<p>Help Me Decide is live in the US now and can be found in the Amazon app (iOS and Android) and mobile browser. If you tap “Keep shopping for” it should show up, and will do the same on a product detail page after you’ve looked at a number of products in a related category.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-calls-on-ai-once-again-with-its-new-help-me-decide-shopping-tool-164516673.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The family of Adam Raine has filed an amended lawsuit against OpenAI. Raine died by suicide in April, and his family <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html">claims ChatGPT enabled the tragedy</a>. The updated lawsuit accuses the company of weakening self-harm safeguards in the period leading up to Raine&#39;s death, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/47b00423-1060-43c9-8c28-23631cb7a4d1"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. In addition, the company reportedly asked for a list of attendees and documents from Raine&#39;s memorial service.</p>
<p>The accusations in the amended lawsuit relate to GPT-4o, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-claims-that-its-free-gpt-4o-model-can-talk-laugh-sing-and-see-like-a-human-184249780.html">ChatGPT&#39;s default model</a> in the months before Raine&#39;s suicide. The suit says OpenAI removed crucial protections by instructing it not to &quot;change or quit the conversation&quot; when discussing self-harm. The filing claims the company &quot;truncated safety testing&quot; due to competitive pressures.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit reportedly says OpenAI weakened its guardrails again in February. At that point, the company allegedly instructed GPT-4o to &quot;take care in risky situations&quot; and &quot;try to prevent imminent real-world harm&quot; rather than refusing to engage on the subject. The filing adds that the model still had a series of &quot;disallowed content.&quot; Intellectual property rights and the manipulation of political opinions were said to be included. Suicide wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>In addition, <em>FT</em> reports that OpenAI requested a complete list of attendees at Adam Raine&#39;s memorial. The company asked for &quot;all documents relating to memorial services or events in the honour of the decedent including but not limited to any videos or photographs taken, or eulogies given...  as well as invitation or attendance lists or guestbooks.&quot;</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Raine family described the request as &quot;unusual&quot; and &quot;intentional harassment.&quot; They speculated that OpenAI would subpoena &quot;everyone in Adam’s life.&quot;</p>
<p>Engadget reached out to OpenAI for comment. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back. After the initial lawsuit was reported, the company acknowledged GPT-4o&#39;s shortcomings in some distressing situations. OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-adding-parental-controls-to-chatgpt-144128085.html">introduced ChatGPT parental controls</a> soon after. In addition, it&#39;s exploring a system to identify teen users and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/following-teen-suicide-openai-explores-automatic-underage-user-restrictions-151948711.html?guccounter=1">automatically restrict their usage</a>. The company says <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html">GPT-5</a>, the current default, is updated to better handle signs of distress.</p>
<p>Raine&#39;s parents, Matthew and Maria Raine, claim Adam&#39;s use of ChatGPT shot up dramatically after the model&#39;s February updates. They say that, in January, he only had a few dozen chats with the model, 1.6 percent of which referred to self-harm. But they claim that in April, his use rose to 300 chats daily, with 17 percent regarding self-harm.</p>
<p>The Raines first sued OpenAI in August. The wrongful death suit alleged that <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html?guccounter=1">ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts</a> before helping Adam plan his actual death. The filing says the company &quot;prioritized engagement over safety.&quot; Maria Raine concluded that &quot;ChatGPT killed my son.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-reportedly-asked-for-memorial-guest-list-in-teen-suicide-case-163309269.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently, web browsers are cool again. Two days after <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas-launches-on-macos-today-170735742.html">OpenAI launched its AI browser</a>, Microsoft has some updates for its Edge&#39;s AI mode. (Fancy that!) Copilot Mode, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-trials-copilot-mode-in-edge-201851903.html">introduced in July</a>, now has several features that were teased at launch.</p>
<p>First up: Copilot Actions, which is Microsoft&#39;s branding for AI-assisted, multi-step tasks. This feature is already <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/labs/experiments/copilot-actions">available</a> in the standard version of Copilot, but it&#39;s now being previewed for Edge&#39;s Copilot Mode. Microsoft&#39;s examples of Copilot Actions in Edge include unsubscribing from email newsletters or making a restaurant reservation.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another new (but previously announced) feature is Journeys. These are saved projects you can return to anytime. &quot;Remember that project you started a while back, but life got in the way?&quot; Microsoft&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/?p=26061">blog post</a> asks. &quot;No need to bookmark all those tabs.&quot; For example, if you&#39;re researching starting a business, Copilot can recap articles you&#39;ve read, suggest next steps and resurface a tutorial video you watched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a video from when Microsoft teased Journeys in July.</p>
<div id="6c8fae1578f74a3e91137378aee8f0de"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIckzrxpwtk?si=U7z7R4bMwdbXYy1_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Along similar lines, another new Copilot Mode feature is the option to let the assistant access your browsing history. One example Microsoft gives is chatting with Copilot about a clothing item you checked out last week. Or, ask it for movie recommendations based on content you previously liked.</p>
<p>Copilot requires explicit permission to access your private data for these new features. Microsoft&#39;s blog post stresses that your browser data is protected under the company&#39;s privacy statement and that Copilot &quot;only collects what&#39;s needed to improve your experience.&quot; The company also notes that you&#39;ll see clear visual cues so you know when Copilot is active.</p>
<p>Still, these features require loads of private information to be useful. Don&#39;t grant those permissions without first giving it some serious thought.</p>
<p>The new Copilot features are currently free in a US-only &quot;limited preview.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-makes-edges-copilot-mode-a-bit-smarter-160031147.html?src=rss]]></description>

FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have delayed <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition </em>— the Switch 2 version of the massively successful action RPG — until 2026. The port was announced back in April and it was originally slated to arrive sometime this year.</p><p>&quot;While development on #ELDENRING Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments,&quot; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a post</a> on the Elden Ring X account reads. &quot;We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.&quot;</p><p>Players got their first taste of the port during public demos at Gamescom in August, but performance issues were evident. At the time, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>IGN</em></a><em> </em>described the game as a &quot;disaster&quot; in the Switch 2&#39;s handheld mode, citing &quot;significant&quot; frame rate drops and a &quot;confusing&quot; button layout. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> saw &quot;multiple instances of frame drops and stuttering while out in the open world.&quot; So, taking extra time to make sure <em>Elden Ring </em>runs as smoothly as possible on the Switch 2 seems wise.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tarnished Edition includes the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/even-fromsoftware-agrees-elden-rings-dlc-was-too-difficult-153725812.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> expansion as well as new classes, weapons, armor and customization options for your horse, Torrent (other versions of the game will get these additions as well).

This &quot;leading European player in space&quot; could be a real rival to America&#39;s SpaceX, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a490b870-66b0-4745-be21-23f42057462d"><ins>reporting by </ins><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>The companies Airbus, Leonardo and Thales have finalized this deal. The new unnamed entity will be based in France and will employ around 25,000 people. Airbus will own 35 percent, while the other two companies will each own 32.5 percent.</p>

<p>Executives are hoping this company will better serve Europe&#39;s need for &quot;sovereignty&quot; in space and help it create a rival to SpaceX&#39;s Starlink communications network. Increasing a presence in space is also seen as a good thing for security and defense.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposed new company marks a pivotal milestone for Europe’s space industry. It embodies our shared vision to build a stronger and more competitive European presence in an increasingly dynamic global space market,&quot; the companies wrote in a joint statement. &quot;By pooling our talent, resources, expertise and R&amp;D capabilities, we aim to generate growth, accelerate innovation and deliver greater value to our customers and stakeholders.&quot;</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just bluster. Thales and Airbus have long been rivals in the satellite market, but it looks like they are friends now. Leonardo is known for space systems and services. Combining all three could actually give SpaceX a run for its money, but we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>There are no planned site closures, as the companies say that each home country will keep its existing capabilities. This will be a standalone company, so think of it as an extremely well-financed startup. The first task for the upstart? Reporting indicates it&#39;ll be to find more efficient ways to develop and manufacture satellites.</p>
<p>Discussions about this merger have been going on since 2019. Regulators still have to approve the deal, though the companies say they expect the new entity will be operational by 2027.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last 12 months have been pretty depressing for anyone invested in the long-term future of Xbox and the general health of the games industry. Back in May, Microsoft <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-percent-of-its-global-workforce-154755787.html">laid off</a> 3 percent of its global workforce, with the company’s gaming division being one of the big <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html">casualties</a>, and a number of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs-162200526.html">upcoming</a> titles were subsequently <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-the-studio-developing-the-perfect-dark-reboot-and-cancelling-the-game-182257902.html">canceled</a>. It painted a picture of a brand in crisis, but according to a new <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok">report</a>, Microsoft has been setting its gaming division unrealistic profit targets for several years.</p>
<p>Sources told <em>Bloomberg </em>that in 2023, Microsoft implemented an &quot;across-the-board goal&quot; of 30 percent profit margins, which the report says Microsoft calls &quot;accountability margins&quot; internally. As <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier reports, this target, which was set by Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood in fall 2023, is well above the recent industry average of 17-22 percent quoted by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Schreier adds that Xbox’s own average in the last six years is between 10 and 20 percent.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>S&amp;P Global analyst Neil Barbour told <em>Bloomberg </em>that Microsoft’s 30 percent target is the kind of margin &quot;usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it.&quot; This is despite its gaming division only landing at 12 percent in the first nine months of 2022, as quoted in the report.</p>
<p>A Microsoft spokesperson told <em>Bloomberg </em>that it views individual games and projects differently with regards to what constitutes success, adding that it sometimes has to making tough decisions, including ending development on games, so it can shift its resources toward the projects that are &quot;more aligned with our direction and priorities.&quot;</p>
<p>The new profit targets were introduced in the same year that Microsoft finally <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html">completed</a> its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, landing it hugely popular franchises such as Call of Duty and Diablo. Back in 2020 it <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-zenimax-acquisition-approved-eu-us-regulators-105057960.html">acquired</a> ZeniMax, the parent company of Bethesda, which means that long-running series like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout also now sit under the umbrella of Xbox’s gaming division.</p>
<p>Since 2018, Microsoft has been putting all of its first-party releases on Game Pass from day one, but this model has contributed to games failing to hit their 30 percent profit margin targets, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s sources. Xbox does offer developers a credit it calls &quot;member-weighted value,&quot; which takes into consideration factors such as the collective number of hours Game Pass subscribers have spent in a game, although this formula tends to benefit multiplayer titles the most. Going forward, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s sources said Microsoft is likely to favor funding games with cheap development costs and proven revenue-generators over riskier projects.</p>
<p>Xbox has been successful in bringing some of its first-party games to other platforms, including its primary rival in Sony’s PS5, with major titles such as <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/forza-horizon-5-is-on-the-ps5-so-i-no-longer-need-an-xbox-110016202.html"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hits-ps5-on-april-17-150021622.html"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>making the jump in the last 12 months. In the wake of Microsoft raising the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html">price</a> of Xbox consoles in the US last month, the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/microsoft-just-increased-all-xbox-prices-grab-one-before-the-hikes-go-into-effect-192628921.html">second</a> time it has done so in 2025, it also slapped <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">Game Pass Ultimate</a> with a 50 percent subscription fee hike at the start of October.

It's easy to set up and it integrates neatly into the Alexa smart home ecosystem. While you need a Blink Subscription for cloud storage ($3 for one camera, $10 for as many as you like), you can pick up a Sync Module 2 or Sync Module XR to store Blink Mini 2 footage locally. A Blink Subscription also enables specialized detection and alerts (e.g. for people and pets) and features like periodic photo captures.</p> 
<p>The Blink Mini 2 is weather resistant, though you'll need an adapter to use it outdoors. Additionally, you can use the Mini 2 as a plug-in chime that sounds when someone presses a Blink Video Doorbell.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Maxi Boch isn’t done with <em>Baby Steps</em>. Boch has enjoyed a productive career in game development and she knows how it feels to be creatively finished with a project. She experienced it at various points with <em>Rock Band</em>, <em>Dance Central</em>, <em>Fantasia: Music Evolved</em> and <em>Ape Out</em>, but on <em>Baby Steps</em>’ launch day,<em> done</em> was not the vibe.</p>
<p>“I&#39;ve been in the industry for a long time; I shipped broken strumbars for <em>Rock Band</em>,” Boch told Engadget. “I know that things change over time in this world, and it&#39;s not to say that <em>Baby Steps</em> is not done. It&#39;s done. But whether I&#39;m done with <em>Baby Steps</em>, this is a different story.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make a long one short: Boch’s collaborators, Bennett Foddy and Gabe Cuzzillo, were ready and excited to ship the game before she was, and so they did. <em>Baby Steps</em> hit PC and PlayStation 5 on September 23, 2025 (following one <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;slk:strategic delay;" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-prompts-another-game-delay-as-baby-steps-inches-back-153301303.html">strategic delay</a> to avoid the <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> release window).</p>
<p>From the player’s side, <em>Baby Steps</em> feels like a finely honed experience. It’s a walking simulator that follows Nate, a manchild in a gray onesie, as he attempts to scale a mountain and symbolically escape his parents’ basement. The player controls Nate’s legs individually, lifting each knee and carefully placing one foot in front of the other, learning how to walk in the very literal sense. <em>Baby Steps</em> succeeds because of its mechanical precision, but it excels because of its irreverent tone, magically surreal setting and AAA levels of polish. The mountain is a mix of childhood memories and adult anxieties represented by giant chess pieces, rude graffiti, and a crew of drinking, smoking, anthropomorphic donkeys who wander the cliffs with their dicks swinging free. Improvised dialogue between Nate and the NPCs turns each cutscene into a comedy sketch, but his journey also includes shocking revelations of existential numbness.</p>
<p>In <em>Baby Steps</em>, falling is just as much of a mechanic as walking. You will fall — dramatically, drastically, down crevasses that took hours to climb — and Nate will bounce and slide and eventually just lay there, mumbling to himself while his onesie fills with mud. And then you’ll pick him back up and start walking again. You’ll settle his steps into a soothing cadence. You’ll marvel at the way his sweat slowly saturates the material at the base of his spine, just above his bulbous butt. You’ll try to skip a cutscene and realize that in order to do so, you need to play a minigame with the X prompt. You’ll learn how to run. And somewhere along the way, you’ll remember what it feels like to just enjoy <em>play</em>.</p>

<p>As a former marching band member, I appreciate the sense of rhythm that’s built into <em>Baby Steps</em>, spurred by the animal sounds and natural-world musical cues that are tied to Nate’s footfall in specific areas. This is Boch’s area of expertise, and also the main reason she doesn’t feel finished with the game. Boch and her collaborators ended up using a slapdash mosaic of audio middleware and low-level software for <em>Baby Steps</em>, and a series of late-stage issues infused all of the songs in the game with incorrect samples. On launch day, the music and audio cues weren’t reacting as intended when Nate stepped, stumbled and fell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 23, the day that <em>Baby Steps</em> came out, Boch and I talked for an hour about its development process. Our conversation gently circled the topic of perseverance, the game’s core theme, but we only directly acknowledged it at minute 59. It’s not something you need to scream or repeat — tenacity is the obvious message in a game about climbing a mountain on wobbly feet — but it was fascinating to learn why Boch in particular was inspired to build a game about endurance.</p>
<h2 id="8178fd69-52dd-42ab-a054-750d45d8fe64">Making Baby Steps</h2>
<p>Boch, Foddy and Cuzzillo started working on <em>Baby Steps </em>right after they released <em>Ape Out</em> and cemented their names in the annals of frenetic, bloody and slightly silly indie history. Foddy was already known as the creator of <em>QWOP</em>, <em>GIRP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em>, and Boch as the rhythmic and hardware mastermind behind the largest AAA music games of the mid-2000s. The trio worked out of Boch and Foddy’s shared office at the NYU Game Center, where they were instructors and Cuzzillo was finishing up a graduate degree with <em>Ape Out</em> as his final project. They began prototyping <em>Baby Steps</em> around March 2019.</p>
<p>“At that point, I also started manifesting more symptoms of my chronic illness, and so I was in the midst of a period of an attempt at really intense reconditioning, which ultimately failed,” Boch said. “But when that period was over, I joined up with the crew again.”</p>
<p>Boch lives with a trifecta of chronic illnesses: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. EDS is a connective tissue disorder that affects the entire body, and it can cause hypermobility, fatigue, vision issues, fragile skin and an increased risk of vascular ruptures. People with POTS experience an abnormally large increase in heart rate when changing posture, and MCAS is a disorder that releases excessive amounts of histamine and similar chemicals in the body, causing random and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. It’s common for people with one of these diagnoses to also receive the others.</p>
<p>“It’s been an incredible challenge,” Boch said. “I think, easily, the hardest thing I&#39;ve had to deal with in my life. I think there&#39;s something very singular about each one of us, the three core members of this crew, and part of that is our ability to work fluidly across disciplines and the like. But another part of it is just a level of stick-to-it-iveness that my body has handily rejected, and so I&#39;m in a fight with it all the time.”</p>

<p>Boch has an arsenal of specialized tools to help her create games, including ergonomic (and very expensive) keyboards and a pair of glasses that act as a mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have found that most of what game development is about and is oriented around is kind of hostile to those of us with poor fine-motor skills, and it&#39;s an odd thing to be experiencing alongside the making of a thing that is stridently difficult,” Boch said. “There&#39;s odd moments in it, where I have been going through physical therapy processes to retrain my actual walking, alongside working on this thing that is deconstructing walking. A very odd subset of feelings.”</p>
<p>Boch said the hardest thing for her to contend with is the moment-to-moment unpredictability of her health. But by the fall of 2019, she was back in the office with Cuzzillo and Foddy, iterating on the ideas that would eventually become <em>Baby Steps</em>. Cuzzillo and Foddy were feeling slightly discouraged at this point: They were four or five ideas deep, messing around with a competitive, real-time strategy game or a SimCity type of experience, but nothing was quite right. Boch encouraged them to return to their ridiculous, mechanically-driven roots.</p>
<p>“I think it started to become a lot clearer in everyone&#39;s mind when it started to take on aspects of Bennett’s work,” Boch said. “The first handful of years of <em>Baby Steps</em>’ development, we were all playing various sorts of roles. The work of VO direction, recording and narrative development was something we were all working on together. Some of the foundational narrative premise things are concepts that I brought to the table as ways to try and prop up some world around this character. Lots of tools building and infrastructural work and all of the foundational stuff that makes it possible for a team that&#39;s so tiny to make a thing that&#39;s so strong.”</p>
<p>The <em>Baby Steps</em> crew shared a house in upstate New York during the first winter of the pandemic in 2020. They hiked together and worked on the game at one big folding table, enjoying the mountain air with their partners and each other. There were no strict roles on the game development side, with Boch, Cuzzillo and Foddy contributing to all aspects at once, including voice work.</p>
<p>“Over time, there are aspects of the narrative development that became increasingly more personal to my collaborators,” Boch said. “And they started to feel more comfortable in a director-less environment in terms of coaxing naturalistic performances out of themselves, and so that work became more disjointed.”</p>

<p>By the time they were recording voices and finding characters through improvisation in the sound booth, Boch happened to be in the early stages of transitioning. Vocal training and voice acting are a tricky mix, it turns out.</p>
<p>“I kind of recognized what it was going to take to be doing voiceover performance myself in the midst of my early transition, and I made the call that it was not the right activity for me,” Boch said. “So my characters were cut — it was like one or two — and I endeavored to strike up some novel collaborations on the audio side.”</p>
<p>For the past year and half in particular, Boch has been focused on all things audio in <em>Baby Steps</em>, as well as overseeing big-picture production tasks. She brought on a collaborator from the world of hardcore techno music, Jack Schlesinger, and he primarily handled system architecture details while Boch dealt with creative aspects. DJ Ashe Kilbourne and harpist Emily Hopkins rounded out the list of audio contributors. When she was able, Boch took an improvised sound kit into the wild and collected nature noises, and the team stitched together a reactive audio system using middleware and leftover bits of software from the Harmonix days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When <em>Baby Steps</em>’ dynamic audio kicks in, and the boops, chirps and thunks start layering on top of one another as Nate waddles along, it adds a delicious sense of hypnosis to the game. Unfortunately, the audio systems fell apart in the final weeks before launch. The VO was fine, but many of the sounds and beats weren’t populating in the right places at the proper times, and Boch’s vision wasn’t being clearly communicated day-one.</p>
<p>“The foundations of game audio tooling are terrible,” Boch said. She continued, “The world of game audio, from my perspective, is a bunch of people who are sitting on top of a bunch of work they&#39;ve done to write drivers to talk to consoles, and a bunch of work they&#39;ve done to forge relationships with console manufacturers so that their audio technology will be licensed by the two major engines. But they&#39;re both trash. I will not endorse either one, and I will not say that either one is capable of doing the kind of work that I need done.”</p>
<p>Since launch, the <em>Baby Steps</em> audio team has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1;slk:released patches;" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1281040/view/535488328615593313?l=english">released patches</a> addressing the sampling issues and adjusting dynamic audio cues across the game. An imminent update will introduce animals singing along with the songs, outdoor and indoor reverb simulations across all sounds, and other fixes. Boch has additional updates and surprises planned, including a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1;slk:Baby Steps Fi Beats livestream;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD9lYUXT37o">Baby Steps Fi Beats livestream</a> to showcase the game’s music on YouTube. By November, the audio team will be focused on composing.</p>

<p><em>Baby Steps</em> is only going to get more immersive as the audio improvements roll out. And if you listen closely, you’ll be able to hear Boch voicing a few small roles throughout the game.</p>
<p>“I play, like, a baby and a hypothetical gay partner for Nate and a bunch of other random characters,” Boch said. “There&#39;s some cosmic sadness on my part, that the timing worked out in exactly the ways that it did. But I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s the cards you&#39;re dealt. It&#39;s important to do the thing that&#39;s true to you.”</p>
<p>One glaring truth that shook out during the <em>Baby Steps</em> development process was the supremely close and infectious bond between Cuzzillo and Foddy. The game’s dialogue and cutscenes are composed of off-the-cuff conversations and rambling inside jokes between Cuzzillo and Foddy, and each of these moments is delightful in a chaotic kind of way. Like a classic comedy duo, these developers share an undeniable resonance. They’re even born on the same day <em>and</em> they have older brothers with the same birthday, two facts that Boch finds adorable.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m not a horoscope person at all, but they have a kind of cosmic level of synchronicity that they both acknowledge, but also are a little bit like, ‘What, this?’” Boch said. “They have plenty that they disagree about and plenty that they bicker about, but there&#39;s something about their orientations toward the world that&#39;s perplexing and generative. They are immensely talented folks.”</p>
<h2 id="e6e9ccc4-c9f6-4062-bb40-15b16269adcc">Taking Baby Steps</h2>
<p>In the end, Cuzzillo and Foddy felt finished with <em>Baby Steps</em> before Boch. She didn’t want to hold their joy hostage, so the audio team made it work and they shipped the game on September 23, 2025, published by Devolver Digital.</p>
<p>“That kind of dream-deferred shit is emotional torture, and so I had no interest in putting them through that, they had no interest in going through that,” Boch said. “It makes sense to me to be landing in the place that we are.”</p>

<p>I caught up with Boch three weeks after <em>Baby Steps</em>’ release date to see if she was feeling more done, now that the launch-day dust had settled. She said it was a hard question.</p>
<p>“There is so much more that I am interested in exploring, and so much more that I have set up in terms of pins to knock down,” she said. “I think this is a struggle that highlights the inherent tension of trying to make art at this boundary between a fine art practice and a commercial art practice. I think that for the sake of the work, and for the sake of me and my team as artists, the tech I have built deserves to continue to be refined in a different context, one wherein sound is more paramount. That&#39;s where we&#39;re headed.”</p>
<p>This is a tease of what’s next for Boch, even though she’s still finishing up <em>Baby Steps</em>. She’s planning on leaving NYU, spurred by the unpredictability of her health, but she’s not done making games. Her next one will be more personal.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s important to me to share what I&#39;m doing with people,” Boch said in September. “I think that there is not enough in the world of games that puts audio at its very center. I think that my personal ambitions and future ambitions are definitely leaning more in that direction by the day. I had a long time of needing to get some space from interactive audio as The Thing. Where my winds are blowing is in that direction.”</p>
<p><em>Baby Steps</em> exists in its current form because Boch and her teammates were able to adapt and endure. They were honest about what was working, what wasn’t and what could, and they leaned into the aspects that felt the most natural to them. Boch in particular set aside her ego, listened to her body, and took things day by day. You know, baby steps.</p>
<p>“The process of transition is one that involves an enormous amount of self-reflection and a growing sense of self knowledge,” Boch said. “Ultimately, that process for me was kind of orthogonal to the storytelling of <em>Baby Steps</em>. There&#39;s a lot that comes from lived experience, and from commiserating and sharing that lived experience between Bennett and Gabe, and you can see that very clearly in the work. There&#39;s also just ways in which that process was illuminating to me in terms of inherent differences. There&#39;s an aspect of it that came alongside the necessity of slowing down, and then the subsequent necessity of staying inside that hit with my chronic illness and then Covid. There was a way in which I was more with myself at that moment than I’ve ever been.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/baby-steps-isnt-done-with-maxi-boch-140000613.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla said it &quot;achieved record vehicle deliveries globally&quot; for the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-third-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments">third quarter of 2025</a> with a total of 497,099 vehicles delivered. It also reported a record-breaking revenue of $28.1 billion, which is 12 percent higher than the same quarter in 2024. Tesla&#39;s net income, however, slid by 37 percent year-over-year, due to several factors, namely lower EV prices, an increase in spending on AI and other R&amp;D projects, and of course, tariffs. Vaibhav Taneja, the automaker&#39;s finance chief, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql9yqxllqdo">said during the earnings call</a> that tariffs on imported car parts and raw materials cost the company more than $400 million in the third quarter. Taneja added that he expects research and development spending to continue to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/804972/tesla-robotaxi-safety-monitor-remove-austin-musk">said that he expects</a> the company to deploy its first robotaxis with no drivers behind the wheel by the end of this year, starting with some parts of Austin. If you&#39;ll recall, Tesla launched its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/teslas-first-robotaxi-rides-kick-off-in-austin-texas-100015076.html">first robotaxi rides</a> in Austin, Texas back in June. There have been several reports of the robotaxis <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/teslas-first-robotaxi-rides-are-already-running-into-a-few-bumps-205308245.html">running into issues</a> since then, including an instance wherein one <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-tesla-robotaxi-inexplicably-drove-into-a-parked-car-171004400.html">drove into a parked car</a>. Musk said Tesla was &quot;obviously being very cautious about the deployment,&quot; but that he expects his company to be operating fully driverless vehicles in eight to ten new states before 2025 ends.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Musk revealed, as well, that Tesla&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-02-tesla-is-quietly-making-its-own-ai-chip-for-self-driving-cars.html">homegrown AI5 artificial intelligence chip</a> will be manufactured both by Samsung in Texas and by TSMC in Arizona. Tesla is apparently aiming to manufacture more than it needs for its electric vehicles and upcoming Optimus robots so that it can use the excess units in its data centers. He clarified that Tesla isn&#39;t going to stop using NVIDIA chips, but that it will continue using them in combination with AI5.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-profits-plunge-despite-record-revenue-and-deliveries-133004231.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-warn-whatsapp-and-messenger-users-against-scams-120048067.html">Meta</a> has removed a deepfake AI video of Irish presidential candidate Catherine Connolly, which featured a false depiction of the politician saying that she&#39;s withdrawing from the election. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2025/10/22/meta-removes-ai-video-purporting-to-show-catherine-connolly-quitting-presidential-race/"><em>The Irish Times</em></a>, the AI-generated video was shared nearly 30,000 times on Facebook just days before Ireland&#39;s election on October 24 prior to it being removed from the website. Connolly called the video &quot;a disgraceful attempt to mislead voters and undermine [Ireland&#39;s] democracy&quot; and assured voters that she was &quot;absolutely still a candidate for President of Ireland.&quot;</p>
<p>The video was posted by an account which had named itself RTÉ News AI, which is not affiliated with the actual Irish public service broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann. It copied the likenesses not just of Connolly, but also of legitimate RTÉ journalist Sharon Ní Bheoláin and correspondent Paul Cunningham. &quot;It is with great regret that I announce the withdrawal of my candidacy and the ending of my campaign,&quot; the AI version of Connolly said in the fake video. Ní Bheoláin was shown reporting about the announcement and confirming the candidate&#39;s withdrawal from the race. The AI version of Cunningham then announced that the election was cancelled and will no longer take place, with Connolly&#39;s opponent Heather Humphreys automatically winning. Connolly, an independent candidate, is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2025/1022/1539875-presidential-election/">leading</a> the latest polls with 44 points.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta removed the RTÉ News AI account completely after being contacted by the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/presidential-election/catherine-connolly-files-complaint-to-electoral-commission-over-viral-ai-deepfake-videos-on-facebook-that-generated-160000-views/a2078741749.html"><em>Irish Independent</em></a>. The company told <em>The Irish Times</em> that it removed the video and account for violating its community standards, particularly its policy prohibiting content that impersonates or falsely represents people. Irish media regulator Coimisiún na Meán said it was aware of the video and had asked Meta about the immediate measures it took in response to the incident. Meta has been struggling to keep deepfake and maliciously edited videos featuring celebrities and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/maliciously-edited-joe-biden-video-can-stay-on-facebook-metas-oversight-board-says-110042024.html">politicians</a> under control for years now.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox is integrating some of Dash&#39;s AI features into its main app, giving its users access to a smarter search function, summaries and contextual answers from the files they&#39;ve uploaded to the app. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dropboxs-new-tools-reimagine-the-cloud-service-as-your-ai-sidekick-171544676.html">launched Dash</a> back in 2023 as an &quot;AI-powered universal search bar&quot; that people can use to find information in their work-related apps like Slack, Canva, Google Workspace and Microsoft Outlook. However, it&#39;s primarily a tool for larger businesses that use Dropbox. This time, though, the company is bringing its search capabilities into the main app for everyone to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, the Dash AI-powered capabilities in the Dropbox app are only available to a small group of users, but they will be widely available in the coming months. Like most other AI chatbots, the AI in the app will allow users to use natural language to describe what they&#39;re looking for, whether it&#39;s a PDF or a photo. They can also ask the AI to summarize or find what&#39;s new in specific files already in their account. Dropbox is working with a startup called Mobius Labs, as well, to give Dash AI the capabilities to search within videos, audio and images &quot;soon.&quot;</p>

The new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-luna-redesign-gamenight-prime" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Amazon Luna</a> is available at no additional cost for Prime subscribers, and now includes new beginner-friendly multiplayer games.</p><p>If you&#39;ve tried Luna in the past — or most other game streaming services for that matter — the biggest change Amazon is making is the addition of GameNight. It&#39;s a collection of multiplayer games reworked so they can be controlled with a smartphone, to make it as easy as possible for friends and family to play. GameNight includes titles like<em>The Jackbox Party Pack 9</em>, and reimagined versions of <em>Tetris Effect: Connected</em> and <em>Angry Birds</em>, among other options. GameNight also adds at least one original game, <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em> , which places players in faux-courtroom battles judged by an AI-powered facsimile of Snoop Dogg.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjPSCmibeFs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As before, Luna also gives you access to games that need to be played with a controller (either connected over Bluetooth or over Wi-Fi in the case of Amazon&#39;s Luna Controller). To pair with the update, Amazon is adding <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>,<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> to the Luna library. For an additional $10 a month for Luna Premium (formerly known as Luna+) you can also unlock an even larger library.</p><p>If you already have a Prime subscription, these changes make Luna an easy sell. You might have to deal with some buffering, but in exchange, you get access to free entertainment for your next party, and a premium Xbox game without <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazons-revamped-luna-streaming-service-is-available-now-130000613.html?src=rss]]></description>

Having a portable battery that can stay on your person without weighing you down is crucial for the busiest among us.

<p>As you can probably guess from its name, Baseus’ power bank has a 5,000mAh capacity and is Qi2-certified. In our testing. It gave our tester iPhone 15 a 43 percent bump in battery in 42 minutes, which returned the phone to 91 percent. It has a curved design and is wrapped in soft silicone, making it easy to grip in a pinch.</p> 
<p>As a reminder, MagSafe charging is supported on iPhone 12 models and later, though you’ll need an iPhone 13 or later to reach the 15W charging speed on a third-party Qi2 accessory such as the one featured in this deal.</p>

We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.</p> 
<p>Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ubisoft&#39;s Massive Entertainment, the developer of The Division series, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/i-really-want-to-like-star-wars-outlaws-160032476.html"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandoras-adventurous-spirit-might-just-win-you-over-160024430.html"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a> is offering some employees buyouts as it attempts to &quot;realign&quot; its teams, the company said in a<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732"> post on X</a>. The move is designed to &quot;strengthen our roadmap,&quot; Massive wrote, as it focuses on The Division series along with its Snowdrop engine and Ubisoft Connect. Ubisoft notably didn&#39;t mention Star Wars and Avatar in that statement, an omission that may effectively spell the demise of those franchises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Massive framed the layoffs as a &quot;voluntary career transition program... supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.&quot; Workers at the Massive studio in Malm, Sweden can volunteer until December 13 for the package, which primarily targets people between projects waiting for new assignments, according to the French news site <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/les-reductions-d-effectifs-chez-ubisoft-touchent-le-studio-derriere-le-jeu-video-star-wars-outlaws-20251022"><em>Le Figaro</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another Ubisoft studio, Helsinki-based RedLynx, also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">announced</a> that it was restructuring &quot;as part of Ubisoft&#39;s global efforts to simplify, reduce costs and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency.&quot; If implemented, the proposal would result in a maximum of 60 workers being let go, RedLynx said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the underperformance of key titles like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, Ubisoft has shuttered offices and laid off workers at offices in San Francisco, London and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html">Leamington</a>. Last year, the company&#39;s headcount <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">dropped</a> from 20,279 to 18,666 at the end of September. Earlier this month, Ubisoft partnered with Tencent to launch <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-launches-its-new-tencent-backed-subsidiary-194750403.html">Vantage Studios</a>, which now houses the company&#39;s tentpole franchises: Assassin&#39;s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-laying-off-more-workers-and-offering-voluntary-buyouts-120030931.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So Samsung made a &quot;Vision Pro Lite.&quot; That was my immediate takeaway after this week&#39;s debut of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-everything-you-need-to-know-111532664.html" data-i13n="slk:Galaxy XR;cpos:1;pos:1">Galaxy XR</a>, the first Android XR device to hit the market. While Samsung deserves credit for offering something close to the Vision Pro for nearly half the price, an $1,800 headset still won&#39;t get mainstream consumers rushing out the door to experience the wonders of mixed reality. And with the limited amount of content in Android XR at the moment, the Galaxy XR is in the same position as the Vision Pro: It&#39;s just a well-polished developer kit.&nbsp;</p><p>The only logical reason to buy a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-a-smarter-more-open-take-on-apples-vision-pro-for-half-the-price-020044642.html" data-i13n="slk:Galaxy XR;cpos:2;pos:1">Galaxy XR</a> would be to test out apps for Android XR. If you just want to experience VR and dabble in a bit of augmented reality, you&#39;re better off spending that money on a gaming laptop and the excellent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html" data-i13n="slk:$500 Meta Quest 3;cpos:3;pos:1">$500 Meta Quest 3</a>. (The Meta Quest Pro, the company’s first high-end mixed reality device, was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-will-stop-selling-the-quest-2-and-quest-pro-by-the-end-of-the-year-173704500.html" data-i13n="slk:unceremoniously killed;cpos:4;pos:1">unceremoniously killed</a> after launching at an eye-watering $1,500.)&nbsp;</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJkbTave_I8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>But even for developers, the Galaxy XR feels like it&#39;s lacking, well, <em>vision</em>. Samsung has done an admirable job of copying almost every aspect of the Vision Pro: The sleek ski goggle design, dual micro-OLED displays and hand gesture interaction powered by a slew of cameras and sensors. But while Apple positioned the Vision Pro as its first stab at spatial computing, an exciting new platform where we can use interactive apps in virtual space, Samsung and Google are basically just gunning to put Android on your face.&nbsp;</p><p>There aren&#39;t many custom-built XR apps, aside from Google&#39;s offerings like Maps and Photos. (Something that also reminds me of the dearth of real tablet apps on Android.) And the ability to view 360-degree videos on YouTube has been a staple of every VR headset for the last decade — it&#39;s not exactly notable on something that costs $1,800. Samsung and Google also haven&#39;t said much about how they plan to elevate XR content. At least Apple is attempting to push the industry forward with its 8K Immersive Videos, which look sharper and more realistic than low-res 360-degree content.</p><p>For the most part, it seems as if Google is treating Android XR as another way to force its Gemini AI on users. In its press release for the Galaxy XR, Samsung notes that it&#39;s &quot;introducing a new category of AI-native devices designed to deliver immersive experiences in a form factor optimized for multimodal AI.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>…What?&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to being a crime against the English language, what the company is <em>actually</em> pitching is fairly simple: It&#39;s just launching a headset that can access AI features via camera and voice inputs.&nbsp;</p><p>Who knows, maybe Gemini will make Android XR devices more capable down the line. But at the moment, all I&#39;m seeing in the Galaxy XR is another Samsung device that&#39;s shamelessly aping Apple, from the virtual avatars to specific pinch gestures. And Google&#39;s history in VR and interactive content doesn&#39;t inspire much hope about Android XR. Don&#39;t forget how it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stops-selling-cardboard-vr-goggles-141926732.html" data-i13n="slk:completely abandoned Google Cardboard;cpos:5;pos:1">completely abandoned Google Cardboard</a>, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-google-daydream-view-smartphone-vr-pixel-4.html" data-i13n="slk:short-lived Daydream project;cpos:6;pos:1">short-lived Daydream project</a> and its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html" data-i13n="slk:hyped up Stadia cloud service;cpos:7;pos:1">hyped up Stadia cloud service</a>. Stadia&#39;s death was particularly galling, since Google initially pitched it as a way to revolutionize the very world of gaming, only to let it fall on its face.</p><p>There’s no doubt that Samsung, Apple and Meta have a ton of work left ahead in the world of XR. Samsung is at least closer to delivering something under $1,000, and Meta also recently launched the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="slk:$800 Ray-Ban Display;cpos:8;pos:1">$800 Ray-Ban Display</a>. But price is only one part of the problem. <em>Purpose </em>is another issue entirely. After living with the Vision Pro since its debut, I can tell that Apple is at least thinking a bit more deeply about what it’s like to wear a computer on your face. Just look at the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/visionos-2-adds-spatial-photos-new-ui-gestures-and-improved-mac-mirroring-172746000.html" data-i13n="slk:upgrades its made around ultra-wide Mac mirroring;cpos:9;pos:1">upgrades its made around ultra-wide Mac mirroring</a>, or the way <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-brings-spatial-persona-avatars-to-vision-pro-to-help-you-feel-less-alone-144824140.html" data-i13n="slk:Spatial Personas;cpos:10;pos:1">Spatial Personas</a> make it feel as if you’re working alongside other people.

The experience making these headsets could help Google, Apple and Meta develop future AR glasses, or eyewear that offer some sort of XR experience (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-is-working-on-xr-smart-glasses-with-warby-parker-and-gentle-monster-042632170.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN3AS3RuWzm6cSKBPAg60Wa73X9A_jlynRArMOI4aiiFkxcZc9sa5pp7L-DnDLRHi84tDd4A1QMnk6rLk_sujE22JMP0XTug3AU-qtzWlQNPlMMuBkbyrv599r98yLgMpVJcJSo8_9R9sURZRY08Pj6PMwThJqAPpUybHHtbje7U" data-i13n="slk:Samsung already has something in the works;cpos:12;pos:1">Samsung already has something in the works</a> with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster).

<h3 id="jump-link-design">Design</h3> 
<p>When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>For gamers, there are also <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html">gaming headsets</a> that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.</p> 
<p>Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.</p> 
<p>Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation">Type of noise cancellation</h3> 
<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> 
<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-customization">Customization</h3> 
<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-headphones">How we test noise-canceling headphones</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/">podcasts</a>, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.</p> 
<p>Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> 
<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.</p> 
<p>ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-noise-canceling-headphones-we-tested">Other noise-canceling headphones we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-max">AirPods Max</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326-143034684.html">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dyson-on-trac">Dyson On-Trac</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sonos-ace">Sonos Ace</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-ult-wear">Sony ULT Wear</h3> 
<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-studio-pro">Beats Studio Pro</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> 
<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">Px8</a> is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h3> 
<p>While <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html">this</a> is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html">best wireless headphones</a>, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-noise-canceling-headphones-faqs">Noise-canceling headphones FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-block-all-noise">Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3> 
<p>Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-wired-vs-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones">Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?</h3> 
<p>In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-impact-sound-quality">Does noise cancellation impact sound quality?</h3> 
<p>ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss]]></description>

It's very light for travel or street photography, but has some powerful features like 6.2K video and subject-detect autofocus, all at a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The original X-T30 first arrived in 2019 and was replaced in 2022 by the X-T30 II that was more of a mild update than an all-new camera. However, the X-T30 III has a number of key updates that bring it in line with other recent models <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilms-x-m5-is-its-first-sub-1000-camera-in-years-140715888.html">like the X-M5</a> and X-T50.

<p>The X-T30 III is meant to be taken on adventures, so it's still very light at just 378 grams or 13.33 ounces, a touch less than the previous model. Control-wise, the biggest addition is a film simulation dial just like the one on the X-M5 and X-T50, replacing the mode dial from the X-T30 II. It's designed to make it easy to switch between film simulations like Reala Ace and Nostalgic Neg, while offering three customizable positions to let users save "recipes" of their own making.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Otherwise, the X-T30 III has a generous complement of dials and buttons something that allows for precise control but may intimidate newbies. The rear display tilts up but doesn't flip out, and the 2.36-million-dot electronic viewfinder is on the low end for resolution. The main feature missing on the X-T30 III is in-body stabilization, so you'll need either a stabilized (OIS) lens or electronic stabilization for video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Burst shooting speeds are the same as before at 8 fps with the mechanical shutter and 20 fps in electronic mode. However, more of your shots are likely to be sharp thanks to the updated, faster autofocus. Along with the extra speed, Fujifilm introduced new AI subject detection modes including Auto-Tracking, Animals, Birds and Vehicles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Video also gets a big upgrade. The X-T30 III can now shot 6.2K 30 fps video using the entire sensor (up from 4K 30p before), or 4K at 60 fps with a mild 1.18x crop. All of those resolutions are available with 10-bit modes to boost dynamic range. However, the X-T30 III lacks in-body stabilization, has a weird 2.5mm microphone input and a display that only tilts and doesn't flip out. That makes it fine as a hybrid camera, but if you mostly shoot video, a model like the X-S20 may be a better choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other key features include a microHDMI port for RAW video output, a single SD memory card (that's of the low-speed UHS-I variety unfortunately), and improved battery life with up to 425 shots to a charge. Fujifilm also introduced a new lens, the Fujinon XC13-33mmF3.5-6.3 OIS that offers an interesting ultrawide full-frame equivalent zoom range of around 20-50mm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">AirPods</a> or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.</p> 
<p>For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.</p> 
<p>When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.</p> 
<p>Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.</p> 
<p>We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-labels-say-apple-musics-spatial-audio-royalties-only-benefit-the-biggest-player-211730447.html">Spatial Audio</a>, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-wireless-earbuds">How we test wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).</p> 
<p>To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-we-tested">Other wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wf-c710n">Sony WF-C710N</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-c710n-review-more-than-midrange-180018400.html">WF-C710N</a> is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-powerbeats-pro-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</h3> 
<p>The newest version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-buds-3">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-and-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review-airpods-clones-that-actually-deliver-171024116.html">Galaxy Buds 3</a> combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sennheiser-momentum-sport">Sennheiser Momentum Sport</h3> 
<p>I really like the overall shape of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review-fitness-earbuds-that-lack-finesse-130036233.html">Momentum Sport</a> earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-solo-buds">Beats Solo Buds</h3> 
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-solo-buds-review-exactly-what-youd-expect-for-80-170742296.html">Solo Buds</a> for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-ultra-open-earbuds">Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</h3> 
<p>Bose created something very unique for <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">this set of earbuds</a> that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-audio-technica-ath-twx7">Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-twx7-review-good-earbuds-with-frustrating-flaws-160054450.html">These stick buds</a> have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mw09">Master &amp; Dynamic MW09</h3> 
<p>Retooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master--dynamic-mw09-review-premium-materials-impeccable-clarity-132522028.html">MW09</a> has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-earbud-faqs">Wireless earbud FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-considered-good-battery-life-for-true-wireless-earbuds">What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Most wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-sound-quality-better-on-headphones-or-earbuds">Is sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is also outstanding.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-wireless-earbuds-have-the-longest-battery-life">Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?</h3> 
<p>With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-audio-technica-ath-cks5tw-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW</a>. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08</a> offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-are-waterproof">What wireless earbuds are waterproof?</h3> 
<p>There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-earbuds-stay-in-ears-the-best">Which earbuds stay in ears the best?</h3> 
<p>A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-work-with-ps5">What wireless earbuds work with PS5?</h3> 
<p>PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-inzone-gaming-monitors-headsets-specs-pricing-availability-210056794.html">Sony’s own gaming headsets</a> come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/smart-glasses-amazon-delivery-drivers">revealed</a> that it&#39;s currently working on smart glasses designed for delivery drivers, confirming <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/amazon-is-reportedly-developing-separate-ar-glasses-for-customers-and-its-drivers-230826640.html">previous reports</a> about the project. The company said that glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision to detect what their cameras are seeing. Drivers then get guidance through the glasses&#39; heads-up display (HUD) embedded right into the lens. Based on Amazon&#39;s announcement, it&#39;s been working on the glasses for a while, and hundreds of delivery drivers had already tested early versions to provide the company with feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The glasses automatically activate after the driver parks their vehicle. They then show users the right packages to deliver, according to their location. Users will see the list of packages they have to take out on the HUD, and the glasses can even tell them if they pull out the right package from their pile. When they get out of their vehicle, the glasses will display turn-by-turn navigation to the delivery address and will also show them hazards along the way, as well as help them navigate complex locations like apartment buildings. Simply put, the device allows them to find delivery addresses and drop off packages without having to use their phones. Drivers will even be able to capture proof of delivery with the wearable.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon&#39;s glasses will be paired with a vest that&#39;s fitted with a controller and a dedicated emergency button drivers can press to call emergency services along their routes. The device comes with a swappable battery to ensure all-day use and can be fitted with prescription and transitional lenses if the drivers need them. Amazon expects future versions of the glasses to be able to notify drivers if they&#39;re dropping a package at the wrong address and to be able to detect and notify them about more hazardous elements, like if there&#39;s a pet in the yard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the annual event wherein the company announced the device, Amazon transportation vice president Beryl Tomay <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-sees-faster-delivery-speeds-with-hi-tech-driver-eyeglasses-ai-2025-10-22/">said</a> it &quot;reduces the need to manage a phone and a package&quot; and helps drivers &quot;stay at attention, which enhances their safety.&quot; She also said that among the testers, Amazon had seen time savings of 30 minutes for a given shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company didn&#39;t say anything about developing smart glasses for consumers, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Information;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b6fad8ec-d14c-4873-b26b-b65ed0cfd014&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;linkText=The+Information%27s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYW1hem9uLWRldmVsb3BpbmctYXItZ2xhc3Nlcy1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtbWV0YSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjZmYWQ4ZWMtZDE0Yy00ODczLWIyNmItYjY1ZWQwY2ZkMDE0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYW1hem9uLWRldmVsb3BpbmctYXItZ2xhc3Nlcy1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtbWV0YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeWTYmf5xnX3hTbOoz9zv3u2ODwXP82dl1eQsLRjRSGB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-developing-ar-glasses-challenge-meta" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-ar-glasses-challenge-meta"><em>The Information&#39;s</em></a> previous report said that it&#39;s also working on a model for the general public slated to be released in late 2026 or early 2027.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/amazons-smart-glasses-with-ai-will-help-its-drivers-deliver-packages-faster-041009681.html?src=rss]]></description>

Now, Also is showing off its first products: a lineup of e-bikes and two pedal-assisted electric quads.&nbsp;</p><p>The TM-B e-bike is Also&#39;s attempt at a do-it-all e-bike that can adapt to different use cases whether that&#39;s daily commuting, trail riding or kid and cargo-hauling. It sports a modular frame that can also accommodate a bench seat or rear cargo rack that supports up to 35KG of weight. </p><p> The different seats can be easily swapped out without extra tools. Instead,  a button on the bike’s touchscreen display controls a latching mechanism that releases the seat. It only comes in one frame size, but Also says it should be able to adapt to &quot;multiple body sizes,” thanks to different seat sizes and styles. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/tmb_seat_swap.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/tmb_seat_swap.jpg" style="height:2459px;width:1920px;" alt="The bench seat for the TM-B." data-uuid="d89d0ef6-d310-4f45-95cb-72c1c96da97c"><figcaption>The bench seat for the TM-B.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>The removable USB-C battery comes in two sizes: standard, which can power up to 60 miles of riding, and large, which maxes out at 100 miles of range.  When you’re not riding, the batteries can also be used as a large external battery pack.</p><p>In terms of power, the TM-B’s throttle tops out at 20MPH though the bike can reach speeds up to 28MPH with added  pedaling. Also is taking an interesting approach to its drive system, with a setup it&#39;s labeled &quot;DreamRide.&quot; Instead of a mechanical connection between the bike&#39;s rear wheel and the pedals, the TM-B uses &quot;software-defined pedaling,&quot; </p><p>In practice, this means that you pedaling is actually feeding the generator that powers the bike’s battery rather than directly pushing you forward. However, an Also rep told me that there is also a “limp mode” for when the bike runs out of juice so riders won’t get stranded. In those situations, pedaling will give the bike enough juice to hopefully get you to a spot where you can recharge.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/tmb_utility_.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/tmb_utility_.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="Also has envisioned the TM-B in a lot of scenarios, many of which involve hauling a lot of cargo." data-uuid="f7f8ee2b-fd3c-4576-87ac-61d38c1c8006"><figcaption>Also has envisioned the TM-B in a lot of scenarios, many of which involve hauling a lot of cargo.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Software-controlled pedaling probably won’t appeal to purists, but Also says it enables a much more customizable riding experience. When in auto mode, the bike will adapt to the speed you’re pedaling, though you can push on the throttle to get a boost. There’s also a manual mode that lets you select a “gear” (these are also software-controlled). </p><p>It also uses regenerative braking, so tapping on the brakes helps recharge the battery. Though in my short test ride I found that I didn’t need to use the brakes much, because when I stopped pedaling the bike slowed down pretty quickly, kind of like taking your foot off the accelerator in an EV.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/20250918_BrysonMalone_Also_2514.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/20250918_BrysonMalone_Also_2514.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The Also app and Portal display." data-uuid="71f37fbb-6ec3-4873-b4a7-6e7ddecde33a"><figcaption>The Also app and Portal display.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Also</div></figure><p>Given the bike&#39;s roots at Rivian, it&#39;s not surprising that there are also a bunch of other tech-enabled features, including a 5-inch touchscreen display, called &quot;Portal,&quot; that supports navigation, music playback and calling features via an accompanying app. There’s also a built-in security system that automatically locks the frame and rear wheel when you walk away.

The company has also signed licensing deals with companies like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-licensing-its-content-to-google-to-help-train-its-ai-models-200013007.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Google</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-strikes-deal-to-put-reddit-posts-in-chatgpt-224133045.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">OpenAI</a>, and even built an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-introduces-ai-powered-reddit-answers-search-feature-140028655.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI answer machine of its own</a> to leverage the knowledge in users&#39; posts. Scraping search results for Reddit content avoids those payments, which is why the company is seeking financial damages and a permanent injunction that prevents companies from selling previously scraped Reddit material.</p><p>Some of the companies Reddit is focused on, like SerApi, OxyLabs and AWMProxy, are not exactly household names, but they&#39;ve all made collecting data from search results and selling it a key part of their business. Perplexity&#39;s inclusion in the lawsuit might be more obvious. The AI company needs data to train its models, and has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-definition-of-copyright-gets-it-sued-by-the-dictionary-213408625.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">been caught</a> seemingly copying and regurgitating material it hasn&#39;t paid to license.

The company claimed it didn&#39;t use Reddit data, but it also continued to cite the platform in answers from its chatbot. Reddit says it was able to prove Perplexity was using scraped Reddit content by creating a &quot;test post&quot; that &quot;could only be crawled by Google’s search engine and was not otherwise accessible anywhere on the internet.&quot; Within a few hours, queries made to Perplexity&#39;s answer engine were able to reproduce the content of the post. </p><p>&quot;The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its &#39;answer engine&#39; is if it and/or its co-defendants scraped Google [search results] for that Reddit content and Perplexity then quickly incorporated that data into its answer engine,&quot; the lawsuit claims. </p><p>When asked to comment, Perplexity provided the following statement: </p><blockquote><p>Perplexity has not yet received the lawsuit, but we will always fight vigorously for users’ rights to freely and fairly access public knowledge. Our approach remains principled and responsible as we provide factual answers with accurate AI, and we will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.</p></blockquote><p>This new lawsuit fits with the aggressive stance Reddit has taken towards protecting its data, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-puts-ai-scrapers-on-notice-205734539.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">rate-limiting</a> unknown bots and web crawlers in 2024, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-is-restricting-its-availability-to-the-internet-archives-wayback-machine-170035482.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">even limiting</a> what access the Internet Archive&#39;s Wayback Machine has to its site in August 2025.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has removed dating apps Tea and TeaOnHer from the App Store for violating rules related to content moderation and user privacy. The company told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/apple-confirms-it-pulled-controversial-dating-apps-tea-and-teaonher-from-the-app-store/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em> </em>that it pulled the apps as they broke several of its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">rules</a>, including one mandating that apps can&#39;t share or otherwise use an individual&#39;s personal info without getting their permission first.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple said they also violated a rule concerning user-generated content, which stipulates that apps need to allow for reporting offensive or concerning material, an option to block abusive users and the ability to filter &quot;objectionable material from being posted.&quot;  In addition, Apple claimed the apps broke rules related to user reviews. It told <em>TechCrunch</em> they had an &quot;excessive&quot; volume of negative reviews and complaints from users, including ones related to minors’ personal details being shared. The company noted that it raised these issues&#39; with the apps&#39; developers, but they were not resolved.</p><p>As it stands, both apps are still available on Android through the Google Play Store. Tea (which is formally called Tea Dating Advice) enables women to post details about men they&#39;ve met or dated. It allows them to post and comment on photos, look up public records on individuals, carry out reverse image searches, share their experiences and rate or review men. Users can, for instance, say whether they&#39;d give a man a &quot;green flag&quot; or a &quot;red flag.&quot;</p><p>TeaOnHer flips that format on its head, with men sharing info about women. Both are pitched as dating safety apps, with Tea telling users they can &quot;ask our anonymous community of women to make sure your date is safe, not a catfish and not in a relationship.&quot;</p><p>Tea first emerged in 2023 and it went viral this year. In July, hackers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/data-breach-at-tea-reportedly-contains-images-and-dms-from-last-week-224823984.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">breached the app</a> and leaked tens of thousands of images, including around 3,000 selfies and photo IDs that users submitted to verify their accounts. The other images included posts, comments and private messages. A second hack exposed more than a million private messages.</p><p>Days after TeaOnHer went live in August (ripping off text from Tea’s App Store description in the process), it emerged that app <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/theres-a-tea-app-for-men-and-it-also-has-security-problems-224435459.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">had its own security issues</a>. It was possible to view photo IDs and selfies that users had submitted for account verification, as well as their email addresses.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-dumps-dating-apps-tea-and-teaonher-from-the-app-store-over-privacy-and-moderation-issues-191305457.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is adding a timer to Shorts to help curb all of that incessant doomscrolling, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/youtube-adds-at-timer-for-you-to-stop-scrolling-shorts/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. This feature is rolling out to all users after being spotted in an Android APK file earlier this year, which was originally <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-shorts-daily-timer-3543839/"><ins>reported on by </ins><em><ins>Android Authorit</ins></em><ins>y</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works. Users set a daily time limit for Shorts via the app&#39;s settings. Once reached, they&#39;ll see a pop-up reminding them to take a break. This pop-up is easily dismissed with a tap, but it&#39;s the thought that counts. At the very least, it&#39;ll remind people of just how long they&#39;ve been laying in bed and watching random <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> clips.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This doesn&#39;t currently integrate with parental controls, but that&#39;s coming next year. At that point, parents or guardians will be able to set specific time limits on how long kids can scroll the Shorts feed. That pop-up will not be dismissible by children.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the first move by YouTube to help improve digital well-being. There&#39;s a way to set &quot;take a break&quot; reminders at various increments, and the same goes for a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-bedtime-reminder-digital-wellness-160010856.html"><ins>pop-up at bedtime</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Why the renewed focus on limiting user engagement? Well, there are nearly 2,000 lawsuits floating around right now directed toward social media companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/new-york-city-sues-social-media-giants-over-addictive-features"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg Law</ins></em></a>. Many of these suits accuse the companies of intentionally designing their platforms to be addictive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/youtube-is-adding-a-timer-to-shorts-so-you-dont-scroll-the-day-away-185204383.html?src=rss]]></description>

Google believes its new algorithm is further proof of that assumption. The Quantum Echoes algorithm is able to illustrate how different parts of a quantum system interact with each other, in a way that&#39;s repeatable by other quantum computers and that &quot;runs 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;echo&quot; in Quantum Echoes comes from how Google&#39;s algorithm interacts with a quantum system, in this case the Willow chip. &quot;We send a carefully crafted signal into our quantum system (qubits on Willow chip), perturb one qubit, then precisely reverse the signal’s evolution to listen for the &#39;echo&#39; that comes back,&quot; the company explained in its announcement blog. That echo is magnified by the &quot;constructive interference&quot; of quantum waves, making the measurement Google is able to take extremely sensitive.</p><p>That sensitivity suggests quantum computers could be an important tool in modeling things like the interaction of particles or the structure of molecules. In a separate experiment with the University of California, Berkeley, Google tried to prove that by running the Quantum Echoes algorithm to study two different molecules, and comparing it to the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) method currently used by scientists to understand chemical structure. The results from both systems matched, and Google says Quantum Echoes even &quot;revealed information not usually available from NMR.&quot;</p><p>In the longterm, a full-scale quantum computer could be used for everything from drug discovery to the development of new battery components. For now though, Google believes its Quantum Echoes research means real-world quantum computer applications could arrive within the next five years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/google-says-it-made-a-breakthrough-toward-practical-quantum-computing-183502245.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Gemini <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2025/oct/1022-UM-GM-eyes-off-driving-conversational-AI-unified-software-platform.html">is coming to GM vehicles</a> in 2026. The company will be integrating a conversational AI assistant powered by Google&#39;s platform into many of its cars, trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>GM says this assistant will be able to access vehicle data to suss out maintenance concerns, alerting the driver when necessary. The company also promises it&#39;ll be able to help plan routes and explain various features of the car. It should also be able to do stuff like turn on the heat or air conditioning, even before entering the vehicle.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This will replace the &quot;Google built-in&quot; operating system that already exists in many GM vehicles. This OS already offers access to stuff like Google Maps, Google Assistant and related apps. The upcoming Gemini-based chat assistant will do the same type of things, but it should perform better.</p>
<p>“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if you’ve used the, you’ve probably also been frustrated by them because they’re trained on certain code words or they don’t understand accents very well or if you don’t say it quite right, you don’t get the right response,” GM VP <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/gm-is-bringing-google-gemini-powered-ai-assistant-to-cars-in-2026/">Dave Richardson told <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. “What’s great about large language models is they don’t seem to be affected by that.&quot;</p>
<p>One brand-new feature that Gemini will bring to the table is web integration. This will let drivers ask the chatbot questions pertaining to geographic location and the like. GM gives an example of someone asking about the history of a bridge they are passing over.</p>
<p>The Gemini assistant will be available via the Play Store after launch as an over-the-air upgrade to Onstar-equipped vehicles. It won&#39;t be limited to newer releases, as GM says it&#39;ll work with vehicles from the model year 2015 and above. The company also says it&#39;s working on its own AI chatbot that has been &quot;custom-built for your vehicle.&quot; There&#39;s no timetable on that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GM ran into hot water recently when it was found that it had been selling some customer information sourced from its OnStar Smart Driver program to insurance companies <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/ftc-bans-general-motors-from-selling-driver-data-for-five-years-000019615.html">without user consent</a>. This led to the FTC banning the company from selling any driver data for five years. Richardson says the Gemini integration will be privacy-focused and the software will let drivers control what information it can access and use.</p>

<p>The company made these announcements at the GM Forward media event, where it also discussed other forthcoming initiatives. It has scheduled a rollout of its self-driving platform for 2028. It&#39;s also developing its own computing platform, also launching in 2028. This does mean that GM will be <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/804562/gm-apple-carplay-android-auto-gas-cars-mary-barra">sunsetting integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto</a>. This software will be phased out over the next few years.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/google-gemini-will-arrive-in-gm-cars-starting-next-year-181249237.html?src=rss]]></description>

But while we strongly recommend using a VPN, it pays to do some research before investing in one — pricing can be opaque for these services, and you can't always trust how the providers portray their best deals. Even so, there are genuinely great deals to be had.</p>
<p>VPN providers love to give out deep discounts to anybody willing to sign up for a year or more at once. This means you've got to pay out more upfront, but if you divide the cost by the months of service, you're actually paying less per month over time. With deals like this, VPN providers boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

And now we also have a release date for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/marvel-cosmic-invasion-is-a-90s-style-beat-em-up-in-the-mold-of-shredders-revenge-191110625.html"><em><ins>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</ins></em></a>.</p>

<p>Out December 1 on practically every platform, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>lets you choose a team of two superheroes from a playable roster of 15, and you can switch character mid-fight. The new release date trailer rounds off the roster with the Invincible Iron Man (heard of him?) and Phoenix/Jean Grey (played by Jennifer Hale, who also voiced Jean in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-men-97-didnt-have-to-go-that-hard-140023964.html"><em><ins>X-Men ‘97</ins></em></a>), who join a list of previously announced characters that includes Spider-Man, Wolverine and Captain America.</p>
