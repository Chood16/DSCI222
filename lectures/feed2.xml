                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Republican-led FCC has voted on and approved a proposal that would make it harder for consumers to receive itemized bills with accurate information from their ISPs, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/fcc-votes-to-gut-broadband-nutrition-labels-heres-what-it-means-for-you/"><ins>as originally spotted by </ins><em><ins>CNET</ins></em></a>. This proposal revises previous &quot;unnecessary&quot; requirements on the grounds <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-fcc-is-trying-to-make-it-easier-for-internet-providers-to-charge-hidden-fees-155305720.html"><ins>that a fact-based list of charges</ins></a> &quot;may confuse customers.&quot;</p>
<p>These changes would minimize the benefit of the so-called &quot;nutrition labels&quot; which are otherwise known as Broadband Facts labels. You&#39;ve likely run into these simple itemized labels when shopping for a broadband plan. They tell consumers exactly what we are paying for, even if it may &quot;confuse&quot; our fragile little minds.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FCC passed a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on October 28 that would significantly scale back the Broadband Facts label. ISPs have been required to publish these labels since April, 2024. All Republican commission members voted to approve the change, while the lone Democrat dissented.</p>
<p>As previously noted, this is technically just an NPRM. So it&#39;s not a done deal just yet. There will be a final vote in the near future, but it&#39;s expected to pass given the political makeup of the commission.</p>
<p>Once passed, ISPs will no longer be required to read these labels over the phone to customers, make them available in account portals or give a complete accounting of fees to customers. The FCC previously stated that these transparency requirements are &quot;unduly burdensome and provide minimal benefit to consumers.&quot; I happen to think that knowing what I&#39;m shelling $100 out for each month to be of maximal benefit. Maybe that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>These labels were initially proposed all the way back in 2016, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-orders-isp-display-broadband-label-054900626.html">before being implemented by the Biden administration</a> in 2024. They offer a breakdown of every little thing that goes into a bill for a service plan, including many &quot;hidden fees&quot; that ISPs don&#39;t include in advertised plan prices.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the labels will technically still exist, they will just be harder to find and won&#39;t be all that useful. Raza Panjwani, senior policy counsel at New America’s Open Technology Institute, refers to this as a political &quot;two-step.&quot; He told <em>CNET</em> that the modus operandi here is to make the labels &quot;less useful&quot; and then say &quot;Oh, look, it&#39;s not that useful. We should get rid of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the commission, called the proposal &quot;one of the most anti-consumer items I have seen&quot; and expressed extreme displeasure with the results of the vote. “What adds insult to injury is that the FCC does not even explain why this proposal is necessary,” she said. “Make it make sense.”</p>
<p>Despite claims to the contrary by Brendan Carr and the current FCC, consumers actually like these labels. A 2024 study of nearly 5,000 broadband customers <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596124000144"><ins>found an 85 percent satisfaction rate</ins></a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, Americans pay a lot for internet service <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-costs-compared-worldwide"><ins>when compared to many other countries</ins></a> throughout the world. We pay around twice as much as customers in Europe and most of Asia.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trumps-fcc-is-officially-moving-to-make-it-easier-for-internet-companies-to-charge-hidden-fees-155004909.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Perplexity AI has agreed to a multi-year licensing partnership with Getty Images that will allow its users to access the latter’s extensive library of images. Leveraging Getty’s API, Perplexity will integrate the visual media distributor’s huge collection of stock and editorial imagery within its AI search and discovery tools, with correct attribution being a key part of the agreement.</p>
<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-and-perplexity-strike-multi-year-image-partnership"><ins>press release</ins></a>, Getty said that Perplexity will be &quot;making improvements on how it displays imagery, including image credit with link to source, to better educate users on how to use licensed imagery legally.&quot; As generative AI tools become more widely accessible, thorny issues around copyright and attribution have been the source of a number of lawsuits, no shortage of which have been targeted at Perplexity.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In August, the company was <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-sued-by-japanese-media-giants-for-stealing-information-and-presenting-false-information-133048116.html"><ins>sued</ins></a> by two Japanese media groups, <em>Nikkei </em>and <em>Asahi Shimbun</em>, for allegedly copying and storing article content from the pair’s servers illicitly, as well as crediting them with inaccurate information Perplexity supplied. It was also one of four companies sued by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-sues-perplexity-and-three-other-companies-for-allegedly-using-its-content-without-paying-205136436.html"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> earlier this month for allegedly using scraped data without the correct license. Even the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-definition-of-copyright-gets-it-sued-by-the-dictionary-213408625.html">dictionary</a> has taken the AI company to court.</p>
<p>Getty itself has bumped up against AI many times on the road to its new deal with Perplexity. Back in 2022 the company outright <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-ai-generated-content-ban-153337930.html"><ins>banned</ins></a> AI-generated art on its platform due the legal murkiness around copyright, and it later <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-sues-the-maker-of-ai-art-generator-stable-diffusion-over-data-scraping-allegations-184502897.html"><ins>sued</ins></a> the AI art tool Stable Diffusion over for allegedly copying and processing millions of protected images from its collection.</p>
<p>On the Perplexity agreement, Getty Images’ Vice President Strategic Development, Nick Unsworth, said that &quot;partnerships such as this support AI platforms to increase the quality and accuracy of information delivered to consumers, ultimately building a more engaging and reliable experience.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-signs-deal-to-use-getty-images-152343900.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most successful creators on Facebook aren't names you'd ever recognize. In fact, many of their pages don't have a face or recognizable persona attached. Instead, they run pages dedicated to memes, animal videos and yes, AI-generated photos and videos.</p><p>The people behind these pages are experts at creating content that can catch Facebook's algorithm and go viral. Successful pages can generate tens of thousands of dollars a month from performance bonuses, revenue-sharing and other monetization programs that pay Facebook creators for popular content.</p><p>For years, Meta fostered this industry of viral content on Facebook. As the company transformed Facebook's main feed into a "<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-app-redesign-tiktok-recommendations-221943589.html" data-i13n="slk:discovery engine;cpos:1;pos:1">discovery engine</a>" of recommended posts from random pages and accounts, creators supplied a stream of content crafted for the algorithm. But over the last year, some creators say this dynamic has broken down. Meta has penalized creators for the very same content it once rewarded. Other creators have seen Facebook's payment systems break down due to glitches and other errors.</p><p>One creator has become so frustrated, he's filed dozens of lawsuits in small claims court against Meta over the last year. Some of those lawsuits are related to missing payments and account issues he's experienced, but he's also brought 23 cases related to other creators' Facebook pages. As several of those cases are now winding their way through small claims court, he hopes his actions will bring attention to what he says is a wider breakdown in Meta's relationship with Facebook creators.</p><p>The cases shine a light on how Meta's lack of human-centered customer service can impact creators who rely on the platform. But it also offers a glimpse into the volatile dynamics of viral Facebook content.&nbsp;</p><p>Mel Bouzad is a former photojournalist for Getty Images who for the past eight years has made his living running popular Facebook pages with names like "The Meme Bros" and "FunkiestShitEver." He posts memes, travel content and AI-generated videos. Over the years, he's become an expert at figuring out what type of content is most likely to rack up views and comments on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's basically jumping on the trends as they're happening," he explains. "If you can jump on the trending topics right at the beginning, then you get the momentum, it kicks in the algorithm, and it sends your content viral. And if one post goes viral, the algorithm is going to send the next post viral, because it thinks the next post is going to get the same type of engagement." He's also learned little tricks for drawing more Facebook comments: adding a small error in a travel-focused listicle, or asking questions like "what's the most boring state in America?"</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bouzad_posts_.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bouzad_posts_.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="Example of recent posts from one of Bouzad's travel-themed pages on Facebook." data-uuid="879b29a6-95da-4c87-8122-398e6c5f5e49" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>Example of recent posts from one of Bouzad's travel-themed pages on Facebook.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>He estimates that at their peak, his pages collectively earned between $10,000 to $20,000 a month — primarily from performance bonuses and in-stream video ads — though they sometimes earned much more than that. Last September, 12 of his pages earned more than $68,0000 combined in performance bonuses, according to documents viewed by Engadget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But last year, five of his meme and travel pages were suddenly demonetized. The pages received a "monetization policy violation," a vague, catch-all term that can describe many supposed infractions. After some digging, he discovered they had been flagged for allegedly operating in a country ineligible for Meta's monetization programs. "To monetize, you must reside in an eligible country where the product or feature is available," a notice in the Facebook app said. "You may lose your ability to monetize if you move to an ineligible location or if Facebook changes product eligibility." Bouzad, who lives in the United States, assumed it was a misunderstanding and would be an easy fix.</p><p>But, like so many others, he quickly found that getting help from Meta was far from straightforward. "Despite 20+ support tickets and using paid support, I receive only automated replies," he later wrote in his first filing in small claims court last November.&nbsp;</p><p>Bouzad had heard of people using small claims court <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-small-claims-court-became-metas-customer-service-hotline-160224479.html" data-i13n="slk:to get Meta's attention;cpos:2;pos:1">to get Meta's attention</a> and decided to try it for himself. "I thought, I'm going to go in and sue for only one page … something small, just to get in the door [and] speak to somebody." At that point, Meta was withholding $2,498 in payments from the page called "Man Cave USA," according to court documents. He requested Meta pay the outstanding balance, along with $409 to cover court fees and interest.&nbsp;</p><p>His filing succeeded in getting a response from Meta. Bouzad said that about three weeks later he received a call from a law firm representing the social media company. After an extended back and forth, Meta eventually restored the page's ability to earn money. By February he officially dropped the case, telling the court that the company had "corrected the issue and remitted the payments owed."&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a939803a-b792-4576-836d-0de607a41f9b">Meta's conflicting explanations</h2><p>While he was dealing with that case, he tried to resolve the issues related to his other pages. Since he was still in mediation with Meta for his "Man Cave USA" page, he asked Meta's representatives if they could help with his other pages. He says that during a mediation session over Zoom, Meta's legal reps told him they wouldn't help with other pages unless they were tied to a lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>So in February he opened six new small claims court cases against the company. At the time, he said, Meta owed him more than $40,000 in unpaid invoices from accounts that had been wrongfully flagged; $15,000 of which were earnings from a single Facebook page. Because small claims court limits damages to $10,000 per case, he could only sue for a combined $35,000, but hoped that Meta would reinstate the payments if it were to re-examine his accounts.</p><p>In the meantime, Bouzad continued to try to resolve his account issues through Meta's official support channels and received confusing, and sometimes downright conflicting, information. In one email, Meta support told him he had been flagged for "<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=98fa5ea8-ed8b-4753-8c19-54288447e65d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;linkText=limited+originality+of+content&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaGVscC8zMzgyMzY2NjA4NjUwNDM3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OGZhNWVhOC1lZDhiLTQ3NTMtOGMxOS01NDI4ODQ0N2U2NWQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWxwLzMzODIzNjY2MDg2NTA0MzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATBBMN_t0Dh9zCqXJaqa95pkcLDv5nEBbWRGEa9thr8V&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F3382366608650437" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Portal from Facebook;elmt:;slk:limited originality of content;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/3382366608650437">limited originality of content</a>," but didn't explain. He also, again, received notifications saying that he was in a country that was "ineligible" for Meta's monetization programs.&nbsp;</p><p>In two separate chats with Meta Verified, the social network's paid <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-expanding-its-paid-verification-service-for-businesses-200412634.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc" data-i13n="slk:subscription service;cpos:4;pos:1">subscription service</a> for customer support, he was informed that he was ineligible because his page was linked to a bank account in Malta. The representatives then closed the chats without giving him an opportunity to respond, according to screenshots viewed by Engadget. Bouzad was getting more and more frustrated. "One, I've never been to Malta, two, my bank is Wells Fargo and three, I live in Oregon," he says.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-30_at_15.39.42.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-30_at_15.39.42.png" style="height:453px;width:669px;" alt="A chat with Meta Verified support in which Bouzad was told his accounts were demonetized because his bank was based in Malta.

Bouzad says he's only ever banked with Wells Fargo.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>He now sees his issues as part of a wider pattern from Meta. While the company had once provided him with a partner manager — a Facebook employee who could help sort out issues and provide advice — he hasn't had a dedicated contact at the company since 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>To him, the problem is twofold: Meta has become overly reliant on artificial intelligence for content moderation, which results in too many errors. At the same time, he claims Meta has largely outsourced the customer service it does offer — like through Meta Verified — and these workers aren't able to handle the types of issues he and other creators increasingly encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>Some creators who Bouzad has named in his lawsuits claim to have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in payments for what they describe as glitches in Meta's processes. Brent, a creator who asked to be identified by his first name only, was running a successful Facebook page that posts history-themed AI-generated videos. One recent clip features a group of supposed German prisoners-of-war walking through the snow, accompanied by a caption claiming that some POWs chose to immigrate to Canada following the war after experiencing "humane treatment" from their captors.&nbsp;</p><p>The page was doing well for a few months until April, when Meta asked Brent to verify his identity in order to keep receiving payments. His account had more than $11,000 in unpaid earnings at the time, according to documents reviewed by Engadget.&nbsp;</p><p>Several months later, Brent has been unable to complete this seemingly mundane step, despite repeatedly providing Meta a copy of his ID. Brent says that the issue stems from Meta mistakenly classifying his payout account as a "private corporation" rather than a "personal account." He says he has spent thousands of dollars on Meta Verified (the highest tier costs $500 a month) and has opened numerous support cases but has not been able to get the issue resolved.</p><p>Another creator is stuck after encountering a similar issue that prevented him from confirming the tax information associated with his payout account on Facebook. "My payout earnings were locked due to non editable 'greyed out' details when it came to entering tax information and other fields," the creator explained. "After about a year of trying to get support Meta finally came back with an archaic form to transfer the payout account to a new one associated with my page." But, after filling out the form for the transfer, Meta informed him that the more than $16,000 in unpaid earnings from his page were unable to be transferred to a new account.&nbsp;</p><p>The creator, who asked to remain anonymous, has spent more than a decade running music-related pages championing independent artists on the platform. "We're collectively sick of how Meta treats everyone, failing to provide adequate support, reasoning, reports and outcomes for content creators," he told Engadget. "There's little to no consistency or confidence in their ability to fairly reward creators." He's also battling stage 4 cancer, and says the missing funds have interfered with his treatment, and added to the stress he's already facing. His doctors recently informed him he likely has only a few months left to live; he's still hoping to recover the missing funds.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a9c454fb-f087-45fd-a010-edf14f49ad10">Gaps in support</h2><p>Social media is filled with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/meta-users-say-paying-for-verified-support-has-been-useless-in-the-face-of-mass-bans/" data-i13n="slk:numerous complaints;cpos:5;pos:1">numerous complaints</a> about the ineffectiveness of Facebook's support tools, including Meta Verified. Daniel Abas, the president and founder of the Creators Guild of America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for creators, says that demonetization is a "chronic issue" affecting creators on many platforms, including Meta's. "What's really difficult is not having consistency in terms of the enforcement and having policies that are opaque, having appeals processes that are inconsistent," he said.</p><p>Abas says that creators, especially high-earning ones, should have more resources to get support from companies like Meta. "Working with a web chat to get something resolved, or submitting an email to get something resolved, and not having that human touch is a major gap, and contributes to a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty when you're trying to build a company."</p><p>Meta has seemingly been changing some of the standards it has for creators on Facebook over the last year. The company in recent months began to crack down on creators sharing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-finally-acknowledges-that-facebook-has-a-major-spam-problem-175304372.html" data-i13n="slk:spammy;cpos:6;pos:1">spammy</a> and "low quality" content, though it only described a few specific examples of such activity, like pages that share posts with "long, distracting captions." The company does not prohibit creators from monetizing AI-generated content. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg recently said that Meta plans to add a "huge corpus" <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-add-a-huge-corpus-of-ai-content-into-its-recommendation-system-113027353.html" data-i13n="slk:of AI content;cpos:7;pos:1">of AI content</a> to its systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta declined to provide a comment for this story. The company maintains Bouzad has violated its policies, and has argued his court cases involving other Facebook users should be dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p>Bouzad insists that he has never intentionally violated Facebook's rules, and has grown frustrated with the company's changing explanations for why his pages have been demonetized. In an email with Meta Verified support, a customer service rep told him a recent violation for one of his travel pages was due to "Limited Originality of Contents," but didn't point to a specific post. During mediation, though, Meta's legal team claimed the same page had been generating views via "inauthentic engagement," according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Bouzad pushed back. "This wasn’t manipulation — it was performance-based exposure … we’re being punished for the very behavior the system rewarded," he wrote in an email to Meta's legal team.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-30_at_15.33.03.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-10-30_at_15.33.03.png" style="height:177px;width:661px;" alt="Bouzad says that Facebook consistently rewarded his posts with higher reach before it accused him of manipulating views." data-uuid="ed8a0c4f-edf6-4be6-8065-de8835bed0d5" data-display-size="standard"><figcaption>Bouzad says that Facebook consistently rewarded his posts with higher reach before it accused him of manipulating views.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>In documents reviewed by Engadget, Meta doesn't explain its allegation of inauthentic engagement. But the company did tell Bouzad it would be willing to pay him $5,000 — a fraction of what he claims to be owed — to settle the cases even though it was standing by its decision to demonetize his pages. Bouzad declined. He believes that Meta is unfairly targeting him and other creators who run high-earning Facebook pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Bouzad says he's heard countless stories from other creators who have also been hit with vague "monetization page violations" that have stalled their payments. Much like he experienced, these account flags don't describe the supposed infraction and don't give an opportunity for an appeal. This, he says, leaves creators with few options outside of the legal system.</p><h2 id="b1f87051-d2d2-4d78-ae3f-d8389495a8cb">An unusual legal maneuver&nbsp;</h2><p>After filing his second batch of small claims court cases in February, he began to reach out to his network and started filing more cases. Bouzad is not a lawyer and has no legal training; he's relied on ChatGPT and Gemini to guide his legal strategy. Much of that strategy relies on showing that other creators have allowed him to sue on their behalf through a process known as an assignment of claims. He filed 25 such cases in 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming a legal assignee is at best an unusual move for small claims court. Multiple legal experts contacted by Engadget said they had never heard of anyone doing so. "Normally, I don't think you see assigned claims in small claims [court]," Richard Slottee, a retired Oregon-based attorney, who has previously advised clients on small claims court cases. He said he was unsure of the legality of the move.&nbsp;</p><p>Marion County Circuit Court Judge Lindsay Partridge, who is presiding over Bouzad's small claims court case, seems similarly perplexed by the issue. In an October 23 hearing, he said that "there are some type of claims that under Oregon law, an anti-assignment clause would not be enforceable" but that he was unsure if the statute would apply in this particular case. "I tried to do a bunch of research on this," he said "I just can't find an answer to it."</p><p>Meta, on the other hand, has argued that its terms of service clearly prohibit users from transferring their rights to other parties without its consent. "Based on the No Transfer Clause, this Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment," a Meta project manager wrote in a letter to the judge. During the hearing, Judge Partridge said he was "concerned" that "what I have is essentially a very technical legal issue that's being presented by two non-attorneys." He said he would need "a little bit more time" to make a decision on whether Bouzad could move forward as an assignee.</p><p>The group Bouzad is helping consists mainly of colleagues, friends and friends-of-friends who had heard about his small claims cases. And though a few of the individuals are people he's partnered with in the past, he says he has no financial stake in the success of their pages. "It's power in numbers, we felt the more people, the more noise we could make, the better the chances of getting issues resolved," Bouzad says. "They gave me their cases to try and get that help [to] force Facebook to fix their pages." But there's also a potentially lucrative payday for him if he succeeds. As an assignee, he has the sole right to collect any judgment that ultimately comes out of the other creator's claims.&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><span class="quote">This Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment.</span><span class="attribution">A Meta project manager who is representing the company in small claims court</span></blockquote>For some of the creators involved, the amount at stake is far higher than what Bouzad has claimed in his flings. One UK-based creator who has assigned their claim to Bouzad runs a dog-themed Facebook page that generated more than $60,000 from in-stream video ads during a one-month period last year, according to documents seen by Engadget. Like Bouzad, their page was hit with an unexplained "MPV" violation that has affected their reach. "Due to its original content and niche audience, the Facebook algorithm regularly rewards it with high reach and frequent placement in the recommendation feed," Bouzad wrote in a small claims court filing that claimed $1,000 in damages. "This natural visibility has now been unfairly disabled by Meta."&nbsp;<p></p><p>Another creator, who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation from Meta, asked him to look into three of his Facebook pages, which collectively have more than 1.5 million followers. All three had been demonetized by Meta and, like Bouzad, the creator received conflicting explanations about why.&nbsp;</p><p>He was told two of the pages were flagged for "limited originality" even though he told Engadget he only posts videos that are scripted and filmed by him and his business partners. His pages are dedicated to scripted sketches filmed to look like real-life encounters. They often show people in seemingly mundane situations becoming inexplicably angry, with descriptions like "Teacher Karen Demands to Know Why I’m Picking Up My Kid," or "I Gave Candy to Kids and Apparently That’s 'Wrong' Now."</p><p>The third page was hit with a "monetization page violation" for residing in an "ineligible country," despite the fact that, according to the creator, it was managed from the United States and the EU, both of which are eligible to participate in Meta's programs. Engadget has also verified the page manager locations using Facebook's page transparency information.</p><p>Bouzad filed two small claims court cases related to these three pages. The two that had been flagged for limited originality eventually had their monetization restored and the case was dismissed.&nbsp;"I think Mel's helping immensely," he told Engadget. "The fact that he got us the two pages back helped us as a business a lot."&nbsp;</p><p>The second case, related to the page with the "MPV" flag, is still pending. The creator, who has worked with Bouzad in the past, says he's grateful for the legal help, but increasingly frustrated with Meta. The demonetized page was his highest-earning page, making between $3,000 - $5,000 a month from video ads on Facebook, according to documents filed as part of the small claims lawsuit. He doesn't understand why Meta continues to penalize it when the page posts similar content as his other accounts. "We've always been following the rules, because this is our business, it's how we pay the bills," he says. But, he says that Facebook's continued errors has made it "extremely difficult" to maintain a business as a creator.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="db655ce7-37bb-494b-ae06-439c5662baee">What's next&nbsp;</h2><p>Of the 32 cases Bouzad has filed, eight were resolved after Meta addressed the underlying issue. Nine cases were dismissed by Bouzad as the creators chose to pursue legal action in other states. Fifteen cases, including six related to Bouzad's own pages, are still open. In July, a judge consolidated Bouzad's remaining cases into a single claim, despite a motion from Bouzad to keep the cases separate. "The cases affected by this order involve identical parties, raise substantially similar claims, and collectively seek damages that exceed the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court," a judge wrote. Bouzad is currently seeking more than $115,0000 in damages, $35,000 of which are from his own pages, over unpaid invoices, filing fees and other expenses related to his months-long battle over Facebook's monetization practices.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Bouzad, the actual amount owed to him and the other creators is far higher. "Actual unpaid earnings exceed $220,000," he wrote in a filing, "but amounts have been capped in accordance with small claims jurisdictional limits."&nbsp;</p><p>For now, Bouzad's claims can't move forward until the judge rules on whether Bouzad can proceed as an assignee. If the judge decides in his favor, he will be able to make his arguments to the circuit court judge overseeing the case. If the judge rules in Meta's favor, he will only be able to move forward with the claims pertaining to his own Facebook pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Bouzad says he is prepared for the fight. He has painstakingly compiled more than 1,000 pages of court documents, screenshots and news clippings for his case. In his filing, he alleges Meta is in breach of contract over the missing payments. He says Meta has consistently flagged creators' accounts with vague "MPV" violations, made enforcement errors, delayed payments and ignored appeals. He acknowledges that his months-long legal battle, and his reduced earnings, have taken a toll on his personal life. "Taking on Facebook, it's not like you're suing a mom and pop shop," he says. "You're suing one of the largest businesses in the world, and it has caused a lot of stress."</p><p>His goal is still to get the monetization restrictions lifted from the Facebook pages and for Meta to resume its payments to him and the other creators. "I just want the pages fixed and the money paid that's owed," he said. He has hundreds of travel videos saved and ready to post on his Facebook pages if and when his monetization is restored.</p><p><em>Have a tip for Karissa?

And since it’s become more of a month-long affair than a one-day event, it’s a good time to pick up things for yourself and for other people while you can save some money in the process. But to say money is tight is an understatement this year. If Amazon’s<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.numerator.com/prime-big-deal-days/"> Prime Big Deal Days was any indicator</a>, folks are spending more on essentials than anything else right now.

I&#39;m actually not eyeing a new smartphone or laptop this holiday shopping season, but there are a few tech purchases I’d like to make if the prices are right. This is the tech I’m hoping to save on this year during Black Friday.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of our favorite <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">power banks</a> is on sale for one of the best prices we&#39;ve seen, period. The Anker MagGo Power Bank 10K has dropped to only $57, which is 37 percent off its usual price. To put it into perspective, the lowest we&#39;ve tracked it is $54, and that only happened briefly at the end of 2024. Today&#39;s sale applies to multiple colorways.</p> 
<p>This model topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">best power banks</a>, and with very good reason. It&#39;s a workhorse that gets the job done. It includes Qi2 tech for fast wireless charging and ships with a sturdy kickstand to prop up smartphones during use. The integrated LED display makes it easy to see the battery percentage, which is always nice.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The 10,000mAh battery should charge a modern iPhone nearly two times before requiring a trip to the outlet. For those not keen on wireless charging, there&#39;s a USB-C port.</p> 
<p>As for compatibility, this power bank has been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">optimized for Apple iPhones</a>. It&#39;ll work with Android handsets, but the wireless charging will be disabled. That&#39;s basically the only downside here.</p> 
<p>That&#39;s not the only Anker product on sale right now.

<p>The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it&#39;s technically just a 13-inch panel. There&#39;s support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.</p> 
<p>This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There&#39;s no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html">released the MacBook Pro M5</a>, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.</p>

Thanks to a deal with Reliance Intelligence, an AI-focused subsidiary of Reliance Industries, people signed up to Jio’s Unlimited 5G plan will be offered Google AI Pro at no extra cost for 18 months.</p>
<p>That means that qualifying users will have access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google’s most <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-expands-ai-mode-with-extra-features-for-search-205252812.html"><ins>advanced</ins></a> AI model. They will also benefit from higher limits for the Nano Banana and Veo 3.1 AI image and video generators, plus expanded access to NotebookLM. The plan also includes 2TB of cloud storage across Google’s apps, for a total combined worth of around 35,100 rupees ($396) per user.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The offer will initially be exclusive to Jio customers between the age of 18 and 25, but will eventually extend to all people on an eligible plan via the MyJio app. Jio is India&#39;s largest mobile network operator, and a company in which Google <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-investment-jio-india-101523701.html"><ins>purchased</ins></a> a 7.7 percent stake worth $4.5 million in 2020.</p>

One of those companies is Samsung, which is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/samsung-ai-factory">building a new AI factory</a> that will use 50,000 NVIDIA <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-shows-off-its-first-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-in-the-us-192836249.html">Blackwell</a> server GPUs and other NVIDIA technologies to make its own chips. This &quot;AI-driven semiconductor manufacturing,&quot; as the companies call it, will help Samsung improve its processes, better predict maintenance needs and improve the efficiency of its autonomous operations. NVIDIA will help Samsung adapt its chipmaking lithography platform to work with its GPUs, and it will apparently result in 20 times greater performance for Samsung.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Korean carmaker <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/hyundai-motor-group-ai-factory">Hyundai</a> will also use 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to develop its AI models for manufacturing and autonomous driving. Meanwhile, the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/sk-group-ai-factory">SK Group conglomerate</a>, which includes SK Telecom and DRAM and flash memory chip supplier SK Hynix, will use 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell server chips to launch an industrial AI cloud. The facility, NVIDIA says, will power the &quot;next generation of memory, robotics, digital twins and intelligent AI agents.&quot; As <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/nvidia-forges-ai-deals-with-south-korea-s-biggest-companies"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who&#39;s in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit, was recently photographed with Samsung&#39;s Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai’s Chung Euisun in a local restaurant.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally, NVIDIA is working with the South Korean government for its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/south-korea-ai-infrastructure">sovereign AI infrastructure</a>, or AI it will have control over. The Korean government will deploy 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs to the National AI Computing Center it&#39;s establishing, as well to facilities owned by local companies that include Kakao and Naver.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsung-is-using-nvidia-chips-to-build-its-new-ai-chip-factory-130057773.html?src=rss]]></description>

Best Buy&#39;s early Black Friday sale has the comfy cans for 45 percent off, knocking their price down to $199. That matches <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-bose-quietcomfort-headphones-are-still-on-sale-for-199-on-the-last-day-of-prime-day-103010111.html">their record low from Prime Day</a>.</p> 
<p>Bose&#39;s headphones have top-notch comfort and active noise cancellation (ANC). For the latter, you can choose between &quot;Quiet&quot; (full ANC) and &quot;Aware&quot; (hear your surroundings) modes. There&#39;s also a wind-blocking feature. The headphones&#39; audio, while not quite on par with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review-impactful-upgrades-to-a-familiar-formula-150000709.html">the $449 Ultra variant</a> (and missing spatial tricks), far surpasses what you&#39;ll typically find for $199.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="a7673e01ac2d4eafa93b7d19f4dd68dd" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/bose-quietcomfort-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-bluetooth-headphones-black/J7C5V6TLLS"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The company estimates 24 hours of battery life. It also supports quick charging: Plug in its USB-C cable and get up to 2.5 hours of charge in only 15 minutes.</p> 
<p>This model doesn&#39;t include an option to turn off ANC altogether, which some people may have appreciated. (That would have led to even more battery life, desirable for frequent travelers.) But if you&#39;re like me and always listen in ANC or aware modes, this is as solid a pick as you&#39;ll find for the sale price.</p> 
<p>Best Buy&#39;s Halloween weekend sale, dubbed &quot;DoorBOOsters&quot; (yes, really), is effectively a kickoff to the retailer&#39;s Black Friday sale season, with more deal events to follow in November.

<p>The Blink Mini 2 is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-security-camera-130035012.html">best budget security camera</a>. It&#39;s easy to set up and it integrates neatly into the Alexa smart home ecosystem. While you need a Blink Subscription for cloud storage ($3 for one camera, $10 for as many as you like), you can pick up a Sync Module 2 or Sync Module XR to store Blink Mini 2 footage locally. A Blink Subscription also enables specialized detection and alerts (e.g. for people and pets) and features like periodic photo captures.</p> 
<p>The Blink Mini 2 is weather resistant, though you&#39;ll need an adapter to use it outdoors. Additionally, you can use the Mini 2 as a plug-in chime that sounds when someone presses a Blink Video Doorbell.</p> 
<p>A number of other Blink cameras and bundles are on sale at the moment.

There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50.</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can&#39;t be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can&#39;t redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you&#39;ll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you&#39;ve set. There&#39;s also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what&#39;s been happening with your money that month. You&#39;ll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A good VPN is worth paying for. Almost every service I&#39;ll recommend as one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> is either subscription-only or supported by paid plans. Free VPNs do have their place, though, as not everybody can afford yet another subscription in the software-as-a-service hellscape we live in. Since everyone deserves privacy and flexibility online, I wanted to put together a definitive list of the best free VPNs.<br><br>Now, some will say that free VPNs are, by definition, security risks that are to be avoided by default. That reputation exists because <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html">free VPNs often really are a risk</a>. As proliferating age verification laws have created a need for VPNs, some free services have stepped up to answer the call, while others have <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/malware-apps-posing-as-free-vpns-are-on-the-rise-175629088.html">taken advantage of it to spread malware</a>. Free VPNs are easy for scammers to set up and hard for app stores to catch. I never recommend using one without doing thorough research.<br><br>To that end, the three providers on this list are exceptions to the risk of free VPNs. While they all have tradeoffs, they&#39;re also upfront about what they do and don&#39;t do. Each one comes with reliable security, a clean record of handling user data and apps that never force you to upgrade just so they&#39;ll work properly. They aren&#39;t the only good free VPNs, but they&#39;re the top three by far.<br><br><strong><em>Editor&#39;s note:</em></strong><em> This list represents our ranking as of October 2025. We intend to revisit the list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in features, testing results and other factors.</em></p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-free-vpns-we-tested">Other free VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The first three no-cost VPNs mentioned here are worthy of recommendation in their own ways, but didn&#39;t quite make the cut for our top picks. I&#39;ve left notes on them here in case one of them turns out to be perfect for you, and because they&#39;re on my list for induction into the free VPN pantheon if they improve.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>None of the above applies to Hotspot Shield, which you should not use. It&#39;s on here as a warning. You can find more details in that section below.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-privadovpn"><a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://privadovpn.com/">PrivadoVPN</a></h3> 
<p>PrivadoVPN is a strong enough contender that I seriously considered adding it to the list as my fourth official recommendation. It&#39;s technically unlimited, though once you use 10GB of data, it sharply handicaps your speed for the rest of the month. Free users can choose between 13 server locations on four continents. It even performs well on worldwide latency tests, though download speeds swing pretty heavily.</p> 
<p>That uncertain speed stat kept Privado out of the winner&#39;s circle, as did one other concern: although it has a clear and extensive privacy policy, it&#39;s never gone through a third-party audit. Additionally, it&#39;s a newer service, having only launched in 2019 — so it&#39;s harder to make claims about its business practices.</p> 
<p>Finally, while hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN all retain their excellence on the paid plan, PrivadoVPN isn&#39;t as worth paying for. Outside the free plan, it&#39;s a decent VPN with no reason to pick it over Proton or ExpressVPN. That said, if it passes an audit — or faces a real-world test of its no-logs policy, like a server seizure — look for Privado to join the big leagues soon.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=225c7513-c9e2-4f16-ab99-b55017ded469&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyNWM3NTEzLWM5ZTItNGYxNi1hYjk5LWI1NTAxN2RlZDQ2OSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd-QR8sCgzzEhM000cMDJ8mlAIx-uIz1QnlAaKygblRg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear does free VPN service well — it just doesn&#39;t do enough. Trust me, I don’t take pleasure in criticizing its adorable, hole-digging bear mascot, which goes a long way toward making the app welcoming to beginners. I like that its free plan offers access to the entire server network, the only VPN that does so.</p> 
<p>But the hard fact is that 2GB of data per month is not enough to do much of anything. With such a low data limit, TunnelBear&#39;s free plan is an enticement to upgrade to its paid service, not a viable VPN solution in its own right. That really is a good bear, though.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-eventvpn"><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.eventvpn.com/">EventVPN</a></h3> 
<p>EventVPN, developed by the ExpressVPN team, was launched <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/heres-how-eventvpn-is-different-from-other-free-vpns-213014671.html">a month ago</a> and could one day become an outstanding free VPN. However, given its bizarre decision to run ads in the app, I can&#39;t endorse it right now.</p> 
<p>Were EventVPN not associated with ExpressVPN or Kape Technologies, I might defend its decision to show ads by pointing out that all ad tracking data is anonymized — there isn&#39;t even a backend in which to store it. That might be a decent way to fund a full-featured free VPN. But EventVPN is openly part of a lucrative VPN portfolio, <em>and </em>has its own paid tier, so there&#39;s no excuse for the 30-second video ads.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-hotspot-shield-tested-and-not-recommended">Hotspot Shield: Tested and not recommended</h3> 
<p>Hotspot Shield was once the poster child for free VPNs; today, it&#39;s become one of the clearest illustrations of why they&#39;re dangerous. You get 500MB of browsing data per day, which is reasonable, on par with Windscribe&#39;s best offer. However, not only does the free version cap speeds at 2 Mbps, but it also restricts you to one location, the United States.</p> 
<p>Worse, it shows you ads. Unlike EventVPN, which at least limits itself to ads from a single service, Hotspot Shield lists no fewer than eight ad coordinators in its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hotspot Shield;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=45e2ebbb-df8a-4c86-85c9-ac19371103fa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=225c7513-c9e2-4f16-ab99-b55017ded469&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hotspot+Shield&amp;linkText=privacy+policy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3RzcG90c2hpZWxkLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5LXBvbGljeS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyNWM3NTEzLWM5ZTItNGYxNi1hYjk5LWI1NTAxN2RlZDQ2OSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG90c3BvdHNoaWVsZC5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS1wb2xpY3kvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeK-i2xVxnwj6OsADL6mwo4ch4g_AcgWRwuxdNoB-yQ2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hotspotshield.com%2Fprivacy-policy%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.hotspotshield.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>.

I can&#39;t name a better textbook example of &quot;if the product is free, you&#39;re the product.&quot;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-free-vpn">What to look for in a free VPN</h2> 
<p>Selecting a VPN is hard enough with all the competition out there, but with a free VPN, the stakes are even higher. Free VPNs are all over the place, and app stores don&#39;t vet them effectively. You&#39;re left on your own to determine whether a free VPN is mediocre, exploitative or even a straight-up malware vector.</p> 
<p>My top three recommendations — hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN — are clean. If you choose to use another one, here are the red flags to consider.</p> 
<p><strong>Security: </strong>First, make absolutely certain the free VPN isn&#39;t a threat to your security. Research it to see if any experts have warned against it, and check to make sure it uses known and approved encryption protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2 or an equivalent). If you have an antivirus program, download the VPN in sandbox mode so you can scan it while it&#39;s quarantined.</p> 
<p><strong>Privacy: </strong>Read the free VPN&#39;s privacy policy in detail to see if it claims any liberties with your personal data. As a rule, never use an &quot;ad-supported&quot; free VPN, since almost all ad services track users for targeted campaigns. Other free services, like Hola VPN, make money by selling user IP addresses as residential proxies. Be alert for any indication that the VPN will profit off your personal data.</p> 
<p><strong>Usage requirements: </strong>If you&#39;ve determined a free VPN is safe and secure, your next step is to make sure you&#39;ll be able to use it for the tasks you have in mind. Most reputable free VPNs are limited in some way. Match the restrictions to what you need; for example, if you want a free VPN for streaming, pick one without data caps that lets you choose your own server location.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Even if it meets the minimum requirements of safety and privacy, a free VPN still needs to meet the same criteria as any paid service. Mainly, it&#39;s got to be fast. With the free VPN active, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">run speed tests using Ookla</a> in several locations. On average, it shouldn&#39;t reduce your unprotected download speed by more than 25 percent.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer service: </strong>Some otherwise full-featured free VPNs skimp on customer service, restricting live help to paid users. Even Proton VPN is guilty of this. If you&#39;re a beginner or think you&#39;re going to need extra help, make sure to pick a free VPN with a well-written knowledgebase and available tech support.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-free-vpn-faqs">Free VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>Let&#39;s finish up with some of the free VPN questions we get most often. Leave a comment if you&#39;d like me to answer one I haven&#39;t gotten to yet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-free-vpn">What is a free VPN?</h3> 
<p>A free VPN is a virtual private network that&#39;s available to individual users at no cost. They generally take the form of desktop and mobile apps downloaded through websites or app stores. You can use them to filter your internet connection through another server, changing your virtual location and hiding what you do online.</p> 
<p>Most people use free VPNs to make it appear that they&#39;re getting online from somewhere else. This gets around restrictions on internet usage in certain jurisdictions, like China&#39;s &quot;Great Firewall&quot; or the UK&#39;s age verification laws. It can also be used to stream TV shows and events that aren&#39;t available in the user&#39;s home region.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-free-vpns-safe">Are free VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>While free VPNs aren&#39;t inherently dangerous, the use case and underlying business model makes them an easy vector for unscrupulous companies to take advantage of vulnerable users. It&#39;s easy for a malicious actor to set one up quickly and get it hosted on an app store. Likewise, the people who download free VPNs tend to need them urgently and may not look too closely at what they&#39;re putting on their phones or computers.</p> 
<p>As a rule of thumb, you should approach a free VPN with extreme caution. If it&#39;s not on our recommended list above, we&#39;d suggest avoiding it. In general, it&#39;s almost always safer to seek out VPNs that support their free versions with paid subscriptions, since they don&#39;t need to make money under the table. But any VPN – or other digital service – that&#39;s put forward as totally free puts us in mind of the old adage about gambling: If you can&#39;t spot the sucker at the table, it&#39;s probably you.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-best-free-vpn">What is the best free VPN?</h3> 
<p>I&#39;ve rated hide.me as the best free VPN. Its free service gives you a lot to work with — seven free locations and a data cap that doesn&#39;t really apply in practice. It&#39;s also just as secure and trustworthy as its paid version, without skimping on anything important.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-free-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a free VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Yes — in fact, there are more free VPNs on mobile app stores than almost anywhere else. All three of my top picks (hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN) have apps for both iOS and Android, and nearly every other free VPN works on at least one mobile platform.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Disney&#39;s channels have gone dark on YouTube TV after the companies failed to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-warns-that-youtube-tv-could-lose-its-channels-amid-fee-negotations-155347776.html">reach an agreement</a> by their October 30 deadline. The affected channels include ESPN, local ABC stations, ABC News, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. &quot;Last week Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/?sjid=11269581620476450138-NA"><em>YouTube</em></a> said in an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/?sjid=11269581620476450138-NA">announcement on its blog</a>. &quot;They’re now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV.&quot; YouTube added that Disney&#39;s decision harms its subscribers while benefiting its own live TV products, such as Hulu+Live TV and Fubo.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-10-30/espn-abc-disney-blackout-youtube-tv-contract-dispute"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, however, Disney accused Google&#39;s YouTube TV of choosing to deny &quot;subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for [its] channels, including ESPN and ABC.&quot; Disney also accused Google of using its market dominance to &quot;eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms&quot; that other pay-TV distributors have agreed to pay for its content. YouTube TV lost access to Disney channels back in 2021, but they were immediately able to strike a deal that <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-disney-channels-back-espn-abc-213518747.html">restored the channels</a> the very next day. The companies are most likely still trying to negotiate at the moment, but Google says it will offer subscribers a $20 credit if Disney channels remain offline for an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google has had to make several similar announcements over the past year. In February, YouTube TV <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-has-reached-a-deal-with-paramount-to-keep-carrying-cbs-cbs-sports-and-other-channels-154245757.html">almost lost Paramount content</a>, including CBS, CBS Sports and Nickelodeon, before reaching a last-minute deal. The same thing happened in August <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-subscribers-wont-lose-access-to-fox-content-after-all-130054330.html">with Fox</a>. More recently, Google and NBCUniversal also <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-and-nbcuniversal-reach-multi-year-agreement-for-youtube-tv-120051505.html">came to an agreement</a> at the eleventh hour, though YouTube TV <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-keeps-nbc-with-a-last-minute-extension-but-loses-univision-121508916.html">lost access to Univision</a>, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the US.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft’s latest earnings report for the quarter ending on September 30 revealed that revenue from the Xbox hardware <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-console-revenue-fell-30-percent-year-over-year-this-summer-012245146.html">fell 30 percent</a> year over year.</p>
<p>Worse, in a way, this revenue decline doesn’t reflect any dip in sales caused by the console’s $20 to $70 price hike, since that took effect on October 3 — after this earnings report. (Oh, and Microsoft raised the price for its Game Pass Ultimate subscription from $20 to $30 in October.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, revenue from Xbox content and services, specifically, remained relatively unchanged from the same period last year. That’s the Game Pass component of Microsoft’s gaming business.</p>
<p>When Microsoft started cutting down its global workforce earlier this year, Xbox was hit hard, with the company canceling games, like a modern reimagining of <em>Perfect Dark</em>, and even shutting the Xbox studio working on it.</p>
<p>More broadly, Microsoft’s revenue is up, with CEO Satya Nadella posting a few highlights about the company’s earnings call on X, which mostly focused on AI. He said the company will increase its AI capacity by 80 percent this year.</p>

<p>Just in time for your Halloween nightmares, here comes Neo. From California-based AI and robotics company 1X, it’s designed to deal with everyday chores and tasks.</p>
<p>But not out of the box. At launch, it’ll be able to open doors, fetch items and turn lights on and off. More complicated tasks will require a human teleoperator to control the robot remotely, training the Neo to repeat the task. Horror movie premise? Tick.</p>
<p>1X CEO Bernt Børnich explained that the AI neural network inside the Neo has to learn from more real-world experiences. To do so, buyers will have to agree to a human operator seeing their houses through the robot’s camera, judging their cleanliness levels and interior decor decisions. (Probably.)</p>

<p>Three and a half years since season four of <em>Stranger Things</em> premiered, we get a true trailer for the fifth and final season. As Lawrence Bonk notes, it appears that the conclusion of the series will be an action-packed affair, heavy on emotion and light on the type of ’80s humor the show became known for. Poor Will, he’s getting some of the worst of it, again.</p>

<p>Halloween is almost over, so it’s time to assess the entire year, buy holiday presents and generally pretend there aren’t two whole months before the end of 2025. So we have compiled a list of the best gear we reviewed this year based on the highest review scores in each category. From Pixel to iPad and Switch 2 to Sony WH-1000XM6, our reviews team has spent thousands of hours testing new products this year to discover the best of the best. These are those! I ended up buying five of them — is that enough to keep my job?</p>

<p>If you’re a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative. Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers, but it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs the complexity. If you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. Some caveats, though: The discount is only for new users, and you can’t combine it with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Projectors have come a long way from bulky, noisy boxes that only belonged in a dedicated home theater. Today’s models are brighter, sharper and more flexible, making them a practical upgrade for movie nights, gaming sessions or backyard screenings. Whether you want a compact projector that fits in a backpack or a full 4K setup for your living room, there’s something to match nearly every space and budget.<br><br>Modern projectors handle far more than films. Some are tuned for low-latency gaming, others run built-in streaming apps and many can mirror your phone or laptop without extra cables. Improvements in LED and laser lighting mean better color accuracy and higher brightness, even in rooms that aren’t completely dark. Combine that with lighter designs and quieter cooling, and it’s easy to see why a projector can replace or complement a traditional TV.<br><br>We’ve tested projectors across categories and price ranges to help you find the right one, whether you’re aiming for a portable option to take on the go or a cinematic display that turns any wall into a screen.</p>

<p>Some projectors are for serious cinephiles, projecting sharp 4K video with HDR brightness and hyper realistic colors to a large screen. Others are bright enough to replace your TV for sports or gaming, and some low-cost portable models can be set up for camping or outdoor fun. That’s why we’ve divided this guide into several categories to help you find the right one.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For a deep dive on projector technology check my <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-the-best-projector-in-2019.html">previous explainer</a>, but there are few key things to keep in mind. What will the projector mainly be used for? What type of room will it be used in? And how big of an image do you want? You’ll also see a variety of specifications that may be confusing, so here are a few to consider and what they mean.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-brightness-and-contrast">Brightness and contrast</h3> 
<p>Brightness is measured in ANSI lumens; the brighter the projector, typically the more expensive it will be. 1,500-2,500 lumens is good for darkened rooms, 3,000-4,000 lumens allows you to see with some ambient light and 4,000+ lumens is bright enough to use in direct sunlight. High contrast is important, because projectors are more sensitive to things like ambient light and reflections.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dlp-vs-lcd">DLP vs LCD</h3> 
<p>Digital light processing units (DLPs) used by Optoma, BenQ, LG and others allow bright 4K images. The negative is that they can produce a “rainbow” effect, or red/blue/green artifacts that affect some viewers more than others. LCDs are used mainly by Epson, but also Sony and Sanyo. Those are often brighter, more color accurate and don’t produce rainbow effects, but are also more expensive and susceptible to image degradation over time.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-resolution">Resolution</h3> 
<p>If you want a true 4K projector, beware: only expensive models have native 4K resolution (many movie theaters still use <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.screendaily.com/features/the-resolution-war-is-cinema-falling-behind-home-entertainment-on-innovation/5124023.article">2K projectors</a> for <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-19-upscaled-uhd-4k-digital-intermediate-explainer.html">various reasons</a>). However, most DLP projectors and some LCD models can use pixel-shifting to attain 4K resolution.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-hdr-and-color-accuracy">HDR and color accuracy</h3> 
<p>Projectors can’t produce anywhere close to the amount of light required to qualify as true HDR. Rather, they use a technique called <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.projectorreviews.com/terms/tone-mapping/">tone mapping</a> to fit the entire HDR gamut into a lower brightness range. That said, many projectors can display millions of colors, with some models surpassing the color accuracy of TVs and monitors.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ust-vs-classic">UST vs. classic</h3> 
<p>Classic projectors and screens can be mounted on the ceiling so they’re great if you have no floor space. They can also project a larger video for a truly cinematic experience. UST projectors mount on the floor right next to the screen so they can take the place of a TV. They don’t beam as big an image but are generally brighter, sharper and more expensive. For best results, they require special screens.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mounting-and-fan-noise">Mounting and fan noise</h3> 
<p>Ceiling mounting requires some work and don’t forget to budget for a bracket and any necessary long cables, including extra power for a Google Chromecast or other streaming device. UST projectors require less labor, but getting the image perfectly square can still be surprisingly time-consuming. As for fan noise, some projectors (usually cheaper DLP models) generate more than others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-optics">Optics</h3> 
<p>For more flexibility with location and image size, ceiling mounted projectors need a good zoom range. Lens shift, meanwhile, is used if the projector is mounted higher or lower relative to the screen than recommended by the manufacturer. Otherwise, you might have to use a &quot;keystone correction&quot; to digitally stretch part of the image, resulting in distortion or artifacts. Also, keystore correction may not work in gaming modes for some models.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-gaming-and-streaming">Gaming and streaming</h3> 
<p>If you’re interested in a projector for gaming, look up the refresh rate and input lag figures. Some projectors offer good numbers in that regard (240Hz and &lt;20 ms, respectively), but others designed for home entertainment have very poor input lag and refresh rates at just 60 Hz. If it’s streaming you want, be sure to pick a model either with built-in Google TV or a bundled streaming dongle.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-screens">Screens</h3> 
<p>Should you project onto a wall, roll-down screen, fixed screen or ambient light rejecting (ALR) screen? The choice depends largely on the room and what kind of projector you have. Roll down screens take up no space as they’re ceiling mounted, fixed screens can be moved easily and ALR models are perfect in rooms with a lot of ambient light.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-projector-faqs">Best projector FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-4k-projectors-better">Are 4K projectors better?</h3> 
<p>Yes, because higher resolution is more noticeable on larger screens, so 4K is particularly useful with projectors since they beam images up to 200 inches in size. That being said, brightness and contrast are more important.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-a-projector-better-than-a-tv">Is a projector better than a TV?</h3> 
<p>Projectors can provide a more immersive experience thanks to the large screen, but they’re not necessarily “better.” Since you usually have to dim the lights with a projector, TVs are superior for everyday use.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-2000-lumens-bright-enough-for-a-projector">Is 2000 lumens bright enough for a projector?</h3> 
<p>Yes, 2000 lumens is easily bright enough, even with some ambient light in the room. However, the image will still be hard to see with the windows open on a bright day.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-should-i-get-a-4k-or-1080p-projector">Should I get a 4K or 1080p projector?</h3> 
<p>That depends on your budget and needs. If your budget is below $1,000, look for a 1080p projector with the best brightness and contrast. Between $1,000-$2,000, you’ll need to weigh whether brightness or 4K resolution is most important. Above that, choose the brightest 4K projector you can afford.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-projectors-in-daylight">What are the best projectors in daylight?</h3> 
<p>The best projectors in daylight are ultra short throw (UST) models, as they have the brightest and sharpest image. However, they generally cost more than $2,000.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-you-need-a-screen-for-a-better-projector-experience">Do you need a screen for a better projector experience?</h3> 
<p>Technically, you don’t need a screen to use a projector — any light-colored, smooth wall can work in a pinch. But if you want to get the most out of your projector, a screen can make a difference. Projector screens are designed to reflect light evenly and enhance contrast, so colors look more vibrant and the picture appears sharper. With a screen, you’ll notice darker blacks and brighter colors, which can give a real boost to your movie nights or gaming sessions. So while you can absolutely enjoy a projector without one, a screen can make the experience feel a bit more like your own personal theater.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-should-i-buy-a-portable-or-home-projector">Should I buy a portable or home projector?</h3> 
<p>It depends on how and where you plan to use it. If you want a projector you can easily move around, bring to friends’ houses or set up indoors or outdoors easily, a portable projector is a great choice. They’re usually smaller, lightweight and often have built-in speakers and batteries, making them convenient for on-the-go use.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, if you’re looking for a more permanent setup for a home theater or living room, a home projector might be the way to go. Home projectors tend to be more powerful, with higher resolution and brightness, which gives you that crisp, cinema-quality experience. They’re ideal if you have a dedicated space and don’t mind leaving it set up in one spot.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/best-projectors-123004354.html?src=rss]]></description>

Or, at least, freemium.</p><p>Affinity is available now as a desktop app for macOS and Windows, with an iPadOS version on the way at some point in the future. The basic functionality of the app doesn&#39;t seem all that different from the three separate apps Serif offered before, only now you can toggle between their tools via separate Vector, Pixel and Layout tabs. Canva stresses you also have the option to mix and match tools, and save custom toolbars to use for specific types of projects, if you want.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xy2ajS-qpdM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Beyond layering in chunky serif fonts, Canva&#39;s touch seems relatively light. The Affinity app now requires a free Canva account to use and offers integrations with the company&#39;s suite of tools, with a new option to send an Affinity project directly to Canva. The company is also making its Canva AI Studio tools available in Affinity, giving users the ability to automatically remove a background or use Generative Fill to edit part of a photo. How well veteran Affinity users will take to these changes remains to be seen, but they&#39;ll at least be able to continue using their existing copies of the old <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/affinity-version-2-suite-150051754.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Affinity V2 lineup</a>.</p><p>Free sounds good, but one of the draws of the original Affinity creative suite is that you could purchase a license for Serif&#39;s individual apps and not ever have to think about it again. Canva is promising that the new Affinity will be free going forward, but a free app that requires an account and might try to upsell you on subscription-based AI features is not quite the same thing.</p><p>Affinity wasn&#39;t the only Adobe competitor to be acquired in 2024. Pixelmator, a developer of popular photo and image editing tools for iOS, iPadOS and macOS, was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-is-buying-the-developer-of-one-of-the-iphones-best-photo-editing-apps-165853866.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">absorbed by Apple</a> in November that same year. The company&#39;s apps continue to be maintained, but it’s still not clear if Apple plans to shift them to a subscription model in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/affinity-resurfaces-as-an-all-in-one-illustration-photo-editing-and-layout-app-204833289.html?src=rss]]></description>

Traveling at supersonic speeds, faster than Mach 1 or around 768 miles per hour, could dramatically shorten trips transporting people and cargo. And if the Quesst design NASA and Lockheed Martin have come up with works, which includes tweaks like placing the jet engine on top of the plane and using an extremely pointy nose, it should also be much quieter. &quot;People below would hear sonic &#39;thumps&#39; rather than booms, if they hear anything at all,&quot; NASA explained in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasas-quesst-reassessing-a-50-year-supersonic-speed-limit/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a 2023 blog post</a>.</p><p>A <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/28/archives/supersonic-civilianflights-over-us-are-outlawed.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">ban on supersonic flights</a> over the United States went into effect on April 27, 1973, in response to concerns of property damage and noise pollution.

They aren't really meant to be everyday sunglasses (unless you're really committed to your athletic pursuits) but they are in many ways more capable than Meta's other smart glasses. The speakers are louder, the camera has new abilities and they integrate directly with Strava and Garmin. And while these won't replace my go-to sunglasses, there's more than enough to make them part of my fitness routine.</p><p><core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="4e9e3b55-ff79-4116-a841-078a1c8a0778" data-original-url="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses/"></core-commerce></p><h2 id="0d99edbc-259b-4f83-b05f-759e82284144">New look, new setup</h2><p>The sunglasses were very clearly made with athletes in mind. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are the type of shades a lot of people probably think of when they hear "Oakley sunglasses." The wraparound frames with colorful, reflective lenses are the style of glasses you might associate with a high school track coach, or your neighbor who is <em>really</em> serious about cycling.</p><p>The pair I tested had black frames and Oakley's orange "Prizm 24K" lenses, which aren't polarized but are favored by a lot of athletes for their ability to dial up the contrast of your surroundings. I was able to comfortably wear my pair in bright, sunny conditions and also in more overcast lower light. I also appreciate that the lenses are swappable, so you can switch them out for a dedicated low-light or different-colored lens depending on your conditions.

These glasses don't, however, support prescription lenses of any kind.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/kb_vanguard.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/kb_vanguard.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="I wouldn't wear these as everyday sunglasses, but I don't mind the look for a trail run." data-uuid="c816e143-a602-4c85-b0b4-c7f78427a4e5"><figcaption>I wouldn't wear these as everyday sunglasses, but I don't mind the look for a trail run.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>I realize this style of sunglasses won't be appealing to everyone, but the frame shape does enable a slightly different setup than what we've seen with any of Meta's other smart glasses. Most noticeably, the camera is in the center of the glasses, just above the nosebridge. The LED that lights up when the camera is on is also in the center, near the top of the frames.&nbsp;</p><p>As with Meta's other smart glasses, you can control volume and music playback via a touchpad on the right side of the glasses, but the capture button to take photos and videos is now on the underside of the glasses rather than on top. This is meant to make it a bit easier to reach if you're wearing a hat or helmet, though I found it took me a few tries to get used to the new placement. Behind the capture button is the previously mentioned "action button," which can be customized to trigger specific functions via the Meta AI app.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oakley_meta_vanguard_capture_and_action.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oakley_meta_vanguard_capture_and_action.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The capture button (left) and the action button (right) are both on the underside of the frames rather than on top." data-uuid="68283ab9-2559-4778-85b8-1980edf4f348"><figcaption>The capture button (left) and the action button (right) are both on the underside of the frames rather than on top.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>I haven't yet figured out what the best use for the action button is, though I've tried out a few different setups. On one hike, I set it up to automatically call my husband, kind of like a speed dial. During a bike ride, I had it set to record a hyperlapse video. I've also tried it out as a shortcut for launching a specific Spotify playlist or as a general trigger for Meta AI. With all of these, I appreciated that the action button allowed me to do something without saying the "Hey Meta," command. Repeating "hey Meta" to my glasses in public has always felt a bit cringey, so it was nice to have a much more subtle cue available.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="0e681b30-24a7-4d59-bd41-0564188aa685">Did I mention it's for athletes?</h2><p>The Vanguard's athlete-focused features go beyond the sportier frames. The shades come with new integrations for two of the most popular run and bike-tracking platforms: Garmin and Strava. If you have a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apps.garmin.com/apps/e9044ba2-20b0-40a4-9d8e-3e13193b6f5f?tid=1" data-i13n="slk:supported Garmin;cpos:5;pos:1">supported Garmin</a> watch or bike computer, you can set up the glasses to automatically capture video clips based on metrics from your activity, like hitting a particular heart rate zone or other milestone. You can also ask Meta AI directly to tell you about stats from your Garmin watch, like "hey Meta, what's my pace."&nbsp;</p><p>I don't have a Garmin watch, though I did briefly test out some of these features during my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-are-the-smart-glasses-athletes-might-actually-want-001511094.html" data-i13n="slk:hands-on;cpos:6;pos:1">hands-on</a> at Meta Connect. I suspect a lot of runners and cyclists may still find it easier to simply glance at their watch to see stats, but having it all available via voice commands doesn't seem like a bad thing either.</p><p>Strava's integration isn't quite as deep. If you're tracking a run, hike or ride while wearing the glasses, you can overlay your stats directly onto photos and videos from your activity. This includes metrics like distance and elevation, as well as heart rate if you're also wearing an Apple Watch or other tracker that's connected to the Strava app. Here's what it looks like with a photo from a recent bike ride.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/F77D238C-68B8-4224-ACA9-62DE07C9B49B.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/F77D238C-68B8-4224-ACA9-62DE07C9B49B.jpg" style="height:4028px;width:2875px;" alt="You can overlay your Strava stats onto the photos and videos you record." data-uuid="303dc218-b745-4196-9a8e-5c7744030257"><figcaption>You can overlay your Strava stats onto the photos and videos you record.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>I typically don’t share stats from runs or bike rides (usually because they aren't that impressive) but it's a bit more appealing that just sharing a straight Strava screenshot. Another neat feature is that if you share a video, you can watch the stats change in real time alongside your recording. That level of detail isn't particularly interesting for a mostly flat bike ride on a city street, but I can see how it would be a lot more compelling on a more technical trail ride or in a race.&nbsp;</p><p>My only complaint, really, is that Meta has limited these kinds of features to Garmin and Strava's platforms so far. I'd love to have support for my favorite ski-tracking app, Slopes, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd be happy to have an integration with their running or workout-tracking app of choice. Meta has announced some plans to bring more <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html" data-i13n="slk:third-party apps;cpos:7;pos:1">third-party apps</a> onto its smart glasses platform so there might be hope here.&nbsp;</p><p>There are other improvements, though, that will be appealing to even casual athletes. The speakers are a lot louder to account for potentially noisy conditions like a congested roadway or high-wind environment. I never had to crank the volume up anywhere near the max during my bike rides or runs, but I can say the speakers were loud and clear enough that I was able to comfortably listen to a podcast with the glasses laying next to me on the couch at full volume.</p><p>The new centered camera placement is meant to make it harder for a hat or helmet to interfere with your shots, which has been a consistent issue for me with Meta's other smart glasses. The new position didn't totally solve this — I still found that my bike helmet made it into the top of my pics — but at least it's easier to crop out now that my headgear is centered over the top of my image rather than awkwardly sticking out on one side.</p><p>The 12MP ultra-wide camera also comes with new video stabilization settings that make it feel a bit more like a replacement for an action cam. The glasses are set to automatically select a level of stabilization based on your motion, but you can also manually choose between low, medium or high stabilization (stabilization is locked at "medium" if you opt to record in 3K). I've mostly left it with the default settings and have been impressed with the results.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oakley_vanguard_light_top.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oakley_vanguard_light_top.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The LED light is also a bit more subtle than on Meta's other smart glasses." data-uuid="fc0f2c82-d31b-4633-8fc7-5ef4c72c8ee4"><figcaption>The LED light is also a bit more subtle than on Meta's other smart glasses.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Vanguard glasses are also Meta's first smart glasses that can record hyperlapse and slow-motion video. Hyperlapse should be familiar to Instagram users who used the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-removes-boomerang-hyperlapse-apps-213909811.html" data-i13n="slk:now-defunct;cpos:8;pos:1">now-defunct</a> app of the same name to record timelapse clips. Now, you can say "Hey Meta, start a hyperlapse" and the glasses will record a similar sped-up clip. My hyperlapse clips ended up looking a bit jittery, though, compared to the timelapse shots I'm used to getting with my GoPro.&nbsp; And unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the cadence of the video like you used to be able to with the dedicated app.&nbsp;</p><p>My slow-motion clips, on the other hand, came out better. It's not something I'd expect to use very often during a bike ride or trail run, but the POV angle is great for recording clips of pets or kids. Meta is also planning to bring support for hyperlapse and slow-motion videos to the rest of its glasses lineup, though, so you don't need to get these particular shades to take advantage of the feature.</p><p>The other major improvement is battery life. The Vanguard glasses have a notably better battery life compared with the second-gen Ray-Ban glasses or the HSTN frames (probably because the bigger frames allow for a larger battery). According to Meta, the Vanguard glasses can go nine hours on a charge with "typical use" or six hours with continuous audio playback. I was actually able to get a little over six hours of audio on a single charge, so they should hold up pretty well if you're running marathons or competing in longer races. As usual, exact battery life can vary a lot depending on how much you're using more resource-intensive features like video recording or Meta AI.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oakley_meta_vanguard_back_.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/oakley_meta_vanguard_back_.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The bigger frames and charging case give the glasses a battery life boost. " data-uuid="9a4a7c2e-d91c-4a0d-a663-980e951ef671"><figcaption>The bigger frames and charging case give the glasses a battery life boost. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>I'm especially looking forward to seeing how these glasses will hold up during a day of snowboarding. Meta previously told me that the battery has been optimized for a wider spectrum of temperatures so hopefully the battery won't drain as quickly on the mountain as Meta's other glasses. And with increased water resistance — the shades have an IP67 rating —&nbsp; I wouldn't worry about dropping them in the snow.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="20480e3a-3ebd-4b1b-af95-6b23708c589f">Should you buy these?</h2><p>While Meta and EssilorLuxottica have gotten very good at making smart glasses (sorry Mark Zuckerberg, I won't call them "AI glasses,") they are still somewhat of a niche product. And the ultra-sporty Oakley Vanguard glasses are even more niche. At $499, these are also more expensive than other models.</p><p>That, understandably, may feel too steep for a pair of sunglasses you're likely only going to wear during specific activities. But if you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like. The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share. Ready-made Garmin and Strava integrations are practically begging for you to brag about your latest PR or race time, which will certainly appeal to many.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much like <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>, Thief&#39;s long-awaited return is a VR exclusive. The game was announced in June, but now we <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/thief-vr-quest-gameplay-release-date/">know</a> when it will arrive. You can play the pioneering stealth franchise&#39;s new chapter, <em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</em>, on December 4.</p>
<p><em>Thief VR</em> takes place about halfway between the events of the original trilogy and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-24-thief-review-for-the-hoard.html"><em>Thief</em> (2014)</a>. You play as Magpie, a cunning thief (duh), who discovers a legendary eye artifact with a mysterious connection to the past. You&#39;re operating in a city that&#39;s under the grip of Baron Ulysses Northcrest, &quot;a tyrant who crushes rebellion before it can take root.&quot; That all sounds like an ideal backdrop for sneaking around and stealing shit.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Publisher Vertigo Games offered a glimpse at Meta Quest gameplay, which you can watch below. <em>Thief VR</em> will also be available on PS VR and SteamVR when it arrives on December 4. The title has a $30 list price on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/">Steam</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/">Meta</a>, but can be pre-ordered now for $27. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010853/">PlayStation Store</a> version doesn&#39;t yet have pricing or reservation info.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/call-of-duty-is-getting-the-movie-treatment-courtesy-of-paramount-171408410.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">learned</a> last month that Call of Duty would be making the leap to the big screen with a planned motion picture project. Today, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reported that two of the main creative forces behind the movie will be Taylor Sheridan and Peter Berg.&nbsp;</p><p>Sheridan and Berg previously both worked on the 2016 film <em>Hell or High Water</em> and 2017&#39;s <em>Wind River</em>. Berg was a producer on those projects, but he&#39;s perhaps better known as a writer for the football drama <em>Friday Night Lights</em>. Sheridan&#39;s most recent endeavor was TV series <em>Yellowstone</em>, and he also worked on <em>Lioness</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em> and <em>Tulsa King</em>. For Paramount&#39;s <em>Call of Duty</em> adaptation, both will produce and co-write, while Berg is currently on board to direct.</p><p>Since the writers and director have only just been locked down, there still hasn&#39;t been any public discussion of what era of the lucrative CoD franchise the movie will tackle. Based on the duo&#39;s past work, something contemporary seems most likely, but it may be awhile before we have any confirmation of the story or casting.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/paramounts-call-of-duty-movie-taps-the-writers-of-yellowstone-and-friday-night-lights-175331091.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>I mentioned the design of the Scape first, and for good reason. It shows attention to detail, with a lot of thoughtful flourishes. The best of those is the dock that comes included with the headset. It charges the Scape inductively, so there&#39;s no need to align any charging pins, and it cleverly houses the headset&#39;s 2.4GHz wireless transmitter. When connected to your main PC, the dongle can sit inside the dock, ready to go when you want to use it with your PlayStation 5, PS4, Nintendo Switch or another PC or Mac (sorry, Microsoft fans, there&#39;s no Xbox support). The base also has wire channels to make cable management easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those same thoughtful design touches extend to the headset itself. On the back are four buttons, a dial and a toggle that cover nearly every function of the Scape. You can adjust the volume, mute the built-in mic, switch between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity, power the headset on or off, turn the RGB lighting on or off and switch between three EQ presets. What’s more, all of the controls feel distinct and are easy to use. There&#39;s also a USB-C connection for wired audio and a three-pole headphone jack for the detachable microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The headset is primarily made of plastic, with a touch of brushed metal. Fractal offers the Scape in two colors — the aptly named light and dark — and despite the company&#39;s choice of materials, the headset feels undoubtedly premium. Tilt adjustment is limited — it&#39;s not possible to lay the ear pads flat on a table, for example — but the headband offers a fair amount of resistance, adding to the high-end feel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the Scape could be more comfortable. Clamping force feels just about right, but there&#39;s not enough padding along the top of the headband. I found I could wear the headphones for a few hours, but I eventually had to take them off to relieve the pressure that had built up on the top of my head. I&#39;m also not a fan of the fabric Fractal used for both the headband and ear pads. It feels scratchy and it&#39;s not great at dissipating heat. Thankfully, the high-density memory foam beneath is plush and the pads were deep and wide enough to comfortably accommodate my ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fractal has made it easy to swap the ear pads if needed; they come right off with just a small amount of force. For the time being, the company isn&#39;t selling replacements, but a spokesperson told me Fractal will send customers who need new pads a set for free. You just need to contact their support team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p>Out of the box, the Scape&#39;s dynamic drivers are tuned to a soft v-shaped curve, with an emphasis on accuracy over character. Bass frequencies are punchy without being bloated, and there&#39;s nice detail to mid-focused instruments like guitars. To my ear, the one issue with the Scape&#39;s default tuning were the upper mids and treble frequencies. They weren&#39;t shouty to the point of being sibilant, but there was definitely a harshness to the vocals of singers like Jeff Buckley and Caroline Polachek who are known for their falsetto. Thankfully, this was easy to fix with the Scape&#39;s built-in EQ settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have more to say in the software section of this review, but Fractal&#39;s Adjust app allows you to make parametric EQ adjustments. This is different to most gaming headsets, which often limit people to restrictive fixed-band tweaks. Even when I used just five potential points of customization, I found I had a great deal of control over the tonality of the Scape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, for casual music listening these are excellent headphones capable of covering many different genres. When it comes to gaming, they&#39;re great too — with some caveats. For singleplayer games, the default tunings are an excellent match. Playing <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, the Scape did a great job of reproducing the game&#39;s immersive sound design, allowing me to soak in all the little audio details Sucker Punch packed into its rendition of 13th century Japan. The soundstaging isn&#39;t as expansive and lush as I&#39;m used to with my Sennheiser HD 600, but for a pair of closed-back headphones, it&#39;s above average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to competitive first-person shooters, some tweaks are required. I found all the default presets produced too much bass to easily isolate sound cues in games like <em>Valorant</em>. Again, Fractal&#39;s software made this simple to fix; however, the Scape can only store three presets. Some gaming headsets, particularly those from Steelseries, come with tunings for hundreds of different games. For the ultra-competitive gamer, this can be useful since every game has a different sound engine. I&#39;m not one of those people, so I found the Scape had just the right amount of customization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One feature you won&#39;t find on these headphones is active noise cancellation (ANC). Don&#39;t get me wrong, ANC is great, but I also didn&#39;t feel like the Scape was a worse product without it. My girlfriend is a Pelton fanatic and she does all of her daily classes without wearing headphones in our small apartment. In that situation, the Scape&#39;s passive noise isolation was enough to block the loud music coming from those workouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the one area where the Scape could have been better is Bluetooth connectivity. It&#39;s a 5.3 headset, but codec support is limited to SBC and AAC. If you&#39;ve ever tried a pair of wireless headphones only to be disappointed by how they sounded, SBC was probably to blame. When I used the Scape over Bluetooth, there was a subtle difference, but in a beat &#39;em up like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/absolum-is-awesome-and-i-cant-wait-to-play-it-on-october-9-180037272.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Absolum</a>, the game&#39;s excellent sound design was less effective because it sounded more compressed, with more lag between what was happening on-screen and the effects that followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have liked to see Fractal support more modern codecs like aptX Adaptive, but given that you need a dongle like the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DG34HRNC&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a26c23e4-4281-4083-bd46-43706d9234ab&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Creative+BT-W6&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAQ-2ZMLBi8rydET6_KoZwtgS2cvcR0oHzACeLntNqZaZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCreative-Wireless-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Snapdragon%2Fdp%2FB0DG34HRNC%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Wireless-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Snapdragon/dp/B0DG34HRNC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1OMRKEF34HG9M&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SfC5gFD_N5Kfzq8YcDrkGiBqQW8P4rDtAD04kN2vip-a-V-goOEalzgrrzRbQFc7PWQq1qzFq6eAtxes2UOUiTnOCpJCASc3JFO_3LhN0c6cb0t6ZY52tAM9ejPsh7MjjP3P5h_JTW0Y7tuWLJ0gOWQEzg7tQp7klf7uUM62lwK1A7A964PQMZTOwvgesTOYshh2xI2nak2Y5QiPkHS2K8YuaJgG7bmoJtW6_ai08Qw.cHYlXItM63TfjGe5bQe1x32f0lvYrUbZE7Vn4Xl_8_4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=creative+bt-w6&amp;qid=1761331977&amp;sprefix=creative+bt-w6%2Caps%2C100&amp;sr=8-1">Creative BT-W6</a> to get access to those protocols on PCs and consoles, I can&#39;t fault the company for its decision. Also missing from the Bluetooth equation is multipoint support, meaning I wasn&#39;t able to connect the Scape to my PC or Switch and my iPhone at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Scape&#39;s detachable microphone is fine but uninspiring. In listening back to a chat I had with some friends over Discord, I found the Scape compressed my voice to the point where there wasn&#39;t a lot of life or nuance to it. The optional noise cancellation algorithm does a good job of filtering out nearby commotion, but does so at the expense of adding more compression. You can flip the microphone to mute yourself, and if you&#39;re feeling lazy, the Scape also has a built-in mic — though it sounds about as good as you might imagine. Still, it&#39;s handy in a pinch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I mentioned Fractal&#39;s Adjust software, but what I didn&#39;t note is that it&#39;s not an app you need to install on your computer. Instead, it&#39;s a website you can access through any Chrome-based browser. It&#39;s a small thing, but one I really appreciate. I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve had to troubleshoot issues with Windows that were caused by a conflict created by Logitech G Hub or NZXT Cam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web-based software itself is simple, with two pages, named Lighting and Audio, encompassing all the options you can tweak. The Scape comes with 10 lighting themes out of the box, and like the headset itself, these presets are understated and classy. Naturally, you can also create your own lighting schemes, and the tool for doing so is fairly robust.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p>When it comes to the EQ adjustments you can make with the Adjust app, the one thing I&#39;ll add here is any presets you save are stored on the Scape, so they&#39;re available everywhere you want to use the headset. That was great because it meant I didn&#39;t need to Alt-Tab out of a game to switch the headset to a more competitive tuning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one area where Fractal&#39;s software feels lacking is when it comes to microphone controls. It&#39;s possible to adjust sidetone (the volume of your mic input as heard through the headset) and enable microphone noise cancellation, but that’s it. It&#39;d be nice if it was possible to configure those settings for the two mics independently of one another, but the software doesn&#39;t support that right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="9fb21657-4bad-46bc-8533-78c1632fbf9d">Battery life</h2>
<p>According to Fractal, the Scape can go up to 40 hours on a single charge with RGB lighting off. With the feature turned on, battery life drops to about 26 hours. I&#39;ll be honest, I had a tough time putting those claims to the test because of how easy it is to charge the headset. As best as I can tell, those estimates are accurate. I managed to get three days of battery life from the Scape with the RGB lights turned on and about eight hours of use each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One nice touch: when you tap the power button, the RGB lights will briefly illuminate to indicate how much battery life the Scape has left. Those same lights will turn off when you place the headset to charge so that they&#39;re not distracting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="cece1b68-49ab-4233-9968-33cfe753db13">The competition</h2>
<p>With the Scape, Fractal has entered a crowded market. That said, the Scape is competitive with some of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">best gaming headsets you can buy right now</a>. At $200, it&#39;s $100 cheaper than the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://a.co/d/iRTB82r" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Audeze Maxwell</a>, Engadget&#39;s pick for the best premium gaming headset. The Scape doesn&#39;t sound as good as the Maxwell or offer LDAC support for Bluetooth connectivity, but it&#39;s lighter and charging is easier thanks to the included charging base. If you ask me, the Scape also looks a lot better too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t tell by now, I think the Fractal Scape is a great gaming headset. There are models like the Audeze Maxwell that beat it in one or two categories, but for $200 the Scape is an excellent all-around package. Nitpicks about comfort aside, the Scape sounds and looks great. It&#39;s also a tremendous first effort by Fractal, and I can&#39;t wait to see what the company does next in the audio space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Samsung <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-internet-expands-to-pc-with-new-beta-program">launched</a> a desktop version of its web browser. Why bother putting its mobile browser on Windows? Well, the company offers a hint in describing Samsung Internet as &quot;evolving from a PC browser that waits for input to an integrated AI platform.&quot; So, surprise, surprise: It&#39;s about AI.</p>
<p>As one would imagine, Samsung Internet on Windows supports cross-platform syncing of data like bookmarks, browsing history and autofill. The company says it also prioritizes privacy and security, offering standard features like tracker blocking and a privacy dashboard.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But those aren&#39;t likely the main reasons Samsung is launching a desktop web browser in 2025. (Incidentally, Samsung briefly <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-internet-browser-finally-comes-to-windows-pc/">launched</a> Samsung Internet for Windows in 2024, before <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-internet-windows-seemingly-pulled-from-microsoft-store/">pulling</a> it from the Microsoft Store without fanfare.) Instead, this launch appears to be about positioning it in the rapidly emerging landscape of AI browsers.</p>
<p>AI browsers have been all the rage lately. Samsung&#39;s move follows the launch of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas-launches-on-macos-today-170735742.html">OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT Atlas</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-makes-edges-copilot-mode-a-bit-smarter-160031147.html">Microsoft&#39;s Edge Copilot Mode updates</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/operas-ai-browser-will-cost-you-20-a-month-123022110.html">Opera Neon&#39;s early access</a> and general availability for <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-is-now-free-for-everyone-170017509.html">Perplexity&#39;s Comet browser</a>. Samsung says its cross-platform browser will advance its &quot;vision for ambient AI,&quot; anticipating your needs and offering more personalized assistance. If Samsung wants to be part of that fray, it makes sense for its software to be available on the desktop, too.</p>
<p>Samsung Internet is available (via a beta program) for Windows 11 and Windows 10 (version 1809 and up). You can sign up <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://browser.samsung.com/beta">on the product page</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/samsungs-web-browser-arrives-on-windows-with-an-ai-future-on-its-radar-163526726.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been around three and a half years since season four of <em>Stranger Things</em> premiered. We finally <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PssKpzB0Ah0"><ins>have an actual trailer</ins></a> for the fifth and final season of Netflix&#39;s retro-soaked adventure series. It&#39;s a good thing, as the first batch of episodes drop on November 26.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this is a real trailer with tons of footage and not a teaser. It&#39;s over two minutes of Hawkins-based goodness. This is an action-packed affair that&#39;s heavy on emotion and light on the type of 1980s-style humor the show has become known for. That seems right, given the stakes are higher than ever.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="96f3212b171a490994185a39926c682c"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PssKpzB0Ah0?si=EMTzoaGwg7_16K7b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>If you just clicked on this and don&#39;t plan on actually watching the trailer, this is when I go into some light spoilers. It looks like the gang is trapped in Hawkins following the events of season four. There&#39;s a military enclosure around the city and, surprise, Vecna is back and looking for vengeance.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a very scary scene in which the entity looks to be controlling or torturing poor Will and we don&#39;t even know if he has a cassette player loaded with Kate Bush just out of frame. It&#39;s all very tense.</p>
<p>While the show premieres on November 26, this isn&#39;t a one-and-done season drop like many Netflix shows. It&#39;s being split into three installments. The first batch of episodes are set for November 26, with another batch dropping on December 25. The final episode will air on December 31 and is even <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-stranger-things-finale-theaters-tickets-1236408174/"><ins>coming to some movie theaters</ins></a>. It&#39;s a holiday miracle.</p>
<p>The showrunners do promise that this season will finally tell us <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-season-5-upside-down-will-disappearance-answers-duffer-brothers/"><ins>exactly what the upside down is</ins></a>, which is something to look forward to.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest is adding a new way to find clothes, furniture and other sources of aesthetic inspiration through its app. It&#39;s called Pinterest Assistant, and it&#39;s an AI-powered search and recommendation tool that uses knowledge of your Pinterest activity to tailor its responses.</p><p>Whereas other search features work best when you have a specific thing you&#39;re looking for in mind, Pinterest says the Pinterest Assistant is meant to handle more open-ended requests. Asking for pillows that match your &quot;living room decor&quot; is supposed to be enough for the AI to surface interesting results. To do that, the Pinterest Assistant looks at the items you&#39;ve saved and the boards you&#39;ve created (for example, a board full of living room decor inspiration), compares it with the things Pinterest users with similar taste have saved and displays visual results tailored to you.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Pinterest-Assistant-screenshots.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Pinterest-Assistant-screenshots.jpg" style="height:4320px;width:7680px;" alt="Three screenshots showing the Pinterest Assistant mic icon, what you see when you dictate a prompt and results provided by Pinterest Assistant." data-uuid="6a3b0659-5589-4a92-b70a-e18ba65c4c55"><figcaption>You start a search with Pinterest Assistant by tapping on the mic icon.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pinterest</div></figure><p>Pinterest appears to be specifically interested in the multimodal aspect of this new feature. The main way the company imagines you&#39;ll interact with Pinterest Assistant is via a mic icon in the Pinterest app that starts a voice search. The AI assistant then takes that audio prompt and uses it to filter and analyze visual content to find the best fit. Besides surfacing items you might not have found on your own, Pinterest says the whole process should be &quot;closer to how people shop in real life.&quot;</p><p>Rolling out its own AI features puts Pinterest in an interesting place when it comes to AI content on its platform. Users <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pinterest/comments/1jnyei4/ai_on_pinterest/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">have complained</a> that the growing amount of AI-generated material on Pinterest has made it hard to find real things to buy or add to a board. In May, the company started <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/pinterest-will-now-tell-you-when-youre-looking-at-ai-generated-content-163008812.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">labeling AI content</a> in the app to make finding real items easier, and earlier in October it added a way to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/pinterest-will-let-you-dial-down-ai-slop-in-your-feeds-130000337.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">&quot;dial down&quot;</a> the amount of AI generated content users see in the app. Pinterest Assistant isn&#39;t necessarily a solution for an AI slop problem the company is struggling to solve, but it might help users who are sick of sifting through AI content anyway.</p><p>Pinterest Assistant begins rolling out in beta today to users in the US who are 18 and over, with wider availability coming in the next weeks and months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/pinterest-has-its-own-ai-assistant-now-160000183.html?src=rss]]></description>

Today, Threads is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/new-threads-features-more-personalized-experience-you-control/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">adding</a> more controls that let users determine who can reply to their posts.&nbsp;</p><p>One new feature is Reply Approvals, where the user will get a first look at responses before allowing them to appear publicly. The approval option can be turned on for individual posts rather than as a blanket policy for more granular control over replies. Threads is also adding new filters for viewing post replies. Now you can look at replies just from other Threads users you follow or sort them by mentions.</p><p>Threads has already had a busy week. Earlier this week, the social network introduced its take on ephemeral <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-introduces-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-160000228.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">&quot;ghost&quot; posts</a>, akin to the limited-time visibility features on Instagram Stories and many other platforms. According to parent company Meta&#39;s third-quarter earnings call, Threads has grown to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-reaches-150-million-daily-users-and-is-ramping-up-ads-214259945.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">150 million</a> daily active users.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-is-making-it-easier-to-hide-replies-you-dont-like-154500456.html?src=rss]]></description>

This model is also available in storage sizes of 128GB and 512GB, but neither version is on sale.</p> 
<p>This particular model easily made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html"><ins>best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2</ins></a>.

It just gets the job done. We loved the speed on offer here. It was the fastest of all the cards we tested when transferring games and loading games.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="b2b5c42ca56a461ab32c9c163aa47062" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-256G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQGVLYF/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark.</p> 
<p>The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn&#39;t just for Nintendo&#39;s latest console. It&#39;ll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Norton Security has some reliable products, but its VPN isn&#39;t one of them. In my <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html">Norton VPN review</a>, I argued that it&#39;s only really worthwhile if you can get a discount on it as part of a Norton 360 package — and even in that case, you should only use it for non-sensitive activities due to some holes in Norton&#39;s comprehensive privacy policy.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a lot of conditions, so I&#39;d understand if you&#39;re here because you&#39;ve decided Norton VPN isn&#39;t for you. Read on to learn your options for cancelling this VPN, getting a refund and replacing it with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">a better provider</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-off-norton-vpn-auto-renewal"><strong>How to turn off Norton VPN auto-renewal</strong></h2>
<p>The simplest way to cancel Norton VPN is to stop your subscription from automatically renewing. That way, you&#39;ll have until your plan expires to look for a new VPN. Note that the steps below are the same no matter how you got Norton VPN, whether on its own or as part of Norton 360 — though they only apply if you subscribed through the Norton website, not an app store.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sign into your account at my.norton.com. You&#39;ll be taken to your account dashboard with your subscriptions tab visible. If it&#39;s not, click on <strong>My Subscriptions.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>On your subscriptions hub, find the plan you get Norton VPN through. Click the words <strong>Manage Renewal </strong>or <strong>Cancel Subscription Renewal</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the window that appears, click <strong>Unsubscribe</strong>. Select a reason for cancellation (no need to be truthful) and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, you&#39;ll have to wade through several pleas for you to stay. Stand firm and keep clicking through until you can click <strong>No thanks, cancel my subscription</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue clicking <strong>Next </strong>until you see a confirmation that auto-renewal has been turned off. Wait 24 hours for the change to take effect.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you change your mind after turning auto-renewal off, you can turn it back on again anytime before the subscription expires. For those who bought through an app store, there&#39;s no way to turn off auto-renewal; you can only cancel the subscription altogether. See the end of the next section to learn how to do that.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-norton-vpn-and-get-a-refund"><strong>How to cancel Norton VPN and get a refund</strong></h2>
<p>You can request a refund on any annual subscription for 60 days after paying. Monthly subscriptions can only be refunded once, within 14 days of paying — if you renew a monthly plan then decide to cancel, you&#39;re out of luck.</p>
<p>The only way to get a refund is to contact Norton directly. If you&#39;re ready to go cold turkey, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In a browser, open support.norton.com.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down until you see nine buttons arranged in a 3x3 grid. Find the second button down in the left-hand column, <strong>Contact us</strong>, and click on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the email address for your Norton account. Check that inbox for a verification code, then enter it in the next box and click <strong>Verify</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the live chat asks you what you need help with, select <strong>Purchase &amp; Billing, </strong>then <strong>Request refund</strong>. Give a reason in the dropdown menu.</p></li>
<li><p>As usual, be persistent until you get a message in writing that your refund will be processed. Wait at least three days for the money to appear.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you subscribed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you&#39;ll have to cancel through the same platform where you started. Just go into the subscriptions page of the store&#39;s mobile app, find your Norton VPN subscription and click the <strong>Cancel </strong>button beside it. After that, just follow the prompts, then request a refund using the steps above.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-uninstall-norton-vpn"><strong>How to uninstall Norton VPN</strong></h2>
<p>To get your money back from Norton, you can&#39;t just shut off auto-renewal. You&#39;ll have to cancel your plan immediately and delete all Norton apps from your devices. I recommend following these steps even if you aren&#39;t eligible for a refund, since Norton software is notoriously hard to uninstall and will crop back up if you don&#39;t completely root it out.</p>
<p>On Android and iOS, uninstalling Norton VPN is relatively easy — after cancelling your subscription, delete it like you would any other app. Things are a bit trickier on the desktop OSes. On Windows, <strong>hold the Windows key and press R</strong> to make a black box appear. Type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong> and hit <strong>Enter.</strong> A list of programs should appear; click on Norton VPN, then click <strong>Uninstall/Change </strong>and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>On a Mac, open your Applications folder and find Norton VPN. Click the app icon and drag it to the trash. This should start a separate program called Norton Uninstaller. Click <strong>OK, </strong>enter your password if asked, then click <strong>Uninstall</strong>. Finally, you&#39;ll need to restart your computer to finish uninstalling.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-norton-vpn-alternatives"><strong>Norton VPN alternatives</strong></h2>
<p>Once you&#39;ve dispensed with Norton VPN, you can get started with a provider that fits your needs better. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a>, my current top pick in our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a>, takes privacy more seriously than Norton and has superior app design and speeds. <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html">Surfshark</a> is the fastest VPN, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN</a> has the best features and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">ExpressVPN</a> is the friendliest for beginners.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-norton-vpn-uninstall-it-and-get-your-money-back-150000872.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of US government agencies are backing a potential move by the Commerce Department to ban TP-Link routers, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/30/tp-link-proposed-ban-commerce-department/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a>. Multiple sources familiar with internal deliberations spoke with the publication on the condition of anonymity, including a former senior Defense Department official.</p>
<p>A months-long interagency process involving the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense took place this summer to consider the sweeping move. Investigations into the company stemming from national security concerns<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/tp-link-routers-are-being-investigated-by-several-us-authorities-151552304.html"> <ins>have been taking place</ins></a> since at least last year.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the heart of the potential ban is a concern that TP-Link retains ties to China, despite splitting from Chinese corporation TP-Link Technologies to become a standalone entity in 2022. A spokesperson for TP-Link denied any Chinese ties, saying &quot;any adverse action against TP-Link would have no impact on China, but would harm an American company.&quot;</p>
<p>US officials told <em>The Washington Post </em>they are concerned because under Chinese law, TP-Link must comply with Chinese intelligence agency requests and may even be pressured to push malicious software updates to its devices. US-based TP-Link Systems <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TP-Link;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=79539c2e-109d-49c3-a6ab-ddd018132f09&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ee2ae188-4902-42ab-ada5-3be5deba428d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TP-Link&amp;linkText=said&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cC1saW5rLmNvbS91cy9wcmVzcy9uZXdzLzIxNjU2LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWUyYWUxODgtNDkwMi00MmFiLWFkYTUtM2JlNWRlYmE0MjhkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cC1saW5rLmNvbS91cy9wcmVzcy9uZXdzLzIxNjU2LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaI6Wo8AtjIbMUgq8n-_oBO1G0iyRm2BGLBTgUXGMDGk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tp-link.com%2Fus%2Fpress%2Fnews%2F21656%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tp-link.com/us/press/news/21656/"><ins>said</ins></a> the company is “not subject to the direction of the PRC intel apparatus.”</p>
<p>TP-Link routers are among the most popular in the United States, with the company claiming 36 percent of US market share. Earlier this year however, former American cybersecurity official Rob Joyce <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20250305/117983/HHRG-119-ZS00-Wstate-JoyceR-20250305.pdf"><ins>testified</ins></a> before Congress that TP-Link’s market share was roughly 60 percent, thanks in part to selling its equipment below cost in order to drive out competition.</p>
<p>The potential ban of TP-Link products is another in a long list of bureaucratic moves or discussions that have come against the backdrop of trade negotiations between the US and China. While a potential breakthrough in these talks <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us---china-trade-talks-see-one-year-pause-on-punitive-tariffs-140550358.html"><ins>was achieved</ins></a> today, a source for <em>The Washington Post </em>said a ban on TP-Link products remains a bargaining chip for the administration.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/us-government-is-getting-closer-to-banning-tp-link-routers-145528317.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Trump had previously made some characteristically <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/rare-earths-china-trump-threats">explosive threats</a> that he would impose new 100 percent tariffs on imports from China as a retaliation to Xi’s tightening grip on rare earths, the processing of which is almost entirely controlled by China. These materials are essential for manufacturing everything from smartphones and EVs to military equipment. As part of the (for now) temporary truce, China reportedly agreed to pause the new measures for the next 12 months in exchange for Trump lowering Chinese tariffs by 10 percent.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG and Ubisoft have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/10/lg-and-ubisoft-bring-iconic-game-just-dance-now-to-lg-smart-tvs/">teamed up</a> to bring the motion-controlled rhythm game <em>Just Dance Now </em>to LG Smart TVs. The game will be available from December in the LG Gaming Portal for LG TV users in the US and Europe running webOS 22 or later, with no additional hardware required.</p>
<p><em>Just Dance Now </em>originally launched in 2014 as a mobile app for iOS and Android, before Ubisoft brought the game to Apple TV a year later. A main series spinoff aimed at people who don&#39;t own a console, <em>Just Dance Now </em>offers a library of hundreds of songs that span decades of music, which you&#39;ll be able to access for free for a limited time each day. If that just isn’t enough dancing time to satisfy you, you can subscribe to one of Ubisoft&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://justdancenow.com/"><ins>paid plans</ins></a> or purchase song packs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Just Dance Now </em>was originally designed to be played using your phone as a controller, with your handset of choice functioning much like the Wii Remote did in the very first <em>Just Dance </em>game back in 2009. In the LG Gaming Portal version of the game, the motion-sensing LG Magic Remote becomes the peripheral, so you really don&#39;t need any extra gear.</p>
<p>Ahead of the December launch, the <em>Just Dance Now </em>app will be available in beta, allowing players to try three songs on the first day, followed by one daily for the remainder for the two-week trial. Ubisoft hasn’t announced the release date for the beta yet.</p>
<p>The LG Gaming Portal is gradually becoming a viable alternative to a console for people with a casual interest in games. The cloud version of Xbox Game Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/lg-smart-tvs-are-getting-xbox-game-pass-this-week-200422697.html"><ins>joined the platform</ins></a> back in April, and the new and improved GeForce NOW app <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-geforce-now-game-streaming-gets-rtx-5080-gpus-better-image-quality-and-more-193040331.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> up to 4K 120Hz game streams on LG TVs a few months ago.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/just-dance-now-is-coming-to-lg-smart-tvs-140042944.html?src=rss]]></description>

Almost six years after the game&#39;s debut, Nintendo is hoping you&#39;ll return to your island — or start a new one — as a Switch 2 version with a bunch of upgrades will arrive on January 15. A free update is coming to both the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game on the same day.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">A 12-minute video</a> on Nintendo&#39;s YouTube channel went over a lot of the changes. The Switch 2 version has improved graphics with support for 4K visuals in TV mode. You&#39;ll be able to play with mouse controls via Joy-Con 2. Nintendo suggests that could make it easier for you to redecorate your home, make custom designs and create messages on the bulletin board. With the Switch 2&#39;s microphone, you&#39;ll be able to use your voice to call out to the residents of your island when you pick up the new megaphone item.&nbsp;</p><p>The online features are getting upgrades. Up to 12 players will be able to hang out on the Switch 2 version, up from eight. There&#39;s support for the Switch 2 camera feature as well — you and your friends will be able to see each other&#39;s faces above your characters as you play.</p><p>The Switch 2 edition of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-switch.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> will be available as physical and digital versions for $65. There’s an upgrade pack for the original game, which will run you $5 — that’s very reasonable, especially by Nintendo standards.&nbsp;</p><p>As for folks who are sticking with the original Switch for the time being, there are a lot of new features coming via a free update. It brings a new locale to your island in the form of a hotel on the pier. You can decorate the room as you wish based on certain themes, and get souvenirs from the gift shop as a reward. You can pick up new outfits from the hotel too. The update will also add a dream world with up to three more islands for you and your friends to play and create in. There&#39;ll be fresh craftable items and the option to expand your home storage to up to 9,000 items (up from 5,000).&nbsp;</p><p>The update will bring new collaborations to <em>ANCH </em>as well. You can pick up various Nintendo consoles as decorative items, and even play games on them if you have a Switch Online subscription. Lego items are coming to the game, along with a Legend of Zelda and Splatoon crossovers that work with select Amiibo. Of course, all of these additions will hit the Switch 2 version as well. I can imagine that a bunch of people are going to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-cross-new-horizons-two-month-review-143541385-143541919.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">spend many more hours in <em>ANCH</em></a><em> </em>in 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-switch-2-edition-of-animal-crossing-new-horizons-will-land-on-january-15-135000347.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Doodle is featuring something special for gamers today: A <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/doodles/pac-man-45-years/">tribute to Pac-Man&#39;s 45th anniversary</a>, just in time for Halloween. For today and tomorrow, you&#39;ll be able to play four haunted-house mazes especially designed for the event by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/legos-new-2650-piece-pac-man-arcade-includes-a-mechanical-crank-095625676.html">Pac-Man&#39;s</a> parent company, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pac-man-live-action-film-in-development-190708541.html">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a>. Like other games in the franchise, you&#39;ll have to control Pac-Man and eat all of the dots in a maze without being caught by a ghost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the Ghost Gang, with Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, is back for this event. The maze&#39;s design reflects the ghost&#39; personalities, so you can move according to how you think each one will try to get you. Blinky the red ghost, for instance, tends to actively chase Pac-Man, while the others would corner him. If you grab a Power Pallet, you&#39;ll be able to activate a time-limited event wherein you can chase and eat the ghosts, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To play the game, simply go to the Google homepage on desktop or fire up the Google app on mobile, whether on Android or on iOS. On a PC, you control Pac-Man with your keyboard&#39;s arrow keys, while on mobile, you&#39;ll have to swipe or press and move your finger to change directions.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/google-celebrates-pac-mans-45th-anniversary-with-a-halloween-doodle-133034299.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is rolling out passkeys for backups, which is great news for anyone who has been on the platform for years. This will add another layer of security to anything that&#39;s been backed up, including chats, photos, voice notes and more.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also convenient because passkeys don&#39;t force users to keep track of yet another password or encryption key. For the uninitiated, passkeys <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html">allow users to access personal data</a> via biometric markers like fingerprints and face scans. However, these particular passkeys will also work with screen lock codes on certain devices.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature is rolling out today, but it&#39;ll take a few weeks to reach every user. WhatsApp <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-whatsapp-became-the-worlds-default-communication-app-144520113.html">is a gigantic global platform</a>. Once updated, folks can get started by heading to the Settings tab.</p>
<p>This is just another layer of security for WhatsApp users, as these backups are already end-to-end encrypted. The platform has been doing that since 2021. It began offering passkey support <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-is-enabling-passkey-support-on-ios-182527962.html">just last year</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/whatsapp-will-let-you-use-passkeys-for-your-backups-130022640.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has rolled out the capability to create character cameos of your pets, doodles, original personas or even objects in the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html">Sora</a> app, which you can put in your videos. You can start the process by going to your profile page in the Sora app, tapping on the &quot;Create cameo&quot; button and then uploading a video of the character (or pet) you want the model to generate. The company says just a few seconds of footage are enough, and you can even use old Sora-generated videos as reference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then give your character a display name and describe how you want the model to animate it. In the example OpenAI uploaded, for instance, the description for a wicked green witch character reads: &quot;She glides with a mysterious, whimsical grace, speaks in rhymes when casting spells, and her pointed hat always tilts as if listening to secrets on the wind.&quot; You can choose permissions for each character you create. Under the &quot;Who can use this&quot; permissions section, you can choose between several options: Only me, People I approve, Mutuals, Everyone and Everyone (excluding specific sets of users). Whenever you want to generate a Sora video with a cameo in it, you can just tag a specific character.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sora 2 launched with a cameo feature that lets you create an avatar of yourself, but this is a new application of the capability. Cameo, the app that allows users to buy videos from celebrities, just <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/openai-sued-for-trademark-infringement-over-soras-cameo-feature-113047158.html">sued OpenAI</a> over trademark violation by using the &quot;cameo&quot; name. It said that OpenAI&#39;s use of the word is likely to cause consumer confusion and dilute its brand. OpenAI disagreed &quot;that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word &#39;cameo.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to character cameos, OpenAI has introduced &quot;stitching,&quot; allowing you to stitch several clips together and connect videos. There&#39;s now also a leaderboard that shows the most cameod and most remixed videos.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of an AI-focused reorganization, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://sources.news/p/youtube-announces-ai-reorg-and-layoffs">told employees</a> that it will offer voluntary buyouts, according to an internal company memo. At the same time, he emphasized that there would be no specific role eliminations as part of new structure.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform,&quot; Mohan wrote. &quot;We also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we&#39;ve decided now is the right time to offer a voluntary exit Program.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The restructuring is designed to help YouTube focus on fast-growing areas like AI while &quot;driving faster decision making and execution,&quot; the memo states. To that end, the platform is organizing into three separate product organizations: viewer products, creator and community products, and subscription products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viewer products will focus on the viewer experience by making improvements to search &amp; discovery, engagement, the living room experience and &quot;our foundation of responsibility.&quot; Creator and community products, meanwhile, is &quot;driving creation through genAI tools, Shorts, Live and creator support. Subscription products, as you&#39;d expect, will operate around  subscription growth across Music, Premium and OTT (YouTube TV) platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mohan noted that YouTube has been the number one streamer in the US for the last two years. So far, it has signed up 125 million Premium and Music subscribers, along with 8 million YouTube TV subs. The platform has paid out $100 billion to its ecosystem (presumably, creators and recording artists).&nbsp;</p>
<p>YouTube isn&#39;t the only tech giant reducing headcount while citing AI as an impetus. Amazon recently announced that it had <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html">laid off 14,000 people</a>, while citing the need to be &quot;lean&quot; due to transformative technology like AI. Meanwhile, YouTube parent Alphabet announced its first-ever $100 billion quarter, largely on the strength of cloud services and search.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/youtube-is-offering-employees-buyouts-as-part-of-an-ai-focused-reorganization-120047466.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It looks like <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-now-has-a-feed-for-ai-slop-205751808.html">Meta&#39;s Vibes</a> feed is just the start of the company&#39;s pivot toward AI slop. In an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/META-Q3-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">earnings call</a>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that &quot;we&#39;re going to add yet another huge corpus of content&quot; to Meta&#39;s recommendation system, via AI&#39;s ability to create and remix content — so you&#39;re likely to see even more AI generated posts on Facebook and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Social media has gone through two eras so far. First was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly. The second was when we added all the creator content,&quot; he said, seemingly suggesting that AI content will be the third era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuckerberg added that recommendation systems that &quot;deeply&quot; understand AI content are &quot;increasingly valuable&quot; since they can &quot;help you achieve your goals.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then nodded to Vibes, calling it an example of a new type of content enabled by AI. Retention on the feed &quot;is looking good so far, and its usage keeps growing quickly week over week,&quot; he proclaimed. Furthermore, there are more opportunities to build &quot;many more novel types of content aheads, as our new models become ready,&quot; Zuckerberg added. To put some numbers to Vibes takeup, Meta CFO Susan Li said that users have generated over 20 billion images in the feed to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta has already introduced a number of AI features across its social media platforms. Those include in-app photo and video editing <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-stories-is-getting-new-ai-powered-editing-tools-175500693.html">via text prompts</a> directly in Instagram Stories, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-introduced-revised-guardrails-for-its-ai-chatbots-to-prevent-inappropriate-conversations-with-children-200444230.html">AI chatbots</a> across WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, and a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/introducing-meta-ai-app-new-way-access-ai-assistant/">standalone Meta AI app</a> that includes an AI assistant and discovery feed.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-add-a-huge-corpus-of-ai-content-into-its-recommendation-system-113027353.html?src=rss]]></description>

Instead of being an expensive and bulky headset like the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro, Xreal&#39;s devices are like over-sized sunglasses that project a virtual display atop transparent lenses. I <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">genuinely loved Xreal&#39;s $649 One Pro</a> for its comfort, screen size and relative affordability.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that I&#39;m testing the M5-equipped Vision Pro (full review to come soon!), it&#39;s clearer than ever that Apple should replicate Xreal&#39;s winning formula. It&#39;ll be a long while before we&#39;ll ever see a smaller Vision Pro-like device under $1,000, but Apple could easily build a similar set of comfortable smart glasses that more people could actually afford. And if they worked like Xreal&#39;s glasses, they&#39;d also be far more useful than something like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Meta&#39;s $800 Ray-Ban Display</a>, which only has a small screen for notifications and quick tasks like video chats.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Xreal_One_Pro_8.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Xreal_One_Pro_8.jpg" style="height:3675px;width:6000px;" alt="Xreal One Pro smart glasses" data-uuid="3013a393-5c82-460d-988d-0f39935ed6f2"><figcaption>Xreal One Pro smart glasses</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>While we don&#39;t have any pricing details for Project Aura yet, given Xreal&#39;s history of delivering devices between $200 and $649, I&#39;d bet they&#39;ll come in cheaper than the Galaxy XR. Xreal&#39;s existing hardware is less complex than the Vision Pro and Galaxy XR, with smaller displays, a more limited field of view and no built-in battery. Project Aura differs a bit with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/xreals-project-aura-android-xr-tethered-compute/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">its tethered computing puck</a>, which will be used to power Android XR and presumably hold a battery. That component alone could drive its price up to $1,000 — but hey, that&#39;s better than $1,800.</p><p>During my time with the M5 Vision Pro, I couldn&#39;t help but imagine how Apple could bring visionOS to its own Xreal-like hardware, which I&#39;ll call the &quot;Vision Air&quot; for this thought experiment. The basic sunglasses design is easy enough to replicate, and I could see Apple leaning into lighter and more premium materials to make wearing the Vision Air even more comfortable than Xreal&#39;s devices. There&#39;s no doubt it would be lighter than the 1.6-pound Vision Pro, and since you&#39;d still be seeing the real world, it also avoids the sense of being trapped in a dark VR headset.&nbsp;</p><p>To power the Vision Air, Apple could repurpose the Vision Pro&#39;s battery pack and turn it into a computing puck like Project Aura&#39;s. It wouldn&#39;t need the full capabilities of the M5 chip, it would just have to be smart enough to juggle virtual windows, map objects in 3D space and run most visionOS apps. The Vision Air also wouldn&#39;t need the full array of cameras and sensors from the Vision Pro, just enough track your fingers and eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>I could also see Apple matching, or even surpassing, Project Aura&#39;s 70-degree field of view, which is already a huge leap beyond the Xreal One Pro&#39;s 57-degree FOV. Xreal&#39;s earlier devices were severely limited by a small FOV, which meant that you could only see virtual screens through a tiny sliver. (That&#39;s a problem that also plagued early AR headsets like Microsoft&#39;s HoloLens.) While wearing the Xreal One Pro, though, I could see a huge 222-inch virtual display within my view. Pushing the FOV even higher would be even more immersive.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ys2v-LZ08Uw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In my review of the original Vision Pro, I wrote, &quot;If Apple just sold a headset that virtualized your Mac&#39;s screen for $1,000 this well, I&#39;d imagine creative professionals and power users would be all over it.&quot; That may be an achievable goal for the Vision Air, especially if it&#39;s not chasing total XR immersion. And even if the Apple tax pushed the price up to $1,500, it would still be more sensible than the Vision Pro’s $3,500 cost.&nbsp;</p><p>While I don’t have high hopes for Android XR, its mere existence should be enough to push Apple to double-down on visionOS and deliver something people can actually afford. If Xreal can design comfortable and functional smart glasses for a fraction of the Vision Pro’s cost, why can&#39;t Apple?&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/whats-next-for-vision-pro-apple-should-take-a-cue-from-xreals-smart-glasses-113000437.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Proton, the company behind <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html"><ins>Proton VPN</ins></a> and other encrypted apps like Proton Mail and Proton Drive, just launched a new web page called the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://proton.me/business/pass/breach-observatory__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!BkjLa99XHx4n18VAfC9uG1l1eSg9PQJszZlYp7U3UtwW-4ceYSqKSo8dGnDZZnwMwA7VXHPve7jUWQ7RZ53PGp_MHQox1cQSlpI$"><ins>Data Breach Observatory</ins></a> that aims to make accurate cybercrime data more widely accessible. The Observatory is intended to be a continually updated report that records any data leak detected on the dark web, with information sourced from the underground data marketplaces themselves.</p>
<p>The reason for the Observatory, according to Proton, is that too many studies of cyberattacks depend on organizations reporting when they&#39;ve been hacked. A company might not make a data breach public for fear of backlash from customers, regulators or stockholders. Although it&#39;s impossible to tell how many breaches aren&#39;t reported, Proton believes it&#39;s a significant portion.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Compounding the transparency problem, most stolen data is advertised and traded on dark web markets that are hard to trace without specialized knowledge, like how diamond thieves don&#39;t tend to fence their loot at above-board jewelry stores. In other words, while most people know that personal information is frequently stolen and leaked, it&#39;s very difficult to know how much data is getting stolen, how often breaches occur and who&#39;s buying and selling the goods.</p>
<p>Proton&#39;s solution is to monitor the dark web itself, watching locations where data thieves go to advertise stolen information. By keeping an eye on these exchanges, Proton believes the Data Breach Observatory will be able to warn victims as early as possible, including before the targets themselves are aware of the leak. Making breach reports available in one place is also meant to educate the public about the actual size and scope of cybercrime, while making it harder for companies to keep quiet about getting hacked.</p>
<p>Proton plans to update the Observatory in &quot;near real time,&quot; working with a risk detection firm called <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://constella.ai/"><ins>Constella Intelligence</ins></a>. It remains to be seen whether they&#39;ll be able to keep up the workload — according to Proton&#39;s own research, around 1,571 data breaches have occurred in 2025 so far, compromising well over 100 billion records. A clearing house for reporting on all of those definitely sounds valuable, but at around five breaches a day, it&#39;ll be a busy page.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/proton-launches-data-breach-observatory-to-track-personal-info-leaks-110047833.html?src=rss]]></description>

At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you&#39;re basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty.</p> 
<p>Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say,<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/doctor-who-the-well-review-signing-makes-you-feel-heard-200528202.html"> <em>Doctor Who</em></a>,<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/severance-season-two-review-even-before-the-finale-innie-rights-and-humanity-made-for-a-stronger-show-100003889.html"> <em>Severance</em></a>,<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/andor-season-2-review-a-star-wars-miracle-an-ode-to-rebellion-190057159.html"> <em>Andor</em></a> and/or<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-two-premiere-future-days-highlights-the-fracture-between-ellie-and-joel-020029565.html"> <em>The Last of Us</em></a>). Then, when the deal ends or you&#39;ve binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don&#39;t come around all that often and, when they do, it&#39;s easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we&#39;re keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/black-mirror-is-now-a-delightful-escape-from-reality-070019017.html"> something new</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart</a>, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

<p>Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan.</p>

What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address.</p>

It makes the covers more fun, and readers of comics and graphic novels will appreciate the added hues (though they may be happier with an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablet</a> for better image detail). Color is just one factor to consider when picking out the best ereader. The lights, screen quality, housing and buttons make a difference too. Then there’s the software: Do you want to stay in the Kindle ecosystem or get a device that can handle lots of apps? We tested more than a dozen ereaders to come up with our recommendations.

No new Kindle ereaders were announced at the event. Boox announced two new devices as well, a new Note Air5 C tablet and the Palma 2 Pro, both with color. We’re in the process of testing the latter for inclusion in this guide..</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader">What to look for in an ereader</h2> 
<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Color ereaders add a <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> 
<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.</p> 
<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading-features"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> 
<p>With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> 
<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.</p> 
<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-other-features"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> 
<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> 
<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you&#39;ll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> 
<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p>

<p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.</p>

<p>Buying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p>

Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Titles from some publishers like <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/publisher/tor-publishing-group/207044153?_c=1">Tor</a> and public domain classics from sites like <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p> 
<p>To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adobe;elmt:;cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=73e6d253-5a10-4f58-b539-815233e32f36&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adobe&amp;linkText=Adobe+Digital+Editions&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Vib29rL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbnMvZG93bmxvYWQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Vib29rL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbnMvZG93bmxvYWQuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZHqqiiAxW0zph0RbXm7OdiW_5kDVWfy8mgD2jdFYezz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy9lYm9vay9kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb25zL2Rvd25sb2FkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYfVa2G0Z86CjcQZkqWy4CaRDfMi0aF2N0kUMd-_t-hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE).

<p>Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe&#39;s, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Send+to+Kindle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3NlbmR0b2tpbmRsZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc2VuZHRva2luZGxlIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5ZVsNxdCVtDYx5iNTxXHLeRX1mGBWg9NRQRPJNtX_j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsendtokindle" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle">Send to Kindle</a> page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.</p> 
<p>Boox also uses a browser uploader called <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://push.boox.com/#/push/file">BooxDrop</a> (along with <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZ0_NBysfk">many other methods</a>) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> 
<p>Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/bookshoporg-is-now-selling-ebooks-113033975.html">up to 100 percent of the profits</a> will go to local booksellers.

<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-read-library-books-on-an-ereader"><strong>How to read library books on an ereader</strong></h3> 
<p>Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html">Overdrive</a> and its companion app <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a>. On a <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader">Kobo</a>, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.</p> 
<p>To read library books on a <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> 
<p>For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox&#39;s Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> 
<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders">How we test ereaders</h2> 
<p>When putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p> 
<p>Over the course of the past two years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:47;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html">Amazon’s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> 
<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: &quot;A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.&quot;</p> 
<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.</p>

After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.</p> 
<p>I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There&#39;s a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be <a data-i13n="cpos:49;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">better served by an E Ink tablet</a>, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-ereader-faqs">Ereader FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-an-ereader-and-an-e-ink-reader"><strong>What&#39;s the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?</strong></h3> 
<p>Really, they are the same thing. <a data-i13n="cpos:50;pos:1" href="https://www.eink.com/about?company">E Ink</a> is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.</p> 
<p>But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink <em>tablets</em>. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to <a data-i13n="cpos:51;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">helping you pick out an E Ink tablet</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-there-ads-on-my-ereader"><strong>Are there ads on my ereader?</strong></h3> 
<p>The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereader-has-the-longest-battery-life"><strong>Which ereader has the longest battery life?</strong></h3> 
<p>Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> 
<p>Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> 
<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p>

<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> 
<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:52;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle-only+books&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2I_bm9kZT0xOTI3MTcwNjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYj9ub2RlPTE5MjcxNzA2MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVfQtILpNl4j-jhmpgChMRVcssUkpbLilOSDy4FrIhd1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fnode%3D19271706011" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19271706011">Kindle-only books</a> is much larger <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Kobo;elmt:;cpos:53;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;linkText=than+Kobo%E2%80%99s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2tvYm9vcmlnaW5hbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vdXMvZW4vcC9rb2Jvb3JpZ2luYWxzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATjuNnZvRXlMJC6dkHZ86gdxoVLQ4PXMnCI_YfD7Ivq4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkobooriginals" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/kobooriginals">than Kobo’s</a>.

<h3 id="jump-link-which-ereader-is-best-for-library-books"><strong>Which ereader is best for library books?</strong></h3> 
<p>Both Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p>

The company knows that those using digital cameras probably want that same blend of portability and performance for their own footage. That’s why it’s launching the new Wireless Micro Camera Kit, which outputs audio over USB-C or via a 3.5mm line-in.</p> 
<p>As with the Wireless Micro, the new set includes a pair of microphones and a transmitter that all sit in a portable charging case. You’ll also find a pair of furry wind screens should you need to film in less than favorable weather. But unlike that model, the receiver comes with both a cold shoe mount and a 1.1-inch AMOLED screen. That will let you configure the audio setup on the fly, plus you’ll get battery data for all three units and an on-screen visualizer.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>It would appear that Rode noticed user gripes that its own kit was being shown up by DJI’s Mic Mini, which had a transmitter with its own 3.5mm jack and shoe mount for camera connection. In addition, Rode has added Bluetooth Direct Connect to the microphones so they’ll connect to your iOS phone directly via the Rode Capture App. Which, like the 3.5mm, was a notable omission from the older hardware.</p> 
<p>In terms of battery life, Rode says the kit and the charging case will hold up to 21 hours of use before you need to head back to an outlet.</p> 
<p>Plus, to sweeten the deal, Rode is also throwing in one of its first-generation USB-C smartphone receivers into the package for free.</p> 
<p>Rode’s Wireless Micro Camera Kit is available to purchase today for $149.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It hasn&#39;t been a good year for Xbox so far. Microsoft has released its earnings report for the quarter ending on September 30, and it has revealed that its revenue from the Xbox hardware fell by 30 percent year-over-year. Take note that the revenue decline doesn&#39;t reflect any dip in sales caused by the console&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html">$20-to-$70 price hike</a>, since that took effect on October 3. Similarly, Microsoft only raised the price for its Game Pass Ultimate subscription <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">from $20 to $30</a> in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenue from Xbox content and services remained relatively unchanged from the same period last year. Microsoft says it saw growth from Xbox subscriptions and third-party content, but it was &quot;partially offset&quot; by the decline in first-party gaming content.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Xbox division was one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html">most affected teams</a> when Microsoft started cutting down its global workforce earlier this year, with the company cancelling games that were being developed for the console. Microsoft <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-the-studio-developing-the-perfect-dark-reboot-and-cancelling-the-game-182257902.html">scrapped</a> the modern reimagining of <em>Perfect Dark</em>, a first-person shooter from the year 2000, and even closed down the Xbox studio working on it. The company also <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs-162200526.html">cancelled Everwild</a>, a project that had long been in development by Xbox studio Rare, also in the midst of its mass layoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Microsoft&#39;s $77.7 billion revenue was 17 percent higher compared to the same period last year, and its operating income was up by 22 percent. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted a few highlights about the company&#39;s earnings call on X, mostly focusing on its AI efforts. He said that the company will increase its AI capacity by 80 percent this year and will double its data center footprint over the next two.&nbsp;</p>
