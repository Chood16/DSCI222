Of course, we&#39;re keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weird tech</a>.</p><p>You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either.

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. </p><p>The first “<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;slk:Smart Play;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and <em>The Imperial March</em>.</p><p>Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000436.html" data-i13n="slk:check out Lego&#x002019;s Smart Play system in person;cpos:9;pos:1">check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person</a> and I’ve never been more envious of him.

These are the first chips to be built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says they offer improved performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life improvements for laptops. </p><p>The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased a Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.</p><p>Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some <em>Battlefield 6</em> on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html" data-i13n="slk:came away impressed;cpos:23;pos:1">came away impressed</a>. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU.

Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, but that’s before factoring in costs such as tariffs.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg" style="height:5464px;width:8192px;" alt="Muxi" data-uuid="86d61664-366b-44f6-87b7-62c3c0830829"><figcaption>Muxi</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Segway</div></figure><p>Segway is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html" data-i13n="cpos:93;pos:1">expanding</a> its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions.

You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.</p><p>Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines.

Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. </p><p>It’s interesting stuff.

It has a built-in barcode scanner you can use to quickly add items to a shopping list. It&#39;s possible to sync the items to Instacart for grocery delivery. There&#39;s also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge&#39;s crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899.

Load it with ingredients, pick one of the 500 dishes in Nosh&#39;s repertoire and the robot will put everything together. While it has water and oil reservoirs, as well as a built-in spice rack, you&#39;ll still need to prep the fresh ingredients before adding them to the machine. Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you&#39;re ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.</p><p>Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/ces-2026-the-tone-outdoors-t1-solved-the-biggest-problem-with-leaf-blowers-234309500.html" data-i13n="cpos:129;pos:1">T1 leaf blower</a> (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September.

This time around, Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em> — one of our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">favorite games of last year</a> — is crossing the great divide. The fantasy action RPG will hit Sony’s console <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-is-coming-to-playstation-5" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">on February 17</a>, one day shy of the game’s first anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>As it happens, an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/avowed-updated-roadmap" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">anniversary update</a> is set to go live on all platforms at the same time. This includes a new game+ mode (allowing those who have beaten the RPG to replay it with all their gear and upgrades from their previous run), a photo mode, a new weapon type and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Avowed</em> is set in the same universe as Obsidian’s Pillars of Eternity games. It tasks you with investigating a fungal plague that has infested the world. “The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant,&quot; Engadget senior reporter Jessica Conditt wrote. &quot;<em>Avowed</em> is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Old-school, upright vacuums left a lot to be desired, and cordless models are here to right many of those wrongs. These types of vacuums tend to be thinner, lighter and easy to maneuver around a home, and you don’t really have to sacrifice suction power anymore to get those benefits. Dyson isn’t your only option anymore either — like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from today. Variety is great, but it can also lead to decision fatigue and confusion.<br><br>We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the best cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which is the best cordless vacuum for you.</p>

However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the &quot;self&quot; part isn&#39;t really there — instead, there&#39;s a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It&#39;s convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well.</p>

But it&#39;s ultimately <em>just fine</em> in comparison to our top picks; it&#39;s not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it&#39;s just awkward) and it doesn&#39;t have the smoothest handling.</p>

The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-cordless-vacuum">Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design-and-bin-capacity">Design and bin capacity</h3> 
<p>Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices.</p> 
<p>Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners.</p> 
<p>Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session.</p> 
<p>If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-suction-and-power-modes">Suction and power modes</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power.</p> 
<p>Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength.</p> 
<p>Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible.</p> 
<p>If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-floor-type">Floor type</h3> 
<p>The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it&#39;s still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life">Battery life</h3> 
<p>Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-base-style">Base style</h3> 
<p>Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby.</p> 
<p>Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-smart-features">“Smart” features</h3> 
<p>Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area.</p> 
<p>Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">best robot vacuums</a>, or even the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">best budget robot vacuums</a>, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t <em>need</em> Wi-Fi or an app connectivity.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-cordless-vacuums">How we test cordless vacuums</h2> 
<p>Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-cordless-stick-vacuums-faqs">Cordless stick vacuums FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-does-the-battery-last-on-a-cordless-vacuum">How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum?</h3> 
<p>Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cordless-vacuums-be-as-powerful-as-corded-ones">Can cordless vacuums be as powerful as corded ones?</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuums do sacrifice a bit in overall power when compared to corded models, but that doesn’t mean they can’t handle everyday messes just as well. If suction power is your biggest concern, we recommend springing for a high-powered, high-end cordless vacuum since, typically, the more expensive a cordless vacuum is, the stronger the suction. Also, cordless vacuums have the edge over corded models when it comes to weight and convenience: cordless vacuums are much lighter than their corded counterparts, and you’ll never have to worry about placement or picking a fight with a cord while cleaning your living room.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-cordless-vacuums-effective-on-pet-hair">Are cordless vacuums effective on pet hair?</h3> 
<p>Yes, cordless vacuums can handle pet hair well, but we recommend getting a model with strong suction power to get the best results. It’s also wise to get one with a larger bin, since pet hair can quickly fill up smaller bins, which may force you to stop cleaning to empty the vacuum before finishing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-methods-for-maintaining-a-cordless-vacuum-cleaner">What are the best methods for maintaining a cordless vacuum cleaner?</h3> 
<p>Maintaining a cordless vacuum is super easy and helps to keep it running like new. First, make sure to empty the dustbin regularly — don’t let it overfill, as this can impact suction. Many models have washable filters, so rinse them out every few weeks (check your manual for specifics) and let them dry completely before putting them back.</p> 
<p>Next, take a look at the brush roll — hair and debris can get tangled up in there over time. Most vacuums make it simple to remove the brush roll, so you can snip away any tangles with scissors. If your vacuum has a replaceable battery, try not to let it fully drain too often, as this can reduce its lifespan. A quick wipe-down of the vacuum’s exterior and attachments will also keep everything looking fresh.</p> 
<p>Lastly, keep an eye on the sensors and charging contacts, as dust can build up there too. A gentle wipe with a dry cloth every now and then will do the trick.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-cordless-vacuums-also-be-used-to-clean-curtains-and-upholstery">Can cordless vacuums also be used to clean curtains and upholstery?</h3> 
<p>Cordless vacuums are surprisingly versatile, and many come with attachments specifically designed for surfaces like curtains, upholstery and even mattresses. A handheld vacuum mode, which is common in cordless models, makes it easy to tackle these areas. Look for a soft brush or an upholstery tool in the attachments for the vacuum you’re considering — it’ll help remove dust and pet hair without damaging fabrics. For curtains, it’s a good idea to use a lower suction setting if your vacuum has adjustable modes. This prevents the fabric from getting pulled into the nozzle.</p>

But going by the specs on Lumus’ newest waveguides, we’re set for a major upgrade in terms of future capabilities.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-wave-guide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-wave-guide.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses&#39; lenses." data-uuid="7f2fc40a-ee7f-46f3-a0e9-7f2abc7f4bba"/><figcaption>If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses&#39; lenses.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The first model I tried featured Lumus’ optimized Z-30 waveguides, which not only offer a much wider 30-degree FOV, they are also 30 percent lighter and 40 percent thinner than previous generations. On top of that, Lumus says they are also more power efficient with the waveguides capable of hitting more than 8,000 nits per watt. This is a big deal because smartglasses are currently quite limited by the size of batteries they can use, especially if you want to make them small and light enough to wear all day. When I tried them on, I was dazzled by both the brightness and sharpness I saw from the Z-30s despite them being limited to 720 x 720 resolution. Not only did the increase in FOV feel much larger than 10 degrees, colors were very rich, including white, which is often one of the most difficult shades to properly reproduce.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-70-fov-model.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lumus-70-fov-model.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="I had to take a photo of one of Lumus&#39; non-functioning smartglasses with the company&#39;s 70-degree FOV waveguide, because two out of three of the working ones had already broke and the last one that I used was being held together by tape.

I was able to view some videos and a handful of test images and I was completely blown away with how much area they covered. It was basically the entire center portion of the lens, with only small unused areas around the corners. And while I did notice some pincushion distortion along the sides of the waveguide’s display, a Lumus representative told me that it will be possible to correct for that in final retail units. But make no mistake, these waveguides undoubtedly produced some of the sharpest, brightest and best-looking optics I’ve seen from any smartglasses, from either retail models or prototypes or. It almost made me question how much wider FOV these types of gadgets really need, though to be clear, I don’t think we’ve hit the point of diminishing returns yet.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/super-thin-waveguide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/super-thin-waveguide.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="This is one of Lumus&#39; thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm." data-uuid="9340a55b-ea8c-421b-9e82-4fa5b309dd58"/><figcaption>This is one of Lumus&#39; thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Other advantages of Lumus’ geometric reflective waveguides include better overall efficiency than their refractive counterparts along with the ability to optically bond the displays to smartglasses lenses. That means unlike a lot of rivals, Lumus’ waveguides can be paired with transitions lenses instead of needing to resort to clip-on sunglass attachments when you go outside. Lumus also claims its designs also simplifies the manufacturing process, resulting in thinner waveguides (as small as 0.8mm) and generally higher yields.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, taking high-quality photos of content from smartglasses displays is incredibly challenging, especially when you’re using extremely delicate prototypes, so you’ll just have to take my word for now.  But with Lumus in the process of ramping up production of its new waveguides with help from partners including Quanta and SCHOTT, it feels like there will be a ton of smartglasses makers clamoring for these components as momentum continues to build around <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the industry’s pick for the next “big” thing.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/lumus-brought-a-massively-wider-fov-to-smartglasses-at-ces-2026-233245949.html?src=rss]]></description>

It wasn&#39;t perfect — it misread a capital &quot;I&quot; as an &quot;H&quot; — but it was surprsingly intuitive. I was able to quickly trace out a short sentence and even correct a typo (a swipe from left to right will let you add a space, while a swipe from right to left deletes the last character).&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ9IsB72nVk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Alongside handwriting, Meta also announced a new teleprompter feature. Copy and paste a bunch of text — it supports up to 16,000 characters (roughly a half-hour&#39;s worth of speech) — and you can beam your text into the glasses&#39; display.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever used a teleprompter, Meta&#39;s version works a bit differently in that the text doesn&#39;t automatically scroll while you speak. Instead, the text is displayed on individual cards you manually swipe through. The company told me it originally tested a scrolling version, but that in early tests, people said they preferred to be in control of when the words appeared in front of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Teleprompter is starting to roll out now, though Meta says it could take some time before everyone is able to access.&nbsp;</p><p>The updates are the among the first major additions Meta has made to its display glasses since launching them late last year and a sign that, like its other smart glasses, the company plans to keep them fresh with new features.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While wave upon wave of smartglasses and face-based wearables crash on the shores of CES, traditional glasses really haven’t changed much over the hundreds of years we’ve been using them. The last innovation, arguably, was progressive multifocals that blended near and farsighted lenses — and that was back in the 1950s. It makes sense that autofocusing glasses maker IXI thinks it’s time to modernize glasses.</p>
<p>After recently announcing a 22-gram (0.7-ounce) prototype frame, the startup is here in Las Vegas to show off working prototypes of its lenses, a key component of its autofocus glasses, which could be a game-changer.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IXI’s glasses are designed for age-related farsightedness, a condition that affects many, if not most people over 45. They combine cameraless eye tracking with liquid crystal lenses that automatically activate when the glasses detect the user’s focus shifting. This means that, instead of having two separate prescriptions, as in multifocal or bifocal lenses, IXI’s lenses automatically switch between each prescription. Crucially — like most modern smartglasses — the frames themselves are lightweight and look like just another pair of normal glasses.</p>

<p>With a row of prototype frames and lenses laid out in front of him, CEO and co-founder Niko Eiden explained the technology, which can be separated into two parts. First, the IXI glasses track the movement of your eyes using a system of LEDs and photodiodes, dotted around the edges of where the lenses sit. The LEDs bounce invisible infrared light off the eyes and then measure the reflection, detecting the subtle movements of your eye and how both eyes converge when focusing on something close.</p>
<p>Using infrared with just a &quot;handful of analog channels&quot; takes far less power than the millions of pixels and 60-times-per-second processing required by camera-based systems. IXI’s system not only tracks eye movements, but also blinking and gaze direction, while consuming only 4 milliwatts of power.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12d1bba0-ec27-11f0-bbbc-16c5fed13b32" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/12d1bba0-ec27-11f0-bbbc-16c5fed13b32" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="IXI autofocus lenses" data-uuid="c25a9be8-a13b-31aa-84fc-453d028d5a89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Most of the technology, including memory, sensors, driving electronics and eye tracker, is in the front frame of the glasses and part of the arms closest to the hinge. The IXI prototype apparently uses batteries similar in size to those found in AirPods, which gives some sense of the size and weight of the tech being used. The charging port is integrated into the glasses’ left arm hinge. Naturally, this does mean they can’t be worn while charging. IXI says that a single charge should cover a whole day’s usage.</p>
<p>The prototype frames I saw this week appeared to be roughly the same weight as my traditional chunky specs. And while these are early iterations, IXI’s first frames wouldn’t look out of place in a lineup of spectacle options.</p>
<p>The team has also refined the nose pieces and glasses arms to accommodate different face shapes. Apparently, when testing expanded from Finland to the UK, British faces were “...different.” A little harsh when talking to me, a Brit.</p>
<p>Eiden pulled out some prototype lenses, made up of layers of liquid crystal and a transparent ITO (indium tin oxide) conductive layer. This combination is still incredibly thin, and it was amazing to watch the layers switch almost instantly into a prescription lens. It seemed almost magical. As they’re so thin, they can be easily integrated into lenses with existing prescriptions. It can also provide cylindrical correction for astigmatism too.</p>
<p>Autofocus lenses could eliminate the need for multiple pairs of glasses, such as bifocals and progressives. Even if the glasses were to run out of power, they’d still function as a pair of traditional specs with your standard prescription, just lacking the near-sighted boost. IXI’s sensor sensitivity can also offer insight into other health conditions, detect dry eyes, estimate attentiveness and, by tracking where you’re looking, even posture and neck movement. According to Eiden, blink rate changes with focus, daydreaming and anxiety, and all that generates data that can be shown in the companion app.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, the product could even potentially adapt prescriptions dynamically, going beyond the simple vision correction of Gen 1. For example, it could offer stronger corrections as your eyes get fatigued through the day.</p>
<p>IXI appears to be putting the pieces in place to make these glasses a reality. It still needs to obtain the necessary medical certifications in order to sell its glasses and get all the production pieces in place. It’s already partnered with Swiss lens-maker Optiswiss for manufacturing. Eiden says the final product will be positioned as a high-end luxury glasses option, selling through existing opticians. The company hopes to finally launch its first pair sometime next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html?src=rss]]></description>

Atlas can work autonomously, via a teleoperator or with &quot;a tablet steering interface,&quot; and the robot is both strong and durable. Boston Dynamics says Atlas has a reach of up to 7.5 feet, the ability to lift 110 pounds and can operate at temperatures ranging from minus 4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. &quot;This is the best robot we have ever built,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said in the Atlas announcement. &quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Boston Dynamics has been publicly demoing its work on humanoid robots since at least 2011, when <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-12-darpa-atlas.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">it first debuted Atlas</a> as a DARPA project.

Kira looks like a TikTok e-girl decked out in a frilly outfit complete with Razer neon green accents, while Zane is her edgy masculine alternative who kind of reminds me of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.meming.world/wiki/Giga_Chad" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Giga Chad meme</a>, but with extra snake tattoos.

Finally, there’s an avatar made in the likeness of Faker (Lee Sang-hyeok), the most successful and well-known League of Legends player of all time and one of Razer&#39;s sponsored esports athletes.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-connected.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-connected.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion." data-uuid="b033651e-b4c3-4f15-970d-0ef496c4dd1e"><figcaption>The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The idea now is that instead of being trapped inside your computer, Ava or one of Razer’s other personas can sit on your desk and be your companion for everything. They can remind you of upcoming events, respond to questions or even comment on your outfit using Razer’s built-in camera. That said, if you need some privacy, the device’s mics can be muted and the company says its planning on putting a physical camera shutter on final retail models. Of course, Ava or any of the other avatars can still hang out while you game and give you advice. During my demo, Kira helped pick out a loadout in <em>Battlefield 6</em>  based on user criteria and even provided pros and cons for some of the game’s other equipment options.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/avatars.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/avatars.png" style="height:633px;width:1507px;" alt="Project Ava&#39;s expanded roster of AI companions" data-uuid="b918f479-ae59-431a-8ce7-833d6d12618b"><figcaption>Project Ava&#39;s expanded roster of AI companions</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, while I did get to see Kira and Zane talk, dance and sway in their little bottles, Sao and Faker weren’t quite ready to make their holographic debuts. But according to Razer, that’s sort of by design as Project Ava is very much a work in progress. Currently, the avatars’ responses are generated by X AI’s Grok (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">yikes!</a>), but the platform was created as a sort of open-source project that will support other models like Gemini or ChatGPT. </p><p>Down the line, Razer is hoping to add the ability for users to create their own unique avatars and companions based on their input or inspiration from real-world objects. Meanwhile, for avatars like Faker&#39;s because he’s also an actual person, Razer wants additional time to make the AI companion helpful with topics like real-time League of Legends coaching.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-zane.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/project-ava-zane.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="Say hello to Giga Chad, I mean Zane.

The &quot;Sort By&quot; menu will now be called &quot;Prioritize.&quot; Likewise, the &quot;View Count&quot; option has been renamed to &quot;Popularity;&quot; this will allow YouTube&#39;s algorithms to account for other metrics such as watch time to gauge how much other users are engaging with a particular video.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fender Audio may have announced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">new headphones and speakers</a> right before CES, but Las Vegas afforded us the first opportunity to see the brand’s new lineup in person. Fender Audio is a Fender-owned brand from Riffsound that’s designing and making new devices after licensing the name. It’s been a while since the guitar and amplifier company made any general-use speakers of its own, and this new arrangement is similar to what <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-20-marshall-updates-major-headphone-with-in-line-mic-for-more-talki.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Zound was doing with Marshall for a spell</a>. </p><p>Logistics out of the way, let’s get down to what the Mix and Ellie are like in the flesh. First, the Mix headphones offer a modular construction that allows you to replace nearly every piece as needed. The ear cups detach from the headband and the ear pads are replaceable. You can also swap out the battery, thanks to an easy-to-access slot behind one ear pad. And on the other side, a USB-C dongle for wireless lossless audio is stowed for safe keeping (wired lossless audio over USB-C is also available). </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-4.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Fender Audio Mix headphones" data-uuid="c9175cfb-32f0-4a57-9a22-cf0603105ae3"/><figcaption>Fender Audio Mix headphones</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fender Audio kept the controls simple on the Mix, opting for a single joystick for volume and playback changes. The joystick also serves as the power and pairing control as the only other button cycles through active noise cancellation (ANC) modes. In terms of sound, the Mix will satisfy listeners who crave deep bass, and vocals cut through clearly. In my brief demo, I would’ve liked more mid-range, but I’ll wait until I get a review unit for a full assessment there. I should mention the other standout feature is battery life: the Mix will offer up to 52 hours of use with ANC enabled (up to 100 hours with it off). </p><p>Then there are the Elie speakers. Both offer a similar set of features, which includes two wireless inputs for microphones (the company is working on its own model) and a combination XLR and 1/4-inch input for instruments. The Elie 06 is the smaller unit, housing a tweeter, full-range driver and subwoofer with 60 watts of output. The larger Elie 12 doubles all of that, serving as a more robust but still very portable option. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Fender Audio Ellie speakers" data-uuid="eabd1d5e-963f-4c92-abdb-8aab8fba9017"/><figcaption>Fender Audio Ellie speakers</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Both Elie units can be used in a single configuration or as a stereo pair. You can also connect up to 100 of the speakers via a Multi mode. Fender Audio has done a nice job here of checking all of the usual Bluetooth speaker boxes while offering something unique in terms all of those inputs. It’s like the company combined “regular” portable speakers with larger party boxes, offering something for customers who don’t want a massive device or any of the flashing lights. </p><p>Of course, none of these specs matter if the company didn’t ace the sound quality. While I’ll wait until I can spend several hours with some review units before I make any final judgement on these, I can tell you that both Elie speakers made a great first impression. There’s ample bass in the tuning for both, but obviously the larger Elie 12 offers more thump. Both units also provide excellent vocal clarity and nice details in the highs, as I made sure to select test tracks with lots of subtle sounds — like Bela Fleck’s banjo tunes. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fender-3.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speaker" data-uuid="55976e56-2bd8-4637-84bf-d2be1028642d"/><figcaption>The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speaker</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fender Audio says the arrival of the entire new lineup is imminent. Both the headphones and the Elie 6 will cost $299 and the Elie 12 is $399.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/hands-on-with-fender-audios-headphones-and-speakers-at-ces-2026-203104561.html?src=rss]]></description>

Also, be sure to check out our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best of CES 2026</a> list.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-micro-rgb-tvs">Samsung Micro RGB TVs</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d.jpeg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/a087c5f0-e9f4-11f0-87f1-6f39e4849c7d.jpeg" style="height:1732px;width:2400px;" alt="Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="3d2cc73b-d866-4d15-86d0-f4c3f2bbd879"/><figcaption>Samsung&#39;s flagship Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p><p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;cpos:4;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p><p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward.  </p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2><p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p><p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p><p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-evo-w6-wallpaper-tv">LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-1.jpg" style="height:1327px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV" data-uuid="c57ab13f-a9b0-4a6e-b9be-88d620777eda"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="slk:LG&#x002019;s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV;cpos:6;pos:1">LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</a> makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p><p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2><p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;cpos:7;pos:1">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p><p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p><p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2><p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p><p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p><h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2><p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p><p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p><p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p><p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-new-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-from-samsung-lg-and-tcl-190929614.html?src=rss]]></description>

But CES is also a place where companies feel free to ask some very strange questions about how technology could further infiltrate our lives. For example, should your toilet analyze your poop? Should your nails change color on command?  From experimental laptops to health tech that probably didn’t need a camera, these are the weirdest gadgets we spotted at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="slk:CES 2026;cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>.

Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.</p><h2 id="jump-link-vivoo-hygienic-flowpad-smart-menstrual-pad">Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" style="height:698px;width:1280px;" alt="Image of Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad" data-uuid="a782ed2d-1d1b-4b9b-8be4-934943b97f7f"><figcaption>Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivoo</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/vivoos-toilet-computer-keeps-an-eye-on-your-hydration-030000209.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Vivoo</a> looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized.

Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo-thinkbook-xd-rollable">Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid." data-uuid="5ca5fe56-6894-4cd9-8f38-2fd1b5e0de40"><figcaption>With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">ThinkBook XD Rollable</a> is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ohdoki-handy-2-pro">OhDoki Handy 2 Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" style="height:1012px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro" data-uuid="9f025e81-246a-4ff1-810a-6824e6d7216a"><figcaption>Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-handy-2-pro-is-an-overclockable-sex-toy-044456140.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro</a> arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ipolish">iPolish</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">iPolish</a> finally made <em>Total Recall</em> nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.</p><h2 id="jump-link-hisense-s6-followme-display">Hisense S6 FollowMe display</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/991681_12ce05cf7175457fab831066cb9b5d1b~mv2_copy.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/991681_12ce05cf7175457fab831066cb9b5d1b~mv2_copy.jpg" style="height:1299px;width:2309px;" alt="Hisense S6 FollowMe display" data-uuid="084ec8c7-0370-46d4-8f46-1b27d0beacac"><figcaption>Hisense S6 FollowMe display</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hisense</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-press-conference-live-190040504.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Hisense’s FollowMe display</a> is a screen that physically follows you around the room — which no one really asked for, but CES happily delivered anyway. Designed to reposition itself automatically so content stays in view, it feels like the logical endpoint of smart TVs becoming increasingly clingy. We haven’t seen it in action yet, but the idea of a display that refuses to be ignored is deeply on brand for 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps you like the idea of controlling your home appliances with your voice, but aren’t super keen on a data center processing recordings of you. Fair enough. The trade-off for most smart home conveniences is relinquishing at least some of your privacy. Today at CES, I saw a line of voice-controlled home appliances from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://emersonsmart.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Emerson Smart</a> that adjust power and setting via voice commands. But commands are recognized on the devices themselves, not carried through Wi-Fi and processed elsewhere. </p>
<p>The huge array of smart plugs, fans, heaters and even air fryers require no app for setup and don’t need access to Wi-Fi. Instead, I said, “hey Emerson, lights on” or “hey fan, turn on low” and the devices in the demo space acted accordingly. A few of the devices combine the mic with a speaker and can respond when a command is received. </p>
<p>A bit of built-in programing on the air fryers allow them to understand commands for 100 cooking presets, so saying things like, “reheat this pizza” or “cook these frozen french fries” will set the correct mode, time and temp. Of course you can also just say, “cook at 350 degrees for 10 minutes” and it’ll comply. Most of the commands for the other items are pretty simple but allow you to do things like set a timer, turn on oscillation and set intensity speeds. </p>

<p>Some of the devices allow for a small amount of programmability. Pressing and holding the button on the smart plug, for example, changes the wake word to “plug two,” doing it again swaps it to “plug three,” and so on. That way, if you have more than one plug in a room, you can operate them individually. </p>
<p>The small demo space in which I talked to the devices (that did its best to shut out the thrumming noise of the CES show floor) had at least six models active and listening for my words. When I said “Hey Emerson,” both an air fryer and one of the heaters responded. That was one of the limitations that I could see with the devices: If you outfit your entire home in Emerson Smart gear, it might take some time to name and position everything so it works in a coherent way. The lack of an app means that programmability is limited, too. That’s the trade-off the privacy-conscious or app-averse user will have to make if they want to turn their lamp on and fan up when they walk into a room just by talking. </p>
<p>As the only offline, non-DIY voice-controlled lineup of appliances out there, you’re stuck with whatever design Emerson Smart thinks look good. Thankfully, the overall design is clean and modern, if a little basic. The upcoming models of air purifiers and fans were decidedly more attractive. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year, over 4,000 exhibitors descended on Las Vegas, Nevada to showcase their wares at CES, and the Engadget team <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">was out in full force</a>. The week started with press conferences from the biggest companies at the show, which were often a flurry of AI buzzwords, vague promises and very little in the way of hard news.&nbsp;</p><p>More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It&#39;s appropriate, I guess, that as we&#39;re beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI&#39;s supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.</p><p>We&#39;re by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it&#39;s fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA&#39;s marathon keynote and Lenovo&#39;s somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it&#39;s been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weird new gadgets</a>, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.</p><p>Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.</p><p>If you&#39;ve been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there&#39;s still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — <em>Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-robot-switchbot-onero-h1">Best robot: Switchbot Onero H1</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_onero.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_onero.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Onero H1 robot" data-uuid="e8e2c923-e89e-4d67-a666-e9f22f20f070" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>Onero H1 robot</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Onero</div></figure><p>We saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026.

It&#39;s also kind of cute. The company hasn&#39;t said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we&#39;ll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — <em>Karissa Bell, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-accessibility-tech-wheelmove">Best accessibility tech: WheelMove</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_wheelmove.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_wheelmove.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="WheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairs" data-uuid="ac1a306c-5ea6-49e7-a5dc-04f717de9f33" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>WheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairs</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">WheelMove</a> offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It&#39;s portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.</p><p>This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn&#39;t overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. <em>— Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editor</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-tv-lg-wallpaper-tv-oled-evo-w6">Best TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lg.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lg.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="LG OLED Evo W6 &quot;Wallpaper TV&quot;" data-uuid="04742b2b-d615-48aa-bb8d-ced3cef59625" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>LG OLED Evo W6 &quot;Wallpaper TV&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>I’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">LG’s OLED Evo W6</a>. It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.</p><p>And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. <em>— Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-ai-hardware-subtle-voicebuds">Best AI hardware: Subtle Voicebuds</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_voicebuds.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_voicebuds.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Subtle Voicebuds" data-uuid="3295301d-77a6-4b3a-a360-c7bc5e779c5e" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>Subtle Voicebuds</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Subtle</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-subtle-voicebuds-use-ai-to-transcribe-your-words-below-a-whisper-or-in-very-loud-spaces-like-the-ces-show-floor-000000019.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Subtle’s Voicebuds</a> are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it&#39;s below a whisper in quiet spaces.

The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, <em>and</em> you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.</p><p>While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products.

They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-todays-bosch-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130020554.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">DIRIGERA</a> or use a Matter hub you already own.

Those woofers move in two directions, producing a lot more low-end tone than most soundbars are capable of on their own. What’s more, Samsung included its Convertible Fit Design tech that debuted last year, so you can lay this speaker flat or mount it on a wall and the built-in sensors will automatically adjust the driver output accordingly. So, if you’ve longed for deep bass on a soundbar without a large or ugly sub in the corner, you may finally get your wish later this year. <em>— Billy Steele, Deputy editor</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-audio-shokz-openfit-pro">Best audio: Shokz OpenFit Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_shokz.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_shokz.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Shokz OpenFit Pro" data-uuid="dd2e60ac-f05d-4aad-9922-cac380888d85" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>Shokz OpenFit Pro</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Shokz</div></figure><p>When it comes to open fit earbuds, companies that claim to offer active noise cancellation (ANC) usually don’t deliver; It’s difficult to effectively block external sound when your ears aren’t completely sealed off.

The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego&#39;s Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter, and you&#39;ll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing.

You also get a ton of ports, and with support for up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, the ROG Zephyrus Duo has more than enough performance to handle anything you can throw at it. — <em>Sam Rutherford, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-mobile-tech-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Best mobile tech: Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_trifold.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_trifold.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" data-uuid="c71e5967-c56b-4bfa-a1fa-abc8fe44e788" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung might have announced the latest iteration of its foldable smartphones in Korea, but CES was the first chance for many of us to see the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> in person. It’s a 10-inch Android tablet hidden within a 6.5-inch smartphone form factor.&nbsp;</p><p>The jump from the almost-square screen ratio of Samsung’s past foldables to approximately 4:3 is a major improvement. This is a device that I could happily watch entire movies on. There’s more horizontal space to read, more room to type and more bright, vivid AMOLED everything. Unfurling the sides is incredibly satisfying and, perhaps because it’s thicker, it has a reassuring heft, too. The rest of the spec sheet reflects another fashionable Galaxy phone with a 200-megapixel main camera and the biggest battery yet in a Samsung foldable.</p><p>It’ll likely be expensive though. Samsung hasn’t confirmed pricing in the US, but based on its launch cost in Korea, it could be around $2,500. — <em>Mat Smith, UK bureau chief</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-most-promising-concept-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable">Most promising concept: Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lenovo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lenovo.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable" data-uuid="db3f3c58-aa69-40a3-b812-b5734df79502" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>Concept devices are hard to judge because even the ones with a ton of potential might be too difficult to make or too niche to bring to market.

This means you have the option to choose from 16:10, 21:9 or even 24:9 depending on the situation, which feels like an incredible way to enhance racing games, flight sims and anything else that can take advantage of extra wide aspect ratios. Granted, when its screen is fully deployed, it does look a bit ungainly. But of all the concepts we saw this year at CES, the Legion Pro Rollable is the one we hope survives to become a proper retail product someday. — <em>Sam Rutherford, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id="jump-link-best-emerging-technology-ixi-autofocus-lenses">Best emerging technology: IXI autofocus lenses</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_ixi.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_ixi.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="IXI Autofocus lenses" data-uuid="4845f752-034a-4130-a369-9b9b8c549c49" data-display-size="standard"/><figcaption>IXI Autofocus lenses</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IXI</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">IXI’s autofocusing glasses</a> were a late addition to our discussions, but we were impressed by what could be a significant advancement in spectacle technology — something that’s been largely static since the 1950s. IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user&#39;s eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds.&nbsp;Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription.&nbsp;Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.</p><p>IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe.

Some trends stick, some don&#39;t.</p><p>Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product: The company&#39;s core concept of creative play has remained in place throughout its long history, boosted by a gradual and ongoing evolution of block types and brand tie-ins.</p><p>Announced at its first-ever CES press conference, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1">Smart Play</a> represents a thoughtful integration of technology to the classic toy. A tiny chip the size of a single Lego stud allows the company&#39;s Smart Bricks to sense what&#39;s around them, opening up new ways to play. The system will debut with a trio of Star Wars sets, but we’re sure Lego has plans for a wide range of licensed and unlicensed options.</p><p>Our team instantly fell in love with Smart Play, and Deputy editor Nathan Ingraham had the opportunity to both build some sets and talk with some of the people behind the technology. Amid parental anxieties about screentime, it&#39;s refreshing that Smart Play doesn&#39;t require an app or a screen to get started. Kids can just get building. — <em>Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief</em><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It&#39;s been almost two months since Fubo has stopped carrying NBCUniversal-owned channels, and there&#39;s still no sign of them coming back to the streaming service. Customers have had to find alternate methods of watching <em>Sunday Night Football</em>, all the latest episodes of the<em> Real Housewives </em>franchise, and so much more because of Fubo and NBCUniversal&#39;s contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Negotiations between the companies are ongoing and after more than six weeks, there is still no projected return date.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-is-youtube-tv-offering-a-rebate-while-these-channels-are-missing">Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing?</h2> 
<p>Fubo has announced that as of Jan. 1, 2026, pricing for select subscription tiers has been reduced. To know whether or not you&#39;re eligible for this rebate, you should have received an email from Fubo with a new price structure for your plan. Customers who received an email about a price reduction are on plans that previously included NBC programming, but if your current plan did not previously include NBC programming, your subscription is <em>not </em>affected at this time and the price remains the same.</p>

That&#39;s a dollar per month. This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21.</p> 
<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an unabashed fan of electric vehicles, even I have to admit that most of them are pretty boring. Their smooth, quiet and calm demeanors don&#39;t offer much in the way of intrinsic personality, which has led to many brands slapping on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-ev6-gt-first-drive-video-050142389.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">outré designs</a> and fake engine sounds to try and dial up the excitement.</p><p>To that end, a pair of offerings coming soon from UK-based EV startup Longbow Motors looks to deliver exactly that. The Speedster and Roadster are high-performance electric machines built using advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs. Those motors and a bespoke design enable an astonishing curb weight of just 2,200 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>For comparison&#39;s sake, that&#39;s over 100 pounds less than a Mazda Miata, the current king of lightweight roadsters. Longbow brought just the Speedster to CES 2026, displaying it on the show floor at the Donut Lab booth. Donut is a spinoff of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-verge-ts-ultra-electric-motorcycle-is-entirely-too-fast-213302452.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Verge Motorcycles</a>, which was the debut platform for the company&#39;s hub-less electric motor, creating a unique, Tron-style aesthetic.</p><p>But the technology is about a lot more than creating physics-defying motorcycles. Donut Lab is expanding its motors to all sorts of platforms, from scooters to heavy-duty trucks, creating a platform for easy adoption by electrified startups.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_021.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_021.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Donut Labs&#39; motors in the Longbow Motors Speedster" data-uuid="60c33371-0460-4500-95b7-7476d37b26ca"/><figcaption>Donut Labs&#39; motors in the Longbow Motors Speedster</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>Of all those platforms, though, Longbow&#39;s implementation is the most compelling I&#39;ve seen. The appeal starts with the style. Co-founders Daniel Davey and Mark Tapscott (who, with Jenny Keisu, founded Longbow after stints at Tesla and Lucid) told me they wanted to offer a classic but also modern and compelling look. The roofless Speedster has an edge over its glass-topped Roadster in terms of visual simplicity, but a complete lack of any protection from the elements — even a token windscreen — will make it viable only for the most committed of open-air enthusiasts.</p><p>Exposed or protected, you&#39;ll find yourself situated in an extremely spartan interior. Things like the gauge cluster and primary controls were covered, set to be revealed later, so I can&#39;t say for sure exactly what the Longbow looks like on the inside. But it was designed to be basic and minimal to an extreme, an abject rejection of the rest of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">touchscreen-laden machines</a> on the road today.</p><p>There is one seemingly unnecessary piece of equipment in the interior, though, and that&#39;s a shift knob. EVs, of course, rarely have transmissions, so there&#39;s no outright need to shift. The purpose of that lever is also a mystery for now, as neither Davey nor Tapscott would confirm its function, but it seems safe to expect some sort of simulated gearshift action, <em>a la</em> the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-shows-off-its-high-performance-ioniq-5-n-ev-150053657.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</a>.</p><p>The Longbow machines don&#39;t just lack a transmission, they lack a traditional drivetrain layout at all. The direct-drive Donut Lab motors are situated right inside the wheel, freeing up space inside the vehicle&#39;s chassis and helping it to maintain its pert dimensions.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_035.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Longbow Motors Speedster" data-uuid="221cff0b-9ddd-4c0c-aa68-e34e9222b104"/><figcaption>Longbow Motors Speedster</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>They also provide a distinctive look, filling up the wheels as they do. There is a downside to this arrangement, that being the heft of these motors hanging on the outer edges of the vehicle. The suspension, then, has to work a bit harder. But co-founder Mark Tapscott told me that the positives outweigh the negatives, and that the handling benefits of having multiple motors alone are worth it.</p><p>To keep the rest of the Longbow&#39;s weight centralized, the car uses a battery pack that runs largely along the center of the machine, stacked vertically rather than spread throughout the floor. This keeps the mass centralized in the vehicle while also enabling the kind of ultra-low seating you want in a machine like this.</p><p>It looks like it&#39;ll be quite a fun package to drive, and while exact power output from those Donut Lab motors hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet, the Speedster is said to sprint to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. That&#39;s supercar-like performance, but unfortunately, that performance won&#39;t come cheap.&nbsp;</p><p>The Speedster starts at ₤84,995, or just under $100,000 by current conversion rates. The Roadster is a fair bit more attainable at ₤64,995, or about $75,000. However, given the wonderfully chaotic state of international tariffs right now, expect the actual pricing here to be somewhat higher when they go into production later this year. Reservations are open now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://longbowmotors.com/#configure" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">on the company&#39;s site</a>.</p><p>That&#39;s a little too rich for my blood, sadly, but if you&#39;ve got the budget, a left-hand drive version will be available. And yes, it&#39;ll be fully road-legal in the U.S.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ces-2026-longbow-motors-shows-off-its-speedster-ev-with-donut-labs-in-wheel-motors-192329111.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok and FIFA are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://inside.fifa.com/organisation/media-releases/tiktok-preferred-platform-enhance-coverage-world-cup-2026" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">teaming up</a> for World Cup matches. On Thursday, FIFA said its media partners will be able to broadcast “parts of matches” on the social platform. The “preferred platform” partnership will run through the end of 2026.</p><p>How long the live clips will be is anyone’s guess because “parts of matches” is as specific as the announcement got. We emailed TikTok for clarification and will update this story if we learn more.</p><p>FIFA said the collaboration is designed to bring fans &quot;closer to the action.” Getting more to the point, TikTok&#39;s global head of content said live sports on the platform are shown to transform “fandom into measurable business results for our sports partners, with fans being 42 percent more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok.”</p><p>TikTok’s World Cup content will include filters, stickers and other “gamification” features. FIFA will also give “a select group of global TikTok creators” access to press conferences and training sessions to create content. &quot;As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted,&quot; FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom wrote in the announcement.</p><p>The World Cup runs from June 11 to July 19. It will take place in 16 cities across Canada, the US and Mexico.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-will-broadcast-some-unknown-portion-of-the-2026-world-cup-live-192035507.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted to save approximately three seconds and two mouse clicks when shopping online? Microsoft has something special just for you. The company just introduced something called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/january-2026/conversations-that-convert-copilot-checkout-and-brand-agents"><ins>Copilot Checkout</ins></a> at the NRF 2026 retail conference. This is exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s a shopping assistant embedded within Copilot.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out now in the US and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2026-01-08-PayPal-Powers-Microsofts-Launch-of-Copilot-Checkout"><ins>integrates with PayPal</ins></a>, Shopify, Stripe and Etsy. It lets people complete purchases directly inside of Copilot without having to withstand the grueling experience of being redirected to a retailer&#39;s website. Participating partners include Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Ashley Furniture.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a19640bde54b492dae8db428c6d67b15"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6X6WOP7_U4Q?si=SJpCIoxT7YGR2gYh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The retailers remain the actual merchant of record, so they&#39;ll still get customer data and all of that jazz. Microsoft controls the interface.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know what kind of safeguards are in place to prevent the AI from hallucinating its way into buying you a giant bounce house when you wanted to order some Bounce dryer sheets. Engadget has reached out to Microsoft to inquire about these safeguards and how exactly the money is handled.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big moment for AI shopping. OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-now-offers-a-dedicated-shopping-assistant-180000034.html"><ins>introduced a shopping assistant</ins></a> several months ago that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/"><ins>seems to work in a similar way</ins></a>. However, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-now-offers-a-dedicated-shopping-assistant-180000034.html"><ins>said that</ins></a> a related shopping assistant &quot;might make mistakes about product details like price and availability&quot; and it encouraged people to visit the merchant site for the most accurate details.</p>
<div id="e17fbb68a5bd47069f66852887879ec2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: OpenAI’s push to turn ChatGPT into a personal shopping assistant is running into a familiar problem: messy product data.<br><br>Read more from <a href="https://twitter.com/anngehan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnnGehan</a> 👇 <a href="https://t.co/atPdY1ruEa">https://t.co/atPdY1ruEa</a></p>— The Information (@theinformation) <a href="https://twitter.com/theinformation/status/2009272415730159641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft is advertising Copilot Checkout as a way to avoid the merchant site entirely, so maybe all kinks have been worked out. A recent report <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Information;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=347d04fc-65ea-4c2c-a312-96af854517ea&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Information&amp;linkText=from+The+Information&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvb3BlbmFpcy1zaG9wcGluZy1hbWJpdGlvbnMtaGl0LW1lc3N5LWRhdGEtcmVhbGl0eSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzQ3ZDA0ZmMtNjVlYS00YzJjLWEzMTItOTZhZjg1NDUxN2VhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvb3BlbmFpcy1zaG9wcGluZy1hbWJpdGlvbnMtaGl0LW1lc3N5LWRhdGEtcmVhbGl0eSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQMyoGLdrXio7IP31FspkvUNmq1KVtgjVQGdR76SxtvT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fopenais-shopping-ambitions-hit-messy-data-reality" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-shopping-ambitions-hit-messy-data-reality"><ins>from </ins><em><ins>The Information</ins></em></a> suggests OpenAI has had trouble integrating merchant partners for its own initiative, so maybe not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that automatic shopping isn&#39;t exactly a new concept. It&#39;s just the AI wrapper that&#39;s new. Remember those <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-15-amazon-dash.html"><ins>weird buttons from Amazon</ins></a> that would complete a purchase with a simple press?

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cute, alien-inspired companion <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/the-robots-we-saw-at-ces-2025-the-good-the-bad-and-the-completely-unhinged-174529774.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">robots are a fixture at CES</a>, but have I ever seen one with a furry telescoping neck that&#39;s also warm to the touch? No, I can&#39;t say I have before this year. OlloBot — which had possibly the cutest booth at CES 2026 — is a home robot and &quot;cyber pet&quot; that looks something like if you put ET&#39;s head on a penguin&#39;s body, plus a splash of fur and color.&nbsp;</p><p>Its face is essentially a large tablet that displays its expressions, pictures and videos, and allows it to communicate with people in the home. OlloBot speaks its own language, but will put text on the screen when it has a message that&#39;s meant to actually be understood. There&#39;s also a companion app where family members can message with the robot, see its diary updates and play games. Like other family-oriented robots, OlloBot is designed to capture special moments and &quot;grow&quot; with the people using it. </p><div><div><div id="c2df2a6ac9934af1b0d17dcdce6bc7fd"><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/NuaS1RUL?app=1" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Based on the interactions, it will over time develop a personality based on the Meyers-Briggs personality types. The robot responds to voice and touch, and can do tasks like make calls and help find lost objects. It will be able to control Matter-compatible smart home devices, too.&nbsp;All data is stored locally in a heart-shaped removable module underneath one of its flapping arms. Not only is that intended to be a privacy move, but if the robot ever breaks, the family&#39;s cyber pet (along with its &quot;memories&quot;) can be restored by putting the old heart into a new body.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/heart.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/heart.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A hand is seen lifting OlloBot&#39;s arm to reveal a red heart underneath, which serves as a removable module that contains its data" data-uuid="2d9974d9-8466-4c00-8260-e2d33cd1c7ae"><figcaption>OlloBot&#39;s heart</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p>According to a member of the OlloBot team, a Kickstarter campaign to fund the robot&#39;s production is planned for this summer. There will be two versions of OlloBot to choose from: a small one with a fixed, short neck that will cost around $1,000 and a more advanced model that can extend its neck by two feet or so (just eyeballing it) to see from different vantage points, which will run you about $2,000. At the booth, the team also showed off several outfits for OlloBot, including a plush giraffe suit and a sort of cottagecore apple and gingham outfit.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html?src=rss]]></description>

The companion SmartThings Find app is easy to use, showing locations on a Google Maps-based interface. Much like Apple&#39;s Find My network, the location of a SmartTag is pinpointed using nearby Samsung phones. While nothing can beat the sheer size of Apple&#39;s tracking infrastructure given the number of iPhones in the US, it still worked well in our tests.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The SmartTag 2&#39;s design is more practical than some competitors since the oblong fob has a built-in hole that lets you easily attach your keys without buying an extra accessory. It’s IP67 rated for water and dust resistance, and uses a replaceable battery that Samsung says offers about 16 months of juice. The volume on the tag is pretty loud and users can select from multiple ringtones. Additionally, a double-squeeze of the SmartTag 2 will ping your handset, something you can&#39;t do with an AirTag.</p> 
<p>The tracking is not quite as precise as Apple&#39;s AirTag, but it&#39;s a solid option for Samsung users looking to keep track of their things and can be scooped up at a bargain price.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever bought a bag of spinach only to come home and realize you already had a bag of spinach, you may appreciate this fridge. I had a chance to check out the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ge-appliances-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326073.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">GE Profile Smart Fridge</a> with Kitchen Assistant <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">at CES</a> and was surprised to find I kinda wanted one. To be perfectly honest, most attempts I’ve seen at the show to “stick some AI in it” are at best amusing but usually completely unnecessary. </p>
<p>Here, though, the AI has a purpose. After seeing how the autofill water dispenser worked, I asked the GE Appliance reps how easy it was to change the fridge’s water filter. Jason May, a GE Appliances product management executive, walked up to the fridge’s (appropriately sized) touchscreen and said “Hey HQ, where’s my water filter?” (HQ is short for SmartHQ, GE Profile’s assistant). Then, relying on information it had gathered from this model’s user manual, the AI assistant explained exactly where to find it (in the left hand door below the ice maker). It took another rep about two seconds to pop out the filter and, justlikethat, the task was on its way to done. </p>
<p>As for the spinach conundrum, that’s handled by a crisper drawer camera, called Fridge Focus. Each time you open the drawers, a built-in camera (that you can physically shutter or turn off in the app) takes a video snapshot of what’s left when you’re done. So if you’re at the store and wondering how much kale you already have, you can take a peek and see. </p>

<p>Wendy Treinen, GE Appliances’ senior director of product communications, told me the camera can see what’s in the crisper drawer, but can’t see who accessed it. So if you’re hoping your fridge will rat out whoever at the last of the grapes, you’re out of luck. It can however, help that grape-eater easily add more fruit to the family shopping list. </p>
<p>That’s the most unique feature the fridge offers: a patented, built-in barcode scanner. It lives in the water dispenser and when you walk up, a little green light activates and scans the barcode of whatever you hold up to it. So if you’re drinking the last of the almond milk, you scan the container and it’ll automatically add it to your list. </p>
<p>That list can be accessed through the SmartHQ app which you can either check off at the grocery store or, if you really want to get deluxe about it, use the Instacart integration and have it delivered to your door. I scanned a few products — a box of vitamin C mix and a package of cinnamon raisin bagels — both of which quickly popped up on the screen and joined the running list. </p>

<p>The scanner can recognize four million products, including household items like paper towels and trash bags, but you can add things a other ways too. The easiest is probably just asking your fridge to do so, saying “Hey HQ, add paper towels to my shopping list.” The app allows manual additions and you can add items using the recipe function as well. </p>
<p>For the launch of the fridge, GE Profile has partnered with Taste of Home and will send 50 recipes each month to the fridge for users to try. Once you see the ingredients list, you can add anything you’re missing to your shopping. Those 50 recipes will cycle out at the end of the month to make way for a new 50, so if you cook something and like it, you’ll need to to add it to your personal recipe vault. </p>
<p>The AI assistant can also create recipes for you. The GE rep snapped a picture of an array of produce and asked SmartHQ what he could make with it. A list of recipe suggestions popped up and they all looked quite tasty (to be fair, I hadn’t eaten yet and it was already 2PM). </p>

<p>I mentioned the water dispenser’s hands-free auto-fill feature earlier. That’s been available on GE Profile fridges for a while and lets you select your glass capacity and walk away while it fills. You can also ask for, say, a half cup of water for a recipe. A new “precise fill” feature will dispense larger amounts in sequence. Say you need ten cups of water for soup. Since you can’t fit a huge vat in the water dispenser tray, you can instead use a smaller jug and the auto-filler will fill it the correct amount of times. </p>
<p>Another of my favorite bits is the screen. Fridges with giant, interactive screens make my eyes roll. Yes, it’s novel and eye-catching and perhaps amusing, but what possible problem is it trying to solve? The screen here is eight inches, which is enough to display scanned items, show recipes, and display the weather atop a pretty image when you’re not actively using the interface. </p>

<p>The GE Appliances reps were eager to point out that this is just the beginning of what they want to do with the fridge. My college Sam Rutherford asked whether the fridge would be able to alert you before your lettuce went bad, and we were told something that addresses that problem is on the horizon. It would likely work by recognizing when you purchased a perishable, and how long that perishable typically lasts. The company is also working with a chef on a feature that can reimagine your leftovers to create something new. </p>
<p>During the demo, May told me that the whole idea around the fridge’s design was to do something other than just “put a big screen on it with a bunch of apps that don’t have ay relevance to anything.” Instead the engineers started with problems people actually have — knowing what to buy at the store, knowing what’s already in the fridge, answering the eternal, unrelenting “What’s for dinner?” question — and designed the fridge around that. </p>
<p>I’d have to live with it a while to know whether those problems were solved, but so far, I can say this is the most intrigued I’ve felt about a smart fridge yet. The GE Profile Smart Fridge with Kitchen Assistant will be available in March from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6efa3bd-7e88-4c77-b015-37f6878ef85a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=db978eac-7f71-4bf4-9e8d-cb69745a0108&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GE+Appliances+Parts&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vZ2VhcHBsaWFuY2VzLmNvbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGI5NzhlYWMtN2Y3MS00YmY0LTllOGQtY2I2OTc0NWEwMTA4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vZ2VhcHBsaWFuY2VzLmNvbSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdjJY6bOEIM3Gw6Ubf_kBIdI7nVXdvWOepIIl5rMjB82&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fgeappliances.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:GE Appliances Parts;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="http://geappliances.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">geappliances.com</a> for $4,899. </p>

We <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-killing-the-xps-name-is-an-unforced-error-200006195.html" data-i13n="slk:said so;cpos:2;pos:1">said so</a>, in fact, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html" data-i13n="slk:multiple;cpos:3;pos:1">multiple</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html" data-i13n="slk:times;cpos:4;pos:1">times</a>. But at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company is righting its past wrongs by resurrecting the iconic laptop brand — and this time, this decision feels like the right move both for Dell as a whole and its flagship consumer devices.</p><p>Even more than the words the letters XPS are meant to represent (Extreme Performance Systems), over the last decade, Dell’s signature laptop brand stood for excellent design, quality engineering and top notch performance. And it was precisely those laptops that landed the company at the top of nearly every best Windows laptop guide every year for the last decade. So to replace XPS with a generic tag like premium felt like a big step backwards.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Now if you were living under a rock (at least when it comes to Windows laptops), you can sort of squint your eyes and see the reasoning behind Dell’s misguided rebranding. Premium means good, typically something much better than average. By putting that word in front of its top-tier systems, there’s no way anyone could be confused about what kind of device they were buying, right? Take for example the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Dell Premium 14</a>, which was the new moniker for what was previously called the XPS 14. A laptop like that has to be decent. I mean, it’s right there in the product name. The issue is that XPS already meant good. Actually, way better than that, if we were just going by the sheer number of accolades previous-gen models got, like Dell’s 2020-era machines which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">we called practically perfect</a> (which it was). Going away from that wasn’t just reductive, it was throwing the best part of Dell’s consumer business in the trash for no real reason.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The first two new XPS machines will be the XPS 14 and XPS 16.

COO Jeff Clarke was refreshingly honest about this when announcing the return of XPS at a CES media preview in early December. Not only did Dell lose its signature XPS brand last year, it actually made things more confusing for consumers when it simultaneously created a full range of Dell Pro and Pro Max systems. Unlike Apple’s MacBook Pros and iPhone Pro Maxes, those devices were actually meant for enterprise customers instead of regular Joes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-14-and-16-2.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Another photo of the new XPS 14 and 16, which have a bunch of welcome changes and then some.

That left a lot of people turning to more <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-16-plus-2-in-1-review-technically-proficient-but-lacking-soul-153003908.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">expensive mid-range “Plus” systems</a> or waiting for a proper redesign of its top tier Premium laptops, which weren’t expected to arrive until 2026 anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>So where is Dell going from here? Well as Clarke put it quite succinctly, “We’re getting back to our roots.” Starting in 2026, the company is planning to create its broadest PC portfolio ever including, a full line of XPS laptops. This includes an all-new version of the XPS 13, which is going to be the thinnest and lightest model to date, along with complete overhauls for the XPS 14 and XPS 16. But Dell isn’t stopping there because on a slide it showed at its press event, there were two additional placeholders for future XPS systems coming at some later date.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-13-teaser-pic.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XPS-13-teaser-pic.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Dell wouldn&#39;t let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here&#39;s a teaser it provided for CES.

Dell isn’t just bringing the XPS line back, it’s kind of on a revenge tour (even if the original wound was self-inflicted).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the consumer device team will be reporting directly to Clarke while the company retools itself internally. Dell is also updating its naming scheme to finally deliver on the promise of making things clear and simple. XPS will once again be the company’s flagship consumer brand with the XPS logo (not Dell’s) front and center on the lid of every laptop, while everything else will fall under the general Dell umbrella. Alienware will continue to do its own thing for gaming and the Dell Pro family will remain aimed strictly at enterprise businesses, professional services (like first responders) and education. No more confusion. And underlying all of that is a very straightforward motto from Clarke that “great products win.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EMBARGOED_UNTIL_JAN._5_%40_3pm_PT_-_Dell_Technologies_Branding_Snapshot.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EMBARGOED_UNTIL_JAN._5_%40_3pm_PT_-_Dell_Technologies_Branding_Snapshot.png" style="height:622px;width:1216px;" alt="After ditching the XPS brand, Dell is now bring it back for 2026 in its rightful spot at the top of the company&#39;s consumer portfolio.

Regardless of whether it&#39;s a corporation or a single person, admitting mistakes is always hard. Oftentimes, what you learn in the process is the real prize and from what I’ve seen Dell and its iconic XPS line is poised for a major comeback.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-in-2026-233248065.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Star Trek is in a weird place right now. Less than three years ago we were living in a golden age with five shows on the air, all with different styles and intended audiences.&nbsp; But the universe rapidly contracted, with <em>Picard</em> ending while four other shows were cut short. <em>Strange New Worlds</em> still has another two seasons left, sure, but even that final season got truncated. As it stands, there’s only one project with a firm future right now, and that’s a brand-new show, <em>Starfleet Academy</em>, premiering January 15 on Paramount+.</p><p>How this show is received could very well determine the future of Star Trek. That’s a lot to put on it, but there’s something very appropriate given the subject matter. <em>Starfleet Academy</em> takes place in the 32nd century, 900 years after the adventures of James T. Kirk and company, and it takes place at the titular academy, meaning its principal cast is a collection of teens representing the next generation of Starfleet officers. That focus on a younger cadre has led to fans online derisively calling the series “CW Trek” without seeing a single episode.&nbsp;</p><p>As <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is technically a <em>Discovery</em> spinoff, it picks up some of that series’ traits. The sleek, shiny sets are back, as well as a few plot threads originally set up in <em>Discovery</em>. The most notable is the collapse of the United Federation of Planets and the rebuilding of both the Federation and Starfleet. In fact, the series picks up on that as early as its second episode, with the Academy hosting a delegation from a once stalwart Federation planet that’s now gone isolationist.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_102_BP_1004_0320_RT_7636.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_102_BP_1004_0320_RT_7636.jpg" style="height:1843px;width:3000px;" alt="Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy" data-uuid="650975dd-226c-4232-9b2d-37029eaa2a5d"/><figcaption>Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Medland/Paramount+</div></figure><p>While many complaints about the series have focused on how what fans wanted was an academy show set during the 24th century (the time of <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, et al.), this particular episode plot works precisely because of the distant future in which it is set. In a fully-functioning galactic democracy like the United Federation of Planets, there’s no logical reason for the average 18-year-old college freshman to be involved in interplanetary diplomacy. But in the 32nd century, the Federation is a lot scrappier and the individuals involved might be asked to wear many hats. It’s a lot like an early-stage tech startup.</p><p>The setting also lets the show be a little more creative with its cast: where TNG featured the first Klingon in Starfleet (Worf), 900 years of progress have created a Starfleet where no one bats an eye when a Klingon cadet like Jay-Den Kraag (played by Karim Diané) shows up to study science. There’s also a holographic cadet, Sam, who is the first of her kind to attend the academy (and she’s super excited to do so). A few new species are present as well: Darem Reymi (George Hawkins) is a Khionian and Genesis Lythe (Bella Shepard) is a Dar-Sha, both aliens making their debut in the Star Trek universe.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_JM_1030_2840_RT.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_JM_1030_2840_RT.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3000px;" alt="The cast of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy" data-uuid="dd590b7e-1c99-450d-a706-963a16e6e80c"/><figcaption>The cast of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Medland/Paramount+</div></figure><p>However, the show does still lean on some Trek stalwarts, and it’s these characters that have gotten the most chatter from fans. Mary Weisman as Sylvia Tilly was originally slated for the cast, and there was even a backdoor pilot-esque episode of <em>Discovery</em> to tie her in to the new show, but she’s no longer a regular and is nowhere to be seen in the first two episodes. Instead, we have Jett Reno (played by the wonderful Tig Notaro) as supporting cast, and Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) appearing in a few episodes. And old school fans have been abuzz by the inclusion of The Doctor, who first appeared on <em>Voyager</em> (and later <em>Prodigy</em>). As a hologram, he’s practically immortal so his presence doesn’t need any convoluted explanation, and after 800 years he’s still the same gregarious blowhard (and it’s delightful).</p><p>They’re joined by new characters like Lara Thok, a part Klingon, part Jem’Hadar security officer and a Lanthanite chancellor, Nahla Ake, played by Academy Award Winner Holly Hunter. And Hunter isn’t even the only Oscar winner on the cast, with a major villain, Nus Braka, being portrayed by Paul Giamatti.</p><p>It’s a stellar cast, and the show’s sets certainly rise up to meet the challenge. Like in the shows of old, a good portion of <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is clearly shot on location, though not in the familiar water reclamation plant that was used back during the TNG and DS9 era. This time it’s all being shot in Ontario, with the outdoor scenes in particular being filmed in Waterloo. Regardless of where it’s shot, it looks enough like sunny California to work.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_BP_1029_0373_RT.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SFA_103_BP_1029_0373_RT.jpg" style="height:1924px;width:3000px;" alt="Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy" data-uuid="d9d7bb22-2bc8-4dbc-a251-945868cb5dc9"/><figcaption>Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Medland/Paramount+</div></figure><p>The indoor scenes, shot at Toronto’s Pinewood Studios, have a pleasant convention center quality to them, with lots of wide hallways and large windows in contrast to <em>Discovery</em>’s cramped ship corridors. The hallways are full of students and teachers going to and fro, including some from species that would normally be off-limits to a show with a limited budget. But here robots and strange aliens roam freely in the background. The CGI can’t have been cheap.</p><p>And that’s ultimately my biggest question about <em>Starfleet Academy</em>. Exactly how much is this costing Paramount? So much of it is being shot on real sets instead of green screens, established actors like Hunter and Giamatti couldn’t have been cheap, and plentiful CG points to a robust special effects budget. Though Paramount doesn’t release official numbers, estimates have put an average episode of <em>Strange New Worlds</em> at $10 million, so it figures that <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is probably more than that, with some online estimates as high as $20 million per episode.&nbsp;</p><p>With 10 episodes scheduled, that’s on par with a major motion picture budget but without the promise of blockbuster box office returns. No wonder Paramount has been doing so much cost-cutting, which includes axing every other Star Trek show.</p><p>That said, <em>Starfleet Academy</em> is carrying a lot on its shoulders. Just as the success or failure of its class of Starfleet cadets will determine the future of Starfleet and the Federation, the success of the show may even affect whether this era of Star Trek continues. As a Star Trek fan, this can be nerve-wracking; no one wants the franchise to go dormant again. But <em>Starfleet Academy</em> has so far shown itself to be up to the challenge.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/star-trek-starfleet-academy-deftly-balances-teen-drama-with-intergalactic-intrigue-170253808.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bose recently announced the pending end of cloud support for its SoundTouch line of home speakers. This will, in effect, turn the smart speakers into dumb speakers as they will no longer have access to many features and any related software updates. Well, there&#39;s a spot of good news for SoundTouch owners. The company is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Bose;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da41807c-aae5-49ff-b905-2c3f70122c64&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=97a836d0-b0d0-46bf-abba-948281d008ca&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bose&amp;linkText=turning+to+an+open+source+model&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3NlLmNvbS9zb3VuZHRvdWNoLWVuZC1vZi1saWZlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5N2E4MzZkMC1iMGQwLTQ2YmYtYWJiYS05NDgyODFkMDA4Y2EiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc2UuY29tL3NvdW5kdG91Y2gtZW5kLW9mLWxpZmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATB5RWONWOJxCMXLkvA0NWbSPyQXzjZ5iaa5kCKPo0HO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fsoundtouch-end-of-life" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life">turning to an open source model</a> for the software, allowing third parties to keep the music playing.</p>
<p>The company has already begun mailing out the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025.12.18-SoundTouch-Web-API.pdf">API documentation</a> to customers so &quot;independent developers can create their own SoundTouch-compatible tools and features.&quot; This will take some time, so Bose is also extending the end-of-life (EoL) date for the SoundTouch speakers. They were set to stop receiving cloud updates in February, but that has been moved to May 6.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It made a couple of other changes to make life a bit easier for SoundTouch owners. The speakers will still be able to use AirPlay and Spotify Connect after EoL, which was something that had been in doubt. The app will also continue to work in a stripped-down format. That app was originally set to stop working altogether, so all of those <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o2cnhw/bose_ending_cloud_support_for_soundtouch/">angry customer comments</a> on Reddit <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/1o2db0f/comment/niqj66d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">must have done the job</a>.</p>
<p>The SoundTouch speakers <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-10-bose-soundtouch-wifi-music-systems.html">were introduced in 2013</a> and were on the expensive side, starting at $600. Nobody likes spending hundreds of dollars on something only to have it become a useless brick several years later. Good on Bose for listening to their customers on this.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/bose-made-the-consumer-friendly-move-to-open-source-its-soundtouch-speakers-163459024.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company launched an ultrawide, curved 52-inch 6K monitor at the show this year, a productivity behemoth designed for stock traders, engineers and other professionals. Dell claims the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the first 52-incher to market that’s also ultrawide, curved and supports 6K resolution (but with that many qualifiers almost anything can be a world first).</p><p>Given Dell’s experience in the monitor realm, this could be a dream display for professionals who handle vast data sets such as trading platforms, AutoCAD, 3D rendering software, spreadsheets and more. It sports a 120Hz refresh rate on an IPS Black panel and emits up to 60 percent less blue light when compared to competing monitors. It delivers an impressive 129 ppi (for comparison a 4K 32-inch monitor delivers 138 ppi) and an ambient light sensor helps avoid eye strain during long work sessions.</p><p>Users can connect up to four PCs to the monitor simultaneously, which can use picture-by-picture to treat each partitioned screen as an individual monitor. It also features built-in KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) features that let users control all connected PCs via a single mouse and keyboard. The monitor can also charge your laptop with up to 140W of power via a Thunderbolt 4 connection.</p><p>Dell also rolled out a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with support for both True Black 500 HDR and Dolby Vision. It claims true-to-life color accuracy out of the box and excellent gamut coverage at 99 percent of DCI-P3. This monitor would be a strong fit for film and photo editing.</p><p>The Dell UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is priced at $2,900 with stand or $2,800 without. It will be widely available starting January 6. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor comes in at $2,600 and will be available beginning February 24.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-unveils-a-massive-52-inch-6k-ultrawide-curved-monitor-at-ces-2026-140024842.html?src=rss]]></description>

The new display tech splits up the yellow layer of the company&#39;s 3rd-gen OLED tech into distinct red and green layers that, when stacked with blue layers, create brighter, more energy-efficient screens.</p><p>In the case of the UltraGear GX7, the new 27-inch monitor reaches a typical brightness of 335 nits, and is VES DisplayHDR True Black 500 certified, for deeper contrast between the dark and bright parts of the screen. LG touts the display&#39;s Dual Mode, which lets discerning gamers switch between two distinct settings: a 540Hz refresh rate mode at QHD resolution, when image quality is what you care about most, or a 720Hz refresh rate mode at HD resolution, when speed is your priority.</p><p>Whichever mode you choose, LG promises the monitor will offer a smooth and stutter free experience.

Like Asus, MSI is mixing different OLED display technologies for better results. This new monitor uses a 5th-gen Tandem QD-OLED panel with an &quot;RGB Stripe sub-pixel layout&quot; for sharper visuals. MSI also applies what it calls &quot;DarkArmor Film&quot; to &quot;enhance light absorption,&quot; eliminate the reddish tint some QD-OLED panels have under ambient light, and boost black levels by &quot;up to 40 percent.&quot;</p><p>As an ultrawide, the MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36 has a resolution of 3,440 x 1,440, an aspect ratio of 21:9 and a refresh rate of 360Hz. MSI says the monitor can reach a peak brightness of 1,300 nits, and the company provides multiple HDR modes to switch between depending on your needs. Similar to ASUS, the monitor also includes a sensor for detecting whether a human is in front of the screen – MSI calls it an AI Care Sensor – so that the monitor can power-off or enter standby mode when not in active use.</p><h2 id="jump-link-viewsonic-vx2738-2k-oled-gaming-monitor">ViewSonic VX2738 2K OLED Gaming Monitor</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VX2738-2K-OLED.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VX2738-2K-OLED.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="ViewSonic&#39;s new 24-inch OLED monitor." data-uuid="e41bc635-7515-4bfa-b480-bd8e66e17e91"><figcaption>ViewSonic&#39;s new 24-inch OLED monitor.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ViewSonic</div></figure><p>ViewSonic&#39;s new gaming monitors are more approachable and (presumably) more affordable than the options from competitors, but not necessarily less performant.

The new controllers are now on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-l-r-light-purple-light-green-127067/">pre-order for $100</a> and include matching wrist-straps.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="89e8446f139a4dfba80cffa7aa2a0474" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-l-r-light-purple-light-green-127067/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Other than the colorway, these are standard Joy-Con 2 controllers with motion controls and HD rumble, along with the C Button for GameChat and the mouse controls for compatible games. However, you may have noticed something weird about them — the colors are on the inner rails, so you&#39;ll barely be able to see them when the Joy-Con 2s are connected to a Switch 2 console, except around the thumbsticks. By contrast, previous <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-kicks-off-the-summer-with-pastel-hued-joy-con-controllers-141002133.html">Joy-Con </a><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-kicks-off-the-summer-with-pastel-hued-joy-con-controllers-141002133.html">color variants</a> covered the entire shell. The new Switch 2 Joy-Con colors also clash with the light blue and orange strips on the inner left and right of the console.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Along with the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, Nintendo released a lengthy game-play video for Mario Tennis Fever, also set to arrive on February 12th. It details some of the key gameplay features, like &quot;fever shots,&quot; the ice racket and moves like slides and dives.&nbsp;</p>

The statement is even more true if you have a Pixel phone. If you&#39;re on the market for a new pair, you can grab the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $165 in the hazel colorway, which is $54 off their usual price. Other color options are also discounted, just not as steeply.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The device made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a>, and this is particularly true for those tied into the Pixel ecosystem. These earbuds are on the smaller side and, more importantly, comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They also manage to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/pixel-buds-pro-2-review-tiny-earbuds-with-big-sound-and-a-direct-line-to-gemini-170016328.html">deliver pristine audio</a>, as we were fans of the punchy bass, full mids and crisp highs on offer.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The battery lasts for 30 hours when you include return trips to the charging case, at around eight hours a pop. They offer multipoint Bluetooth that switches between audio sources with just a single button press. There&#39;s an app for keeping an eye on battery levels and ANC levels.</p> 
<p>The primary downside when these were first released was the high price tag, which has been alleviated by this sale. Beyond that, there&#39;s really just one nitpick. Smaller earbuds translate to a smaller touch panel, which requires precision to operate.</p>

This is marked down from $250, a hefty 20 percent discount. This model was just released in September of last year, so consider this a substantial discount for such a recent product.</p>

 <core-commerce id="9d2a9c264099463ba10d3ed1a8a4d49b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We gave these AirPods a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html"><ins>review</ins></a> and we consider them the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html"><ins>best wireless earbuds for iPhone</ins></a> users. The third generation model is a substantial update to an already impressive product, bringing new features like live translation to the table.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 also offer heart-rate tracking, allowing them to stream live data to Apple Fitness and other third-party workout apps. This lets you track your fitness and close activity rings similarly to when using an Apple Watch.</p> 
<p>Apple also improved the sound quality of this generation thanks in large part to a redesigned acoustic architecture that improves how air is delivered into the ear canal. Additionally, the company changed the angle of the drivers to help more sound get where it needs to go instead of bouncing off the sides of your ear. We felt the jump in audio quality from the last generation to this one was substantial.</p> 
<p>The ANC on the AirPods Pro 3 has also been improved. Apple claims this model filters out twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. We found the noise cancellation to be top-notch.</p> 
<p>Live Translation is as neat as it sounds, leveraging the AirPods&#39; noise cancellation tech, Apple&#39;s AI and beamforming mics to help you understand a speaker in a different language. Right now, this is limited to a handful of languages with more being added over time.</p> 
<p>It&#39;s not often you see one of Apple&#39;s best and most recent products on sale for 20 percent off, so if you&#39;re in the market for an upgrade or your first set of AirPods, consider taking advantage of this deal.</p>

The Smart Brick, combined with Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, responds dynamically to movement, proximity and context, triggering sounds and interactions without screens or apps. Seeing kids physically act out Star Wars battles while the bricks reacted in real time made it clear this is designed first and foremost for active social play, not digital distraction.</p><h2 id="jump-link-wheelmove">WheelMove</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WheelMove.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WheelMove.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground" data-uuid="6de563c8-09a1-48d9-b84b-34979a029fd9"/><figcaption>A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">WheelMove’s motorized wheelchair attachment</a> is compact, surprisingly quick to install and genuinely empowering in action. The add-on lifts a chair’s front wheels and adds powered assistance, making grass, cobblestones and slopes far easier to navigate.

Using computer vision to analyze bowel movements and urination, the device aims to establish a personal baseline and flag changes over time, with gut health and GLP-1 users firmly in mind. It’s too early to judge accuracy, but seeing it in person made it feel less gimmicky and more like a niche wellness tool worth testing.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ikea-smart-home-gear">IKEA smart home gear</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_donut_lamp.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_donut_lamp.jpg" style="height:1807px;width:3213px;" alt="The popular VARMBLIXT donut lamp is now smart.

You can pick one up for only $16, and it&#39;s available in two- and four-packs as well at a discount.</p> 
<p>The TimeCapsule case uses two AA batteries to offer up to 14 times the lifespan of the CR2032 battery that powers an AirTag. The company based those estimates on Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, so your mileage may vary. Once an AirTag is seated inside the case, which is a compact 4.45 x 1.57 inches, it is sealed shut with four screws at the corners. The case is fiber-reinforced, according to Elevation Lab, and rated IP69 waterproof.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a launch later this month, Volvo has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/media/images/ca4cd727e9c5475c9f59b3cb0108c259/">teased</a> some impressive details about its upcoming electric crossover. The EX60, which slots between the EX40 and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvos-ex90-suv-was-mostly-worth-the-wait-153035616.html">EX90</a>, will offer an EPA range of 400 miles, beating all other Volvos and most EVs in general. It will also be the first Volvo car to use a megacasting process designed to reduce weight and boost manufacturing efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car,&quot; said Volvo CTO Anders Bell. &quot;The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a59882d0-ec80-11f0-a9f7-2f5506db2938" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a59882d0-ec80-11f0-a9f7-2f5506db2938" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Volvo EX60 Electric crossover" data-uuid="f9ec65c5-11b7-30f8-b2ae-12005b1b3c79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure>
<p>Volvo considered that main worry to be range anxiety, so it focused on maximizing endurance to the largest extent possible. Key to that is Volvo&#39;s advanced SPA3 EV architecture, which integrates the battery directly into the structure of the car with cell-to-body technology. Volvo also developed its e-motors in-house to improve efficiency and reduce weight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company also made the EX60 fast to charge with an 800-volt electrical system and support for up to 400kW fast charging, letting you add up to 168 miles of range in just 10 minutes. New lighter materials and lower heat generation aid in that, &quot;meaning the EX60 can add over 100 miles or range in just a few minutes,&quot; Volvo wrote on its blog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The megacasting, meanwhile, helped Volvo replace hundreds of smaller parts with a single, high-precision casting to reduce weight. The Volvo EX60 will be revealed on January 21, 2026 at a livestream on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/news/articles/ex60-reveal-livestream/">Volvo&#39;s website</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvos-ex60-electric-crossover-promises-400-miles-of-epa-range-130008964.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a move that should surprise nobody, Google is stuffing more Gemini AI into Gmail. A host of new features, some of which are already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/personalized-ai-powered-smart-replies-are-coming-to-gmail-172422777.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">familiar to Workspace users</a>, are rolling out today for Gmail users in the US. Some are free, while others require a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html" data-i13n="slk:Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription;cpos:2;pos:1">Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription</a>.</p><p>The first premium feature is AI Overviews, the same name as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/15-billion-people-see-googles-ai-overviews-each-month-174526822.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a similar feature in Google Search</a>. Gmail’s version lets you ask questions about your messages in the search bar, using natural language. Google uses the example of, &quot;Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?&quot; It’s hard to imagine that saving much time over a basic search for &quot;plumber quote&quot; or “plumbing estimate,” but maybe it could help in some situations.</p><p>There&#39;s also a free portion of AI Overviews that summarizes mail threads for easy catch-ups. However, the ability to ask your inbox questions requires a subscription.</p><p>Meanwhile, Proofread is a subscription-only feature that&#39;s essentially <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/grammarlys-ai-writing-assistance-tools-now-work-in-five-new-languages-180432231.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Grammarly</a> for Gmail. As you&#39;d guess, it suggests improvements in grammar, word choice, conciseness, voice and sentence structure.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Gmail_AI_Inbox_Image.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Gmail_AI_Inbox_Image.png" style="height:720px;width:1280px;" alt="Google marketing image for an AI catch-up feature coming to Gmail." data-uuid="f6451048-d870-4f11-bdea-769dc3219221"/><figcaption>AI Inbox</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Finally, there&#39;s the AI Inbox, a feature that &quot;filters out the clutter so you can focus on what&#39;s most important.&quot; Google says it&#39;s like a personal briefing that flags to-dos and catches you up on what it thinks is most important. (It identifies VIPs based on frequent contacts, your contact list, and inferred relationships.) The company claims, without adding further detail, that this all &quot;happens securely with the privacy protections you expect from Google.&quot; AI Inbox is another subscription-only feature.</p><p>Now onto the free stuff. Help Me Write is a tool for all Gmail users that generates email copy from a prompt. This kind of thing should be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/proton-mail-now-has-a-privacy-focused-ai-writing-assistant-155816223.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">well-familiar by now</a>, as Big Tech increasingly encourages users to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/whatsapp-is-the-latest-to-offer-an-ai-powered-writing-assistant-182116369.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">avoid drafting anything from scratch</a>. And Suggested Replies can draft replies for you that mimic your tone and style. (Google describes it as a next-gen version of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-launches-geminis-contextual-smart-replies-in-gmail-140021232.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Smart Replies</a>.) Help Me Write and Suggested Replies are rolling out to everyone (no subscription required) today.</p><p>The new Gemini-powered features begin rolling out to Gmail today. Although they&#39;re starting with English speakers in the US, Google says they&#39;ll arrive in more languages and regions &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gmail-is-getting-a-gemini-ai-overhaul-130000422.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-redesigned-disney-app-is-rolling-out-to-more-users-in-the-us-204759533.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Disney+</a> will add vertical videos to its service in the US sometime this year, in hopes that they can entice viewers to engage with its app every day. The company has made the announcement at its Tech + Data Showcase event at CES 2026. Disney first dabbled in vertical content with Verts, which launched for the ESPN app in August 2025, giving it the insight it needed on how its users respond to the video format. </p><p>Erin Teague, Disney Entertainment’s EVP of Product Management, told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/disney-plus-vertical-videos-ces-1236665836/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> that the company will use the format for all kinds of content. The service isn’t just planning to use it as a vehicle for movie and series teasers, but also for original short-form programming. She didn’t say what kinds of original programming Disney+ will be adding as vertical videos to its app, but vertical micro-dramas have become incredibly popular over the past year. </p><p>“We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Teague said. “So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience.” The company is targeting Gen Z and Gen Alpha users, in particular, since they’re not inclined to sit and watch long-form content on their phones for hours. Disney said in a statement that the experience will “evolve as it&nbsp;expands across news and entertainment” and will be personalized for users, with making the service “a must-visit daily destination” as its goal. After all, if a user is already in the app, they’re more likely to explore and watch the service’s programming. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-is-launching-vertical-videos-this-year-120000776.html?src=rss]]></description>

After the planned <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html" data-i13n="slk:summer 2025 release window;cpos:2;pos:1">summer 2025 release window</a> came and went, the company has opted not to release the gizmo as a consumer product, at least not for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-s-rolling-ballie-robot-indefinitely-shelved-after-delays" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Samsung has &quot;indefinitely shelved&quot; the robot. A spokesperson told the publication that the company will keep Ballie around as an &quot;active innovation platform&quot; internally. &quot;After multiple years of real-world testing, it continues to inform how Samsung designs spatially aware, context-driven experiences, particularly in areas like smart home intelligence, ambient AI and privacy-by-design,&quot; the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGDF5R20tkM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>There’s a sliver of a chance that Samsung will eventually bring Ballie to market, but that seems unlikely as things stand. So, six years after we <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-ballie-ces-2020/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">first clapped eyes on the robot at CES 2020</a>, (and two years after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-ballie-robot-ball-showed-up-at-ces-2024-with-a-new-look-and-a-built-in-projector-224231693.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a redesigned larger version</a> debuted), it appears to be doomed as a consumer device.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a bit of a shame, as Ballie seemed like a fun gadget. In fairness to Samsung, companies are now likely having to be more judicious about what products — especially more experimental ones — go into full production amid <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsung-says-ram-costs-will-likely-lead-to-price-hikes-soon-170653524.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">rising costs of things like RAM</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/you-wont-be-able-to-buy-samsungs-household-ballie-robot-after-all-104529942.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past year or two to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> 
<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> 
<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-writing-and-latency">Writing and latency</h3> 
<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading">Reading</h3> 
<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> 
<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> 
<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-search-functionality">Search functionality</h3> 
<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> 
<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity">Sharing and connectivity</h3> 
<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> 
<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> 
<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to &quot;increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: &quot;We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We&#39;ve communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> 
<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that&#39;s for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn&#39;t great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It&#39;s also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p>

The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> 
<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html">Smart Paper</a>, but it&#39;s too pricey and too married to the company&#39;s companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn&#39;t as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo&#39;s cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=57f41413-eec2-4d90-9c25-26d144b737b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Boox+Tab+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shop.boox.com/products/tab">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss]]></description>

The new accessories include improved visual interfaces, faster Qi2 wireless charging and “upgraded ecosystems” that support the latest iPhones. Some of the latest devices are even available to buy right now.</p>
<p>First up is the Anker Nano Charger with smart display, which features a tiny screen, 180-degree foldable prongs and provides up to 45W of power. The plug can identify the exact iPhone model connected and then deliver the right amount of power for your phone. Anker says the Nano uses three-stage power delivery and a "Care Mode" that the company claims keeps batteries cooler than some competing 45W chargers. It arrives in late January 2026 and will retail for $40.</p>
<p>For fans of wireless charging stations, the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station offers a 3-in-1 solution for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. It uses a "AirCool" system for "faster, safer performance" and offers up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. The design is also foldable for compact travel. It's set for release in Q1 2026 and will retail for $150.</p>
<p>The company debuted a clamp-on 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip with 70W of output and built-in surge protection. It sports two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and six AC outlets. The Nano Power Strip is getting a late January release, and it will sell for $70.</p>
<p>Anker also unveiled a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station. This serves as an all-in-one hub with support for up to three displays (with 4K resolution supported on a single display), up to 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between connected devices. It also features a removable 6-in-1 hub with SD and microSD card readers, a USB-A port and a 5 Gbps USB-C port. The Nano Docking Station is available now and retails for $150.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every fall, dozens of maple and oak trees in my neighborhood shed their leaves. Thus begins the constant drone of gas-powered leaf blowers every day through early December. The noise is by far the most annoying thing about these yard tools, but I can appreciate it’s a necessary evil — unless you prefer to pick up a blister-inducing rake. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.whisper.aero/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Whisper Aero</a> argues there’s a better way. The company is using aerospace tech to quiet the noisy devices, introducing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://toneoutdoors.com/products/t1" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the T1</a> leaf blower <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">at CES 2026</a> under its sub-brand Tone Outdoors. The company promises the T1 is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading” handheld gas leaf blowers. More specifically, the T1 has 880 CFM of air flow, which easily surpasses my battery-powered EGO. And at 52 decibels of average noise at peak volume, his model is drastically quieter than any leaf blower I’ve used. I was able to confirm its lower roar on the CES show floor. </p>
<p>Tone says the T1 also offers extended run time of up to 50 minutes on a charge in Eco mode. That too is greater than what I get on my mid-grade EGO. What’s more, the company plans to sell a battery backpack that will extend any clean-up sessions for several hours. The T1 also has a built-in LED “nightlight” so you can still use it after dark. And since it’s quieter than what you have now, you can do so without annoying your neighbors.</p>

<p>So, how does Whisper Aero achieve this? The company originally set out to devise a quieter solution for electric aerospace motors. Its engineers discovered that they could dramatically reduce noise and increase overall efficiency by redesigning the fan and motor. They&#39;re still pursuing that, but the company discovered its technology had other uses too.</p>
<p>The T1 is already available for preorder for $599 and it’s scheduled to ship in September. If you don’t care for the standard green color, you can spend another $100 for limited edition “Silence Is Golden” version. The battery backpack won’t arrive until Q1 2027 though (price TBD). Tone also says it has additional models in the works and it has a partnership with Stanley Black and Decker that will likely produce additional products with this tech on board. </p>

According to the tech company, the transition to the new provider should take about two years to complete, but customers can continue to use their Apple Cards as usual during the interim.&nbsp;Apple has already published an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://learn.applecard.apple/transition" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">FAQ</a> about the change, but the main takeaway is that the status quo is currently continuing and customers will receive information at a later date if any action is required. Mastercard will remain the Apple Card payment network under the new partnership.</p><p>Goldman Sachs was Apple&#39;s collaborator when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-apple-card.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">launched</a> the Apple Card in 2019.

Apple didn&#39;t disclose many details around either the current or future deals for its credit card, however the <em>WSJ</em> report claims the negotiations with JPMorgan Chase have been underway for more than a year. Sources told the publication that Goldman Sachs is offloading about $20 billion in outstanding customer balances at a discount of more than $1 billion. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/jpmorgan-chase-is-taking-over-the-apple-card-232711979.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re off-roading, it’s a neat idea to use your engine to top up your battery, which prompted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/3-big-announcements-from-bluetti-at-ces-2022-175050612.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Bluetti</a> to launch the Charger. You could hook it to your alternator and draw off energy as you drove to make sure you turned up to your campsite with full batteries. But if you’re also toting around solar panels on your roof, then it’s a shame you can’t also use that power to top up. This omission is what prompted Bluetti to turn up to CES 2026 with the Charger 2, which will take power from your engine and your solar panels at the same time.</p>
<p>Bluetti says the Charger 2’s dual-input architecture will accept 600W from the panels, 800W from the engine. All of that power will charge your batteries significantly faster than the first model, claiming it’s 13 times faster than a standard car charger. In addition, Charger 2 can manage more than one Bluetti power station and expansion batteries, should your power needs stretch. And the system is smart enough to know where the energy is coming from, managing the sources based on their availability. Plus, you can use it to jump start your engine should you need the help.</p>
<p>If you’re a Charger 1 owner and want to upgrade, it’s fairly painless to drop the old unit out in favor of its replacement. It uses the same cabling, so you can just hook the new model to your existing wires without having to get your fingers greasy. To reward that loyalty, the company will sell you an upgrade for $99, at least through February 7.</p>
<p>As for everyone else, you’ll be able to pick up the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-charger-2-alternator-solar-charger__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!Hup4QHaXiZAbBDrGvP6h21bZMpjKBCUfVIDR6_cFCutNYL_1H4cib59rfAOCtgC471jXE43c_TlNZ8eaMK3q$" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Charger 2</a> for $349 through February 7, at which point the price leaps to $499.</p>

We&#39;ve got some new CPUs, but the volatile RAM market will likely make everything expensive this year. Also, they dive into Dell&#39;s revival of the XPS brand, as well as iPolish&#39;s smart nails and Subtle&#39;s AI-powered VoiceBuds.</p><div><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:200px;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/VzZrFoPk" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen data-provider-name="iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><h2 id="jump-link-subscribe"><strong>Subscribe!</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b2a3988-c5c9-4640-8e2b-1de7b2717343&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=18e5fc2c-eb4a-471c-ad66-982d59bd2ee0&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=iTunes&amp;linkText=iTunes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2l0dW5lcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtZW5nYWRnZXQtcG9kY2FzdC9pZDExNDI3OTA1MzA_bXQ9MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMThlNWZjMmMtZWI0YS00NzFjLWFkNjYtOTgyZDU5YmQyZWUwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2l0dW5lcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtZW5nYWRnZXQtcG9kY2FzdC9pZDExNDI3OTA1MzA_bXQ9MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfN0eXyQpRDBg746vMkFJwRTpOl0Oc3as8SInBosdcXy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-engadget-podcast%2Fid1142790530%3Fmt%3D2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:iTunes;elmt:;slk:iTunes;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2">iTunes</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=18e5fc2c-eb4a-471c-ad66-982d59bd2ee0&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Spotify&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL29wZW4uc3BvdGlmeS5jb20vc2hvdy8zRUMzZE1JUkI5OWRrdm9TQmVTTzdHP3NpPWY3VUFMR0ttUkRXdE9yVThaNC11aVEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE4ZTVmYzJjLWViNGEtNDcxYy1hZDY2LTk4MmQ1OWJkMmVlMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuLnNwb3RpZnkuY29tL3Nob3cvM0VDM2RNSVJCOTlka3ZvU0JlU083Rz9zaT1mN1VBTEdLbVJEV3RPclU4WjQtdWlRIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZSqMBEpkb3QQ83eoFHGy64huEABXXN5QZ-17RT7XsEq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fshow%2F3EC3dMIRB99dkvoSBeSO7G%3Fsi%3Df7UALGKmRDWtOrU8Z4-uiQ" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;slk:Spotify;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://open.spotify.com/show/3EC3dMIRB99dkvoSBeSO7G?si=f7UALGKmRDWtOrU8Z4-uiQ">Spotify</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link" href="http://pca.st/mlY3" data-i13n="slk:Pocket Casts;cpos:3;pos:1">Pocket Casts</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link" href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/engadget/the-engadget-podcast" data-i13n="slk:Stitcher;cpos:4;pos:1">Stitcher</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link" href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6MjQ1MjIwOTU4L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M&amp;ep=14" data-i13n="slk:Google Podcasts;cpos:5;pos:1">Google Podcasts</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="jump-link-topics">Topics</h2><ul><li><p>The state of the PC industry in 2026 -- 02:22</p></li><li><p>Intel&#39;s new Core Ultra Series 3 chips -- &nbsp;12:41</p></li><li><p>Dell&#39;s XPS lineup is back -- 17:41</p></li><li><p>Our favorite products from &nbsp;CES: 26:36</p></li></ul><h2 id="jump-link-credits"><strong>Credits</strong></h2><p><strong>Hosts:</strong> Devindra Hardawar and Dan Cooper<br><strong>Producer:</strong> Devindra Hardawar<br><strong>Music:</strong> Dale North</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/engadget-podcast-ces-2026-and-the-rocky-year-ahead-for-the-pc-industry-221500019.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Display is the part of its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gear/samsung/">giant parent company</a> that makes OLEDs, LCDs and other screens for both Samsung devices and anyone else that can afford them. This year, it’s going all-in on OLEDs of the future. And that meant things like foldable displays with invisible creases, robots hurling basketballs at supertough OLED panels, and OLED screens packed into baffling form factors for no good reason.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-creases">Creases</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/02758cb0-ec12-11f0-b35d-5627e1ac245d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/02758cb0-ec12-11f0-b35d-5627e1ac245d" style="height:1335px;width:2373px;" alt="Samsung Display at CES 2026" data-uuid="7b7324ad-3419-34cd-ac92-550a8a6d6ab5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung Display</div></figure>
<p>The “seamless” foldable display that might be a part of a future foldable iPhone disappeared from the booth during our tour, reappearing when it was time to leave. (This is an image provided by Samsung Display.) The device was labelled as an R&amp;D concept, but it somehow disguised the crease in the center of the main display, making the (unlabelled) Galaxy Z Fold on the left look like a messy first-iteration foldable. There&#39;s still a crease there Will it actually form part of Apple’s foray into foldables, or just part of the Z Fold 8?</p>

<p>This isn’t a record player you’ll ever buy. You don’t need an OLED display on the side of your wireless headphones, but you <em>could</em> have them. I liked the cute OLED pendants; a customizable near-future button badge, but a lot of this is just devices for the sake of making them.</p>
<p>The booth tour had a small segment dedicated to portable gaming OLED, adding more possibilities whether that’s an eye-sight for FPS games or extra HUD for the most important info.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-worlds-brightest-oled-tv">The world’s brightest OLED TV</h2>

<p>Reaching 4,500-nit brightness, I had to squint when sat in front of this beastly OLED. For reference, consumer-level TVs typically peak at around 2,700 nits. Compared to other display technologies, OLED can achieve deeper contrast and more accurate color reproduction, but it often lacks the brightness of rival TV technologies. Not for this prototype. Let me get my sunglasses.</p>

<p>I didn’t consider OLED displays to be more fragile than other display technology, but that didn’t stop Samsung Display from installing a robot arm that throws a basketball at a hoop with a backboard made of 18 foldable OLEDs. With a bang, making Samsung Display execs and engineers nearby increasingly anxious as the days of CES go on.</p>

<p>After Samsung  finally solved the problem of weight and thickness with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it made life hard for itself again with the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html">TriFold</a>, with 50 percent more foldable screen. But it&#39;s worth seeing how Samsung’s foldables have evolved over the past few years. A solid reminder that the first Galaxy Fold (2019) was beefy.</p>

<p>Samsung Display has begun mass production of its 360Hz QD-OLED panel, with new “V-Stripe” RGB pixel structures. Inside each pixel, subpixels are vertically aligned, which appears to improve the clarity of text edges and other small contrast objects. While it was framed at the booth as a boon for office workers, a corner was dedicated to gaming applications.</p>

<p>Digital cockpits are the lifeblood of a CES showfloor, and Samsung Display’s version is predictably loaded with yet more OLEDs. The centerpiece is a “Flexible L” display that flows into the dashboard. A dedicated 13.8-inch display on the passenger side also slides out of the dash.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-display-ces-2026-playful-demos-and-mysterious-prototypes-220407696.html?src=rss]]></description>

It uses the Meta Ray-Ban glasses&#39;s computer vision abilities to stream video of your conversation to the accompanying app, which uses an algorithm to detect facial expressions and gestures.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/alleye_haptics.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/alleye_haptics.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The bumps on the underside of the Aleye vibrate to form unique patterns." data-uuid="630b1b6f-9919-4771-88aa-7e736d07bca4"/><figcaption>The bumps on the underside of the Aleye vibrate to form unique patterns.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Users can customize which expressions and gestures they want to detect in the app, which also provides a way for people to learn to distinguish between the different patterns. Hapware CEO Jack Walters said in their early testing people have been able to learn a handful of patterns within a few minutes. The company has also tried to make them intuitive. &quot;Jaw drop might feel like a jaw drop, a wave feels more like a side to side haptics,&quot; he explains.</p><p>The app is also able to use Meta AI to give vocal cues about people&#39;s expressions, though Hapware&#39;s CTO Dr. Bryan Duarte told me it can get a bit distracting to talk to people while the assistant is babbling in your ear. Duarte, who has been blind since a motorcycle accident at&nbsp;the age of 18, told me he prefers Aleye to Meta AI&#39;s other accessibility features like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-rolling-out-live-ai-and-shazam-integration-to-its-smart-glasses-192602898.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Live AI</a>. &quot;It will only tell me there&#39;s a person in front of me,&quot; he explains. &quot;It won&#39;t tell me if you&#39;re smiling. You have to prompt it every time, it won&#39;t just tell you stuff.&quot;</p><p>Hapware has started taking <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hapware.com/preorder/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">pre-orders</a> for the Aleye, which starts at $359 for the wristband or $637 for the wristband plus a year subscription to the app (a subscription is required and otherwise will cost $29 a month). A pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses is also not included, though Meta has also been building a number of its own accessibility features for the device.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/this-haptic-wristband-pairs-with-meta-smart-glasses-to-decode-facial-expressions-214305431.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is launching a new facet for its AI chatbot called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">ChatGPT Health</a>. This new feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps to ChatGPT in order to get more tailored responses to queries about their health. The company noted that there will be additional privacy safeguards for this separate space within ChatGPT, and said that it will not use conversations held in Health for training foundational models. ChatGPT Health is currently in a testing stage, and there are some regional restrictions on which health apps can be connected to the AI company&#39;s platform.</p><p>The announcement from OpenAI acknowledges that this new development &quot;is not intended for diagnosis or treatment,&quot; but it&#39;s worth repeating. No part of ChatGPT, or any other artificial intelligence chatbot, is qualified to provide any kind of medial advice. Not only are these platforms capable of making dangerously incorrect statements, but feeding such personal and private information into a chatbot is generally not a recommended practice. It seems especially unwise to share with a company that only bothered paying <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-forms-advisory-council-on-wellbeing-and-ai-183815365.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">even cursory lip service</a> to the psychological impacts of its product after at least one teenager used the chatbot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to plan suicide</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-is-launching-a-new-dedicated-health-portal-210150083.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's a new year, and a great time to fulfill your resolution to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html">practice better cybersecurity</a>. The early days of January are a great time to grab a last-minute subscription for yourself or a loved one. With access to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a>, you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart  online trackers.</p>
<p>Although we strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Plenty of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running end-of-year deals that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price.</p>

CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>
