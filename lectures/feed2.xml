New subscribers can get three free months of that plan — which, at $17 per month normally, comes out to $51 in savings for the whole period.</p> 
<p>The Family Plan allows six different users to access the platform. It offers cross-device support and each user is tied to an Apple ID, so their favorite music won't mess with anyone else's algorithm.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Apple Music actually topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html">best music streaming platforms</a>, and for good reason. It sounds great and it's easy to use. What else is there? All music is available in CD quality or higher and there are plenty of personalized playlists and the like. The platform also operates a number of live radio stations, which is fun.</p> 
<p>The service is available for Android devices, but it really shines on Apple products. To that end, the web and Windows PC apps aren’t as polished as the iOS version. It doesn't <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2025/01/streaming-payouts-hit-new-low-artists-earn/">pay artists properly</a>, but that's true of every music streaming platform. Apple Music does pay out more than Spotify, but that's an incredibly low bar.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hydrow is adding a third model to its lineup of snazzy modern-day rowing machines, and this time it’s bringing along a dollop of AI. The Hydrow Arc sits on the same footprint as its former Pro machine, but gets a bigger, 24-inch touchscreen display. It’s also equipped with what the company is calling “premium sound” and better workout recommendations.</p> 
<p>But what the company really wants to talk about is its new HydroMetrics Index, using AI to look at your workout and give you a single score at the end. That score will monitor your precision, power and endurance, letting you track your progress over time. When paired with AI, the system will also be able to offer up personalized workout recommendations that target your weak areas.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The arrival of the Arc means a broader shakeup of the company’s range, with the Hydro Pro no longer sitting atop the company’s tree. It’s being renamed as the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-28-hydrow-rowing-machine-erg-first-look.html">Hydrow Origin</a>, and will get a price cut to $2,195, while the entry-level <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hydrow-wave-smaller-cheaper-smart-rowing-machine-140012022.html">Hydrow Wave</a> will set you back $1,995. The Arc, meanwhile, takes the flagship slot, and will cost $2,295, with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hydrow;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=25723c62-4c43-4d2a-821a-ee5f9f065607&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bed60481-50f1-4283-9e32-2881c884c733&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hydrow&amp;linkText=orders+starting+today&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2h5ZHJvdy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZWQ2MDQ4MS01MGYxLTQyODMtOWUzMi0yODgxYzg4NGM3MzMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm93LmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdoNd8lZBTuNUQKIs4sp01vSMXaf956Kl_uQcRdSdBKa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhydrow.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://hydrow.com/">orders starting today</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and a handful of other music labels <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-and-other-music-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-old-records-110108988.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against the Internet Archive over the Great 78 Project, which sought to preserve and digitize 78 rpm shellac records. Now, both parties have announced in a filing that they have <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/internet-archive-labels-settle-great-78-copyright-lawsuit-1235427887/">reached a settlement</a> and that they&#39;re filing to dismiss the lawsuit within 45 days. The plaintiffs said in the filing that they were &quot;writ[ing] to advise this court that they have settled this matter.&quot; They didn&#39;t reveal the details of their agreement, and it&#39;s very likely that they won&#39;t be made public. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/15/an-update-on-the-great-78s-lawsuit/">blog post</a> by the Internet Archive, it said they &quot;have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/internet-archives-big-battle-with-music-publishers-ends-in-settlement/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, the Internet Archive, its founder Brewster Kale and the project&#39;s recording engineer George Blood were the last ones to agree on the settlement. The labels&#39; original lawsuit focused on 2,749 recordings by artists like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong. Some of the iconic tracks made available by the Great 78 Project included classics, such as <em>White Christmas, Sing, Sing, Sing</em> and <em>The Christmas Song</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The labels argued in their lawsuit that the tracks &quot;face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed&quot; since they&#39;re already available through various music services. They then amended their lawsuit and added more recordings to the complaint, bringing the total to 4,142. If they didn&#39;t settle and the court had sided with the labels, the Internet Archive could have been ordered to pay up to $150,000 per recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Internet Archive previously <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-archive-violated-publisher-copyrights-by-lending-ebooks-court-rules-164629790.html">lost a lawsuit</a> filed by four US publishers led by the Hachette Book Group over its National Emergency Library project, which it launched during the pandemic. Under the project, it made 1.4 million ebooks, including copyrighted works, available to the public after the lockdowns closed the doors of libraries worldwide. It tried to appeal its loss, but the court <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-internet-archive-loses-its-appeal-of-ebook-copyright-case-ruling-202452279.html">sided with the publishers</a> again and determined that its emergency library couldn&#39;t operate under the fair use doctrine.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/sony-and-other-music-labels-settle-copyright-lawsuit-against-the-internet-archive-130023986.html?src=rss]]></description>

The 16 percent discount a new low for the power bank and available in the black and white models. It's just about a third of an inch thick and attaches right to your iPhone. On that note, it works with any MagSafe compatible phone with a magnetic case.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Anker's Nano 5K MagGo Slim is our pick for best, well, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">slim MagSafe power bank</a>. It took two and a half hours to charge an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to 90 percent. However, it could boost the battery to 40 percent in just under an hour. Overall, though, the minimalist design and easy to grip matte texture, really sold it to us.</p>

<p>Congratulations to those who can easily afford the $799 Apple Watch Ultra 3. But for most of us in the market for a new Apple-friendly smartwatch, the choice is more between the entry-level <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-se-3-has-an-s10-chip-and-always-on-display-173033538.html">Apple Watch SE 3</a> and the mainstay <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-hands-on-feels-and-looks-the-same-but-real-changes-are-deeper-200438367.html">Apple Watch Series 11</a>, which start at $249 and $399, respectively. That used to be more of a no-brainer default to the current Series model, since the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-2022-review-battery-life-workout-health-tracking-144551799-144551820.html">second-gen SE</a> had gone three full years without an update, in the meantime getting lapped by the Series 9 and 10. Despite the price gap, the latest models share more similarities than differences.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We're still evaluating the SE 3 and will have a full review soon. But just looking at the spec sheets, it's clear that the latest model <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-acquiesced-to-my-apple-watch-se-3-demands-mostly-220726287.html">fixes quite a few of the SE 2's flaws</a>. However, the Series 11 is still ahead when it comes to design, health tracking, battery life and premium materials, to name a few.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>That said, choosing between the two this year is more about priorities. For instance, do you just want casual step counting and sleep tracking or are you interested in using the deeper health insights? Or are you buying for child or elderly relative, and is just having cellular capability or fall detection a bigger deal?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since you can't pick one of these up at the Apple Store this minute — they'll be on display and available for sale on Friday, September 19 — there's still plenty of time. We'll walk you through the similarities and differences of these two Apple Watches. Meanwhile, if you want to know how the Series watch has changed year over year, check out the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-vs-apple-watch-series-10-should-you-upgrade-185552623.html">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Apple Watch Series 10</a>.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-apple-watch-se-3-vs-series-11-whats-basically-the-same">Apple Watch SE 3 vs. Series 11: What's basically the same</h2> 
<p>Both of these smartwatches will come equipped with watchOS 26 out of the box, but that's not the only thing they have in common.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Always-On Retina display: </strong>This is a first for SE models, and means that the display no longer fades to black after a few seconds.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Basic heart and health features: </strong>Notifications on high and low heart rate, irregular rhythms and low cardio fitness; sleep tracking with sleep apnea notifications and sleep score support; temperature sensing via your wrist; Cycle Tracking with retrospective ovulation estimates and optical heart rate sensors; and noise monitoring are fully supported on both devices.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The S10 chip: </strong>Both watches are powered by the same S10 chip, so there shouldn't be any major performance differences.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>5G support (on cellular models): </strong>While it costs $50 to $100 more — and requires monthly service — the SE 3 offers the same 5G cellular option as the Series 11, allowing wearers to text and call even when they're outside an area with Wi-Fi coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Gesture support: </strong>Both watches offer the new wrist flick and double tap gestures, which can be used for easier one-handed watch control.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Emergency SOS: </strong>Apple is continuing (until further notice) to offer this service for free to Apple Watch users.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Water resistance to 50m: </strong>Both watches are safe for swimming and bathing.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Fall Detection and Crash Detection: </strong>Apple touts both of these features as lifesavers, and they're both fully equipped on both models.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Find iPhone: </strong>Misplaced your iPhone? Press a button on either watch, and your phone will send a loud notification so you can locate it.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Fast-charge capable: </strong>Both watches can get up to an 80% charge in under an hour (with compatible fast chargers, of course). The SE 2 wasn't fast-charge capable, regardless of what charger you used.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ion-X glass face: </strong>The baseline version of both watches utilizes a version of this tough face, which is more scratch- and crack-resistant than the ones found in their earlier respective models.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>In addition to those, both watches share some other common feature sets, including storage (64GB), sensors (altimeter, compass, gyroscope) and wireless options (Wi-Fi 4, Bluetooth 5.3 and nearly identical GPS offerings).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-se-3-vs-series-11-heres-the-stuff-you-wont-get-if-you-stick-with-the-se-line">SE 3 vs. Series 11: What the more affordable watch lacks</h2> 
<p>If you decide to stick with the SE 3 instead of the Series 11, here's what you'll miss out on:&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Advanced health features: </strong>Hypertension notifications (<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-clearance-for-hypertension-alerts-120046138.html">cleared by the FDA</a>), a new feature that detects signs of high blood pressure, are not available on the SE 3. You also won't have access to the ECG app or blood oxygen monitoring. Electrical heart sensors are also not on the SE 3.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Brighter and larger display: </strong>The Series 11 offers a screen that's twice as bright as the SE 3. Additionally, both Series 11 sizes are larger: You can choose between the 46mm (compared to the SE's 44mm), or the smaller 42mm size (40mm for SE).</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Thinner case design: </strong>The Series 11 is nearly 10 percent thinner than the SE 3.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Longer battery life: </strong>The Series 11 has a battery life of up to 24 hours (38 hours in low power mode), while the SE 3 gets up to 18 hours (32 hours in low power mode). That means you could be left charging your watch when you need it the most.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Titanium options:</strong> A premium material, titanium, is available for the Series 11 watch. If you go that route, it has a sapphire crystal display, too.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>More color options:</strong> The Series 11 has seven color options, whereas the SE 3 model has only two. The aluminum frame comes in jet black, rose gold, silver and space gray, while the titanium frame comes in slate, gold and natural. The SE 3 comes in midnight and starlight (aluminum only).</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>There are a handful of other niche features where the Series 11 edges out the SE 3 (depth gauge, water temperature sensor, dust resistance), but the ones listed above are the big ones.</p>

<p>Now that you know what's similar and what's different, you should consider which features you'll actually use, how much you're willing to pay and how long you plan to keep the smartwatch. If you're looking for cutting-edge health tracking — like hypertension notifications and the ECG app — longer battery life and a more fashion-forward smartwatch, the Series 11 is definitely your starting point. It starts at $399, or $499 for cellular models. (Going the titanium route sends the price upwards to $699 or more.)</p> 
<p> <core-commerce id="a8f8187a6fd942fd80e20b833b53fdd8" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smartwatch-Aluminium-Always/dp/B0FQFL8PZ5?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>But as we've noted above, the SE 3 has really narrowed the feature gap compared to its predecessor. If you can live without those more advanced health features and you're okay with your watchband doing the heavy lifting for your wrist styling, the SE 3 may well be all you need. And because the addition of cellular capability is just a $50 add-on for that model, it's a much more affordable choice for kids and seniors (where always-on connectivity is often more important).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Apple Watch SE 3 starts at $249, and jumps to just $299 for cellular capability. That's a hefty savings for a watch that retains nearly all the key safety offerings — and many of the health features — of the Series 11, so take a closer look at it before you scoop up the pricier model. It may be all you need.&nbsp;</p>

Now, attention is shifting to the app&#39;s Chinese algorithm, with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/550e4680-89e7-4b59-bb5d-2064cd6799c7"><em>Financial Times </em>reporting</a> it will be used in the US version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Jingtao, deputy director of the China&#39;s national internet regulator, told reporters that the deal included &quot;licensing the algorithm and other intellectual property rights.&quot; The <em>Financial Times</em> further reports that US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said a US version of TikTok would have some &quot;Chinese characteristics&quot; but that American investors would control it.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That&#39;s a significant turnaround as TikTok&#39;s algorithm has been at the heart of many conversations and analysis about the app&#39;s presence in the US. Lawmakers have sought to analyze how it operates and pushed for TikTok to be banned or sold in large part to move away from Chinese technology. President Trump holds the power to approve any potential deals.&nbsp;</p>

Not much appears to have changed with Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">smartwatch</a>, with no redesign to be seen. Still, that isn’t to say the Apple Watch Series 11 is unimpressive or unexciting. It has new health-related features, improved durability, 5G connectivity, support for a wrist-flick gesture and, for the first time in years, the promise of longer battery life.</p> 
<p>The most noteworthy of these is Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-includes-5g-and-a-hypertension-tracking-feature-172451506.html">new hypertension alerts system</a>, which only <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-approval-for-hypertension-alerts-120046036.html">received FDA clearance last week</a> soon after <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event/">the “Awe dropping” launch event</a>. The feature has yet to roll out to review units, and will remain untested until later this week, when I can enable it. Thankfully, it’s not a tool that will impact my experience with the Series 11 in my daily life, as it’s something that should work mostly in the background and only alert me if it notices I might have high blood pressure.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Because of that, I’m not going to be able to evaluate its practicality in this review, and I will update this piece when I’ve had a chance to use it. To be clear, though, even after it arrives, you won’t be able to use this feature ad-hoc to get blood pressure readings. Right now, all I can say is I think it’s an important area of health to pay attention to and I’m glad Apple is giving it due attention.</p> 
<p>Of all the newness coming to the Series 11, the one that more people might encounter more frequently are the sleep score, wrist flick gesture and longer battery life.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-a-very-apple-approach-to-the-sleep-score">A very Apple approach to the Sleep Score</h2> 
<p>In the land of sleep-tracking wearables, sleep scores are <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-14-basis-peak-review.html">far</a> from a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-fitbit-versa-2-review-alexa-amoled.html">new feature</a>. But Apple is introducing it with the Watch Series 11, and as usual, its approach is a bit different from the competition. Whereas the likes of Fitbit, Google and Samsung will present you with a number and some data on how you slept, maybe assigning an animal to represent your profile, Apple’s score is shown in a ring with three colors. They represent the three components your Sleep Score is being calculated from: duration, interruptions and bedtime.</p> 
<p>The first two are pretty self-explanatory; the longer you sleep and the less you wake up during the night, the better your score. As for the last one, Apple is looking for consistency in the hours at which you go to bed. The idea is that the routine helps your body maintain some consistency and better prepare for recovery.</p> 
<p>I’m a huge proponent of getting more sleep, but I never was a stickler for bedtime schedules. As a reformed night owl that used to go to bed at 2AM and wake up closer to 9AM, I now go to bed by midnight and rise at 6AM. I’m surprised that despite having to get up earlier nowadays, I can still feel refreshed and energetic, as long as I’ve been routinely getting enough rest at roughly the same time each night.</p> 
<p>While I haven’t worn the Series 11 to bed for that many nights, the Sleep Scores I’ve received so far have been telling. The first was 82, after a long day checking out of a hotel, meeting up with a friend from Singapore and then moving to a different friend’s home in California. I only got around to unpacking after dinner and a long heart-to-heart chat that lasted hours, so by the time I collapsed in bed it was about 1:30AM.</p> 
<p>The next night, since I was already unpacked, I was able to fall asleep a bit earlier, just past midnight. The result? A Sleep Score of 97, with full marks across the bedtime and duration sections and only one interruption of three minutes. When I finally got home and forced myself to wear the watch to bed, a combination of jetlag and general anxiety brought my score down to 53, with the duration of 2 hours and 17 minutes being the main contributing factor.</p>

<p>Not only did the numbers seem to match how rested I felt, it also felt like Apple accurately detected when I had drifted off into slumber. I did find it funny how the Series 11 almost immediately told me to try and move about to meet my Stand goal for the hour, and even though I hardly stirred, it quickly told me I had moved enough to hit the mark.</p> 
<p>Compared to the offerings from Google and Samsung, the broad strokes of Apple’s sleep score are similar. In my experience, I’d get about the same numbers for those types of nights. But it’s not the Score alone that matters. I like that Apple’s system makes it very easy to see at a glance what areas I should strive to improve. It’s almost like closing your activity rings in Fitness or watchOS — because it’s so clear on the Sleep Score’s ring where your deficits might be, it makes trying to hit a target a little easier to visualize.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, sleep scores on the Fitbit app, which is what Pixel Watches use, will <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236407?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-to-find-sleeping-heart-rate-details">show more data as you keep tapping on the charts</a>.</p> 
<p>I do prefer Google (or Fitbit) when it comes to the interface and data visualization, though. On Apple’s Health app, scrolling through your previous results isn’t as simple as swiping horizontally through pages. I also wish I could tap the “interruptions” scale to see exactly what times I stirred or woke up. I eventually did find that information, but I had to go to the Sleep graph in its dedicated section to see more. It’s just a bit unintuitive and requires a lot of tapping and swiping around to find things.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-the-series-11s-hardier-design-is-a-subtle-refinement">The Series 11’s hardier design is a subtle refinement</h2> 
<p>I usually loathe going to bed with a smartwatch on, but because the Series 11 is so thin and light, it wasn’t too bad. Its dimensions are identical to the Series 10, measuring 9.7mm thin and weighing about 0.3 grams more. As my relatively high Sleep Scores show, I didn’t actually jolt awake in the middle of the night like I usually did with previous heavier, clunkier watches. (I still hate wearing watches to sleep, though.)</p> 
<p>More importantly, the Series 11 also has an IonX glass coating that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as the Series 10, which might account for the slight increase in weight. While I didn’t try very hard to test that claim, I’ve certainly bumped my review unit against lots of hard surfaces, including the iPhone 17 Pro, and have yet to see a scratch.</p> 
<p>I even knocked it against the Series 10 on my other wrist as I laid my hands on top of each other in various yoga poses that involved lying face down, and neither device was damaged. Given that the Series 10 I’ve been wearing remains pretty pristine after a year, I’m confident that the Series 11’s hardier material means it’ll stay similarly unmarred.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-workout-tracking-gestures-and-watchos-26">Workout-tracking, gestures and watchOS 26</h2> 
<p>During my time with the Series 11, I tracked a variety of workouts, including a yoga class, as well as my usual sessions of outdoor walking, functional strength and cross training. I noticed little differences here compared to my Series 10, and the main changes were the watchOS 26 interface. After I turned on Workout Buddy, selected one of three available voices and let it finish downloading, I had to set some targets and connect headphones before I even heard anything during my sessions. I don’t usually work out with headphones on, but I can see the coaching being useful for an aspirational future where I’m perhaps trying to hit a 6-minute mile (my current time is about 8 minutes).</p>

<p>I will note that a lot of what makes the Series 11 feel new is in the software, which will be rolling out to older Apple Watches soon. <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">watchOS 26</a> brings the Liquid Glass style, which allowed me to use some slick-looking fonts on my clock. I also liked the larger buttons across the interface and the refreshing feeling of looking at the translucent cards instead of the version before. It’s just a visual change that makes things feel updated, and my eyes welcomed it.</p> 
<p>The Series 11 also gets a new wrist flick gesture that feels familiar for those of us who have covered the smartwatch industry since its inception. The gist is that you can quickly twist your wrist away from you to interact with your wearable. On other devices, you could use this action to scroll through lists of apps, for instance. On the Apple Watch Series 11, you have to first raise your wrist when a notification arrives, then flick your wrist to dismiss it and return to your watch face. This also works to end calls, alarms and timers. I was able to use this to silence an alarm, as long as I first raised my wrist before flicking.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-that-lasts-longer-than-a-day">Battery that lasts longer than a day</h2> 
<p>When Apple said during its keynote that the Series 11 will last 24 hours thanks to its re-engineered battery, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html">my colleague Sam Rutherford scoffed</a>. That number is measly compared to the multi-day runtimes promised by the likes of Pixel and Samsung watches, let alone Garmin’s almost week-long estimates. But <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=36cf1f2c-017d-428a-afaa-69f826446fc3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=when+you+consider+Apple+promises+up+to+18+hours+for+the+Series+10&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vd2F0Y2gvY29tcGFyZS8_bW9kZWxMaXN0PXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy0xMSx3YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtMTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2Y2YxZjJjLTAxN2QtNDI4YS1hZmFhLTY5ZjgyNjQ0NmZjMyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3dhdGNoL2NvbXBhcmUvP21vZGVsTGlzdD13YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtMTEsd2F0Y2gtc2VyaWVzLTEwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcVcfO99KLwUnNLAw7y02Nlh9x0rpq-WpdRnaBMygrff&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2Fcompare%2F%3FmodelList%3Dwatch-series-11%2Cwatch-series-10" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/?modelList=watch-series-11,watch-series-10">when you consider Apple promises up to 18 hours for the Series 10</a>, the improvement is nothing to sneeze at.</p> 
<p>Also, 24 hours is an estimate depending on how you use your Apple Watch. Many people only put their watch on when heading out for a walk, run or workout, while others use it all day. That estimate includes time for overnight sleep tracking, with 18 hours devoted to daytime “activities like checking the time, receiving notifications, using apps and doing a 60-minute workout.”</p> 
<p>The gain in runtime is thanks in part to a 9 percent bigger battery in the 42mm model and an 11 percent larger one in the 46mm version, as well as optimizations in software and a new modem that also supports 5G.</p> 
<p>The Series 11 certainly outlasted the 24-hour estimate in my experience. It usually lasts one and a half days, including some light activity tracking, media control and sleep tracking. One day, I pulled it off the charger at 2PM, tracked a workout at 4PM, used the camera remote control and viewfinder for about 20 minutes, went to dinner and wore it to bed. I woke up at 8AM with 39 percent left in the tank. Even hours later at 3:15PM, I still had a healthy 22 percent to work with. On a different day, I woke up with 29 percent of juice, tracked a 37-minute morning walk and had about 20 percent remaining. The energy efficiency does seem to have improved.</p> 
<p>This also means continuous runtimes for specific activities have been increased. For example, you can run for an extra hour while tracking your heart rate, GPS and using other Apple Watch features for eight hours straight. Or, more likely, simply run a marathon without worrying about having juice after.</p>

<p>Apple was also able to boost its low power mode, now squeezing up to 38 hours of juice when enabled. It will turn off the always on display, disconnect cellular and Wi-Fi connections and also limit sensor activity, so background heart rate measurements and related alerts won’t work. I switched it on at 9:20PM one night when the battery was at 86 percent, in anticipation of a long day away from a charger.</p> 
<p>The next day, after tracking about three hours of sleep overnight, a few workouts and general testing, the watch still held fairly strong at 22 percent at 8:50PM. I did have to restart the device and turn off low power mode a few times throughout the day just to check that certain features (like the AOD and gestures) were working, though, so uninterrupted use of the mode might get more hours out of it.</p> 
<p>Charging is also quite speedy. I placed the Series 11 on the charging puck at about 1PM with 8 percent left, and came back ten minutes later to see it had already reached 38 percent. Just over thirty minutes later, it was fully recharged. That, of course, is with an Apple-supplied fast charger.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-which-apple-watch-is-right-for-you">Which Apple Watch is right for you?</h2> 
<p>If you’re reading this review, you’re not likely to be considering non-Apple watches, so I won’t even compare the Series 11 to the Galaxy Watch 8 or the Pixel Watch 4. We haven’t even reviewed that latter one, anyway. You also probably don’t currently own <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html">a Series 10</a>, though if you do and are wondering if this is worth an upgrade, read on.</p> 
<p>For those on older Apple Watches (like the Series 9 or earlier), the Series 11 is a solid upgrade. The battery life improvements will be meaningful even if you’re coming from the Series 10, though if you’re moving on from anything older the impact will be greater. You’ll appreciate the bigger screen with wider viewing angles, thinner profile and general modern features like the watchOS refresh and AI-based tools.</p> 
<p>If you’re considering one of the three new Apple Watches, this year is a trickier situation than usual. Because it added an always on display and faster charging to the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-acquiesced-to-my-apple-watch-se-3-demands-mostly-220726287.html">SE 3</a>, Apple has made the entry-level smartwatch a no-brainer for pretty much anyone considering a starter device. For $250, that watch gives you everything the Series 11 does, except in a slightly bulkier case and smaller, dimmer display. You’ll be giving up ECG and blood oxygen features, as well as hypertension alerts and sensors for depth and water temperature. Battery life is also a bit shorter, and you won’t have an ultra-wideband chip for precision Find My.</p> 
<p>But with the Watch SE 3, you’ll still be able to access a wide range of health and fitness features like wrist temperature monitoring, sleep score, emergency SOS, fall and crash detection and more. It’s a compelling option at an appealing price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>I don’t expect companies to completely retool their products, especially 11 generations in. The Apple Watch Series 11 is a refinement of an already winning formula, packing a device that’s always on your person with exactly the type of passive features you’d want in something like that. Whether it’s quietly keeping tabs on your heart health and blood pressure changes, or providing better information on how well you slept, or even saving your life if you’ve fallen or gotten lost in the wilderness, the Series 11 is a capable companion. With longer battery life this time, it promises to provide even more peace of mind. Nifty touches like Liquid Glass in watchOS 26, Workout Buddy and 5G connectivity are icing on a rich, substantial cake.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html?src=rss]]></description>

Other upgrades include the S10 chip, a slightly larger display, bigger battery that lasts up to 42 hours, support for 5G, as well as the hypertension and sleep score features coming to the Series 11 (and also the Ultra 2 and several older Apple Watch models).</p>
<p>While I continue to review the Series 11 before spending more time with the Ultra 3 (and the SE 3), I wanted to share what it’s like to use satellite communications on the wearable and how it differs from the approach on the Pixel Watch 4. To be clear, I have yet to receive a review unit of the Pixel Watch 4, so my impressions are based on a recorded demo at a hands-on event. For the Watch Ultra 3, I have a review unit and am using its built-in demo tool to connect to satellites.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can launch satellite communications on the Watch Ultra 3 in a few ways. Add it to the Control Center or as a complication on any watch face, and you’ll get options to send messages, share your location or contact emergency services. The first two require paid cellular service for your smartwatch. The device will also automatically suggest satellite connectivity when you’re offline, though that’s a situation I have yet to encounter. Regardless of where you use it, a lot of the process of connecting to a satellite is similar to that on the iPhone 14 and newer. If you’ve never tried that before, hang tight, as I will explain the steps a little further down.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-emergency-satellite-communications-on-the-apple-watch-ultra-3">Emergency satellite communications on the Apple Watch Ultra 3</h2>
<p>There’s also another screen where you might encounter a prompt to link to a satellite — in the phone dialer. Whether you’re on the watch or iPhone, Apple imagines (and likely hopes) that dialing your local emergency hotline is your first step. Here in the US, that number is 911. Of course, as a socially responsible person, I didn’t want to unnecessarily burden emergency services and did not try this out myself on the Watch Ultra 3. Instead, Apple representatives gave us a demo in Cupertino last week, and made a call to 911 that was routed to the company’s own call centers.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the process for emergency SOS via satellite is different from using Messages or Find My via satellite because users are likely to be dialing their local services first and foremost. Only when that fails will the emergency satellite communications interface kick in. Once you select the Emergency SOS via Satellite option that appears after a few seconds or when your watch detects you’re offline, you’ll be shown a list of guidelines, recommending you be outside with a clear view of the sky and explaining that transmission will take longer than when sent over cellular networks.</p>
<p>After that, you’ll be presented a series of multiple choice questions to inform rescue services of your condition and environment. Thanks to the Watch Ultra 3’s larger screen, the system’s large buttons and readable font weren’t hard to see, and I could make out the options at arm’s length. A few taps later, we had selected some answers indicating we were “lost or trapped,” alone, unharmed and near steep terrain. The Apple representative performing our demo also opted to notify the emergency contacts set up on the Watch Ultra 3.</p>

<p>Once that was done, the watch displayed an interface similar to the version on the iPhone, featuring a glowing arc and translucent image of the earth. Words on the screen said “Try to get a clear view of the sky” and guided the wearer in various directions to attempt to connect to satellites passing overhead. After a link was established, the words “Sending report” appeared with a progress bar below.</p>
<p>We had to wait a minute and a half for the message to go through, which is quite long, but it was probably not the usual amount of time. At about 25 seconds in, it seemed like the connection was lost and had to be re-established. That may seem like a long while to hold your wrist up, but Apple did say you only need to lift your arm while establishing a connection to the satellite and not while the information was being sent. I believe the rep only had their arm up so we could more easily see the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, when the report had been delivered, the Watch Ultra 3 took us to the Message window showing a confirmation that the request had been received. It also tells the wearer to reply with “Stop” if emergency services were not or no longer required.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-using-satellites-to-send-messages-and-your-location">Using satellites to send Messages and your location</h2>
<p>Outside of using satellite communications when you’re in need of emergency services, you can also send messages or share your location when you’re off the grid. This, again, mirrors the iPhone version of this service. You can go to the Find My app on the Watch Ultra 3 to share your location when you’re out of coverage, and your position can be shared up to once every 15 minutes to previously added contacts. In the Messages app on the watch, you can contact people you’ve chatted with in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>In my experience, it was easiest to add Satellite as a complication to a watch face. Tapping the button will bring up the Satellite screen with options to try a demo, go to Messages, share your location or contact emergency services. Like on the iPhone, the demo is there for users to get familiar with the process of connecting to a satellite, so they’re not completely unfamiliar in high pressure situations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I spent most of my time with the Ultra 3 so far in areas that had good coverage and signal, I never really got a chance to try to send a message or my location via satellite. First world problems, I know. I’ll embark on an adventure upstate soon to check it out, though, and will report back after.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with Messages or Find My via Satellite on iPhones may wonder why those features exist. It’s not just for the frivolous desire to play with a novel feature. You can send texts, emojis and tapback reactions to let a loved one know you arrived in the desert safely for Burning Man, for example. Texts go through with a delivery message that says “sent via Satellite,” so your recipient will understand you have limited connectivity and can’t engage in a full-blown tea-spilling session right then.</p>
<p>Or, if you’re like my partner and sometimes go camping in the middle of nowhere, sharing your location when you’ve arrived at your campsite can bring some peace of mind. (Note: I don’t go camping.) My partner tends to favor forested areas, though, where satellite connectivity would struggle with the dense foliage, hampering its usefulness.</p>
<p>To be very clear, emergency SOS via Satellite will be supported on all models of the Watch Ultra 3, but satellite communications for Messages and Find My require a paid cellular plan. With all purchases of the Ultra 3, Apple is providing two years of satellite service for emergency, Messages and Find My.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-apple-watch-ultra-3-vs-pixel-watch-4-the-satellite-comparison">Apple Watch Ultra 3 vs Pixel Watch 4: The satellite comparison</h2>
<p>That’s somewhat similar to Google’s approach for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-hands-on-a-long-thoughtful-list-of-improvements-160015292.html">the Pixel Watch 4</a>, where Satellite SOS “is included at no additional charge for 2 years after launch.” However, only the LTE models of the Pixel Watch support its satellite feature, and it’s only available in the contiguous United States at the moment. Google’s version also uses Skylo’s Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN), and adopts similar haptic and audio cues to the Watch Ultra 3’s in the connecting process. One area that appears to be different is that the Pixel Watch 4 will offer a &quot;check replies&quot; button that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-watch-satellite-sos/">Google says</a> “guides you to re-establish connection for updates from emergency services as needed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s Find My and emergency satellite features will work in 18 countries at launch, including the US, UK, Japan, Switzerland, Australia and others. Messages via satellite is limited to Mexico, Canada and the US at the moment.</p>

<p>As I continue to put the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFHVZYL&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e5f00510-9739-4bdf-ac16-fefc2a381f0e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Watch+Ultra+3&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSFZaWUwvcmVmPWZzX2Ffd3QyX3VzMD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNWYwMDUxMC05NzM5LTRiZGYtYWMxNi1mZWZjMmEzODFmMGUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vZHAvQjBGUUZIVlpZTC9yZWY9ZnNfYV93dDJfdXMwIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdLGuAXWh4NrI7S1UuErnYoSIB05HULJBvw89c6Ek_5h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFHVZYL%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us0" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFHVZYL/ref=fs_a_wt2_us0?th=1">Watch Ultra 3</a> through its paces, it’s worth noting what changes the latest model has over its predecessor. Like I mentioned, it has a larger display while maintaining the same size, thanks to thinner bezels (which Apple said are 24 percent slimmer). It also uses an LTPO 3 panel that enables a faster refresh rate in Always On mode, as well as wide-angle OLEDs for easier reading at off angles.</p>
<p>I’ve found the Watch Ultra 3 lightweight and comfortable to wear so far, and I enjoy tapping buttons or reading messages on its 49mm screen. Unfortunately, I am also a person who wears long-sleeved shirts that are snug at the wrist, making the bigger watches a harder sell, especially as the weather gets colder here in New York. I did find it amusing when the Night mode got triggered any time I tucked the Ultra 3 under my sleeve, turning the watch face’s dials, complications and other elements red.</p>
<p>The Watch Ultra 3 gets the same 5G support, hypertension notifications and Sleep Score as the Series 11, along with watchOS 26 upgrades like Workout Buddy and Liquid Glass. I need a few more days with the Ultra 3 before I can vouch for its 42-hour battery estimate, but it’s nice to see longer runtimes on an endurance watch.</p>
<p>My evaluation of those new features and whether they add up to a meaningful package will be ready soon in a full review. In the meantime, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is available for pre-order and will arrive in stores on September 19.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-3-a-closer-look-at-its-satellite-communications-tools-120012387.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s third-gen pro earbuds make a very strong case for upgrading. Alongside all those iPhones and Watches, Apple revealed the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">AirPods Pro 3</a>, packing in major new features, like live translation and heart-rate sensing, all while tangibly boosting active noise cancellation (ANC).</p>
<p>Those ANC upgrades? Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more noise, while new foam-infused ear tips play a major role here too, since they offer increased passive noise isolation. Apple says these buds cancel twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times more than the original AirPods Pro.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/62714520-92e2-11f0-bf7f-dfe45412c449" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/62714520-92e2-11f0-bf7f-dfe45412c449" style="height:427px;width:640px;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="f5503af5-9a5e-3c74-95c5-25eafec28597"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Then there’s the heart-rate sensors. While the tech debuted on the Powerbeats Pro 2, it’s got a more mainstream home in the AirPods Pro 3. Heart-rate data from the AirPods can be accessed by Apple’s own Fitness app and other workout apps, like Nike Run Club and Peloton. In fact, during his review, Billy Steele found they delivered just as much heart-rate data as his Apple Watch.</p>
<p>There are some minor caveats: Battery life is less than previous models and the new shape of AirPod could take some time getting used to. Still, the newest AirPods garnered a score of 90 in our review. We like them. A lot.</p>

<p>Amazon has a big event coming up and Panos Panay, who leads the company’s Devices &amp; Services team, will be on hand. This strongly suggests Amazon will announce some new hardware. The press invite also included a composite image of various Amazon devices. These appear to include a Kindle ereader, a Fire TV of some kind and an Echo speaker. Those are three of the company’s biggest product categories.</p>

<p>It was a jam-packed Nintendo Direct last Friday. First up, September 13 is the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in Japan, which is a big reason this Direct took place on a Friday. The company revealed the title for the next Mario movie. It’s called <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, and it’s coming to cinemas in the US on April 3. Also, the Virtual Boy is <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html"><ins>coming back</ins></a>!

<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the United States and China have reached a framework deal on TikTok. Speaking to reporters in Madrid after two days of talks with his Chinese counterparts, Bessent said, “It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” President Trump said in a Truth Social post that he will be speaking with Xi Jinping this Friday regarding the potential deal, among other things.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster. I tried out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint's top competitors</a> in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-budgeting-apps-we-tested">Other budgeting apps we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-budgeting-apps">How we test budgeting apps</h2> 
<p>Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-budgeting-app-faqs">Budgeting app FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-plaid-and-how-does-it-work">What is Plaid and how does it work?</h3> 
<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-did-mint-shut-down">Why did Mint shut down?</h3> 
<p>When parent company Intuit <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intuit-is-closing-down-mint-its-popular-free-budget-tracking-app-054145229.html">announced</a> in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. "Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features," Mint wrote on its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/mint-app-news/intuit-credit-karma-welcomes-minters/">product blog</a>. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a>, you have some decent options.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-rocket-money">What about Rocket Money?</h3>

If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether you're all-in on the Apple ecosystem or just want a reliable pair of wireless earbuds, the best AirPods can deliver great sound, seamless pairing and smart features that are hard to beat. Over the years, Apple has expanded its AirPods lineup to suit a variety of users — from the minimalist appeal of the standard models to the premium experience of the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max with plush ear cups and active noise cancellation.<br><br>With rumors of new AirPods on the horizon and the 2nd generation AirPods Pro still going strong, now’s a great time to figure out which model suits you best. Some offer snug silicone tips for better isolation, while others prioritize comfort and simplicity. All of them work effortlessly across your Apple devices, whether you're switching from iPhone to iPad or taking a video call on your laptop.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-you-need-to-know-about-airpods">What you need to know about AirPods</h2> 
<p>When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-4-with-anc">AirPods 4 with ANC</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> represent the first time active noise cancellation has been available on the open-wear, “regular” AirPods. Design-wise, they’re the same as the non-ANC model, so the difference is entirely in the features list. This more expensive version adds Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness and a wireless charging case. The ANC isn’t as powerful as the AirPods Pro 2, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 doesn’t completely seal off your ears. The noise-canceling performance is definitely useful though, working best with constant, low-frequency annoyances like fans and white noise machines. Lastly, you won’t get access to Apple’s hearing test and hearing aid features, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 with ANC doesn’t seal off your ears, which would affect accuracy and effectiveness.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss]]></description>

Of course, it also provides Amazon a way to boost sales during the same time period and, arguably more importantly, increase the number of overall <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c987251c-de7c-4b11-b870-a8c676d060ee&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Prime+subscribers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2FtYXpvbnByaW1lP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM5ODcyNTFjLWRlN2MtNGIxMS1iODcwLWE4YzY3NmQwNjBlZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9hbWF6b25wcmltZSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaeowyo_ITnsLxyXuHanW69CrFZp1N-lDZ00fbJbpFE3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Prime subscribers</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As for the deals we expect, Prime Day(s) is often a boon for discounts on apparel, shoes, household goods and more. Discounts on elecontrics are some of the most sought after, but it can be difficult to decipher if you're actually getting a good deal or not. Here's what we at Engadge think you should keep in mind before shopping during October Prime Day.</p> 
<p><strong>Use a price tracker.</strong> Handy online price trackers like CamelCamelCamel and Keepa show price history charts for items available on Amazon. That way you can see if those earbuds you've been eyeing were $10 cheaper last week, or if the Prime Day price is the lowest in months. You can also add things to your cart or wishlist ahead of Prime Day, and you'll see an alert the next time you visit your cart or wishlist if any items have dropped in price since you added them.</p> 
<p><strong>Shop early, and shop for the big stuff first.</strong> Over the past few years, Amazon has made a habit of releasing solid Prime Day deals in the two weeks leading up to the actual shopping event. Historically, many of those deals stick around through the event itself, so if you seen something on your list drop in price a week before Prime Day, it could be a good time to buy it. It's also wise to look for big-ticket items first like robot vacuums, premium headphones and more when you're shopping an event like this.</p> 
<p><strong>Amazon devices will be some of the best deals.</strong> Most commonly, we see Amazon's own devices — Kindles, Echo speakers, Blink and Ring cameras and more — drop to record-low prices during Prime Day and in the weeks leading up to it. If you have anything like that on your shopping list, we highly recommend waiting until at least the last few days of September to buy any that have early discounts.</p> 
<p><strong>Stock up on stocking stuffers.</strong> We've noticed a trend of affordable tech getting even cheaper during Prime Day over the past couple of years. Think things like wireless chargers, charging cables, power banks, Bluetooth trackers, cheap speakers and more. If you need a few backup charging cables or want to pick up a couple of stocking stuffers early in preparation for the gifting season, definitely use Prime Day deals to your advantage to do that.</p> 
<p><strong>Lightning deals are generally questionable deals.</strong> "Lightning deals" are Amazon's limited-time discounts that are, thankfully, clearly labeled with the amount of time remaining to grab the sale price. In our experience, only a handful of these flash deals are actually worth your money — but if you see something that’s been on your wishlist drop in price for only a few hours, it’s in your best interest to grab it immediately.</p> 
<p>If history is any indication, the sale prices we see during October Prime Day will be similar (and in some cases, the same) as those we see during <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/">Cyber Monday</a>. If you can shop early and cross a few things off your list, we recommend doing so. Engadget will be covering October Prime Day in full, so if you have a lot of tech on your to-buy list, be sure to check back here on Prime Day for the best tech deals we can find.</p>

<p>You'll also see multiple useful additions in the Phone and Messages apps.

We've rounded up a full list of new features you'll have to check out.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-ios-26">What is iOS 26?</h2>
<p>Instead of releasing iOS 19, Apple skipped its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems were released in 2025, they're all designated "26" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues — great news if you don't have a phone that's eligible to run the latest OS.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>
<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a "<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">new translucent material</a>" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>That said, while in beta mode, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html">incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic looks with <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>
<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can now scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call, FaceTime or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation uses Apple Intelligence and it will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends can now create polls in group messages to decide things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>
<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's been frustrated with last year's <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html">changes to the Photos app</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are back. Library and Collections have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-use-the-new-iphone-camera-app-in-ios-26-141038196.html"><strong>Camera app updates</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Navigating the Camera app should be simpler in iOS 26, as all the buttons and menus are in convenient spots — less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens needs to be cleaned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html">FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen is more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-change-your-iphones-snooze-length-in-ios-26-112017653.html"><strong>New alarm setting</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You'll no longer be stuck with the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms. Instead, you now have the option to change your snooze time from one to 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html"><strong>Screenshots look different</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You'll notice several new features when you take a screenshot, including "highlight to search," the option to search your image on Google and ChatGPT is there for any questions you have about the image.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-changes-coming-to-ipados-26">New changes with iPadOS 26</h2>
<p>Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 also has the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look appears on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>
<p>There's more beyond that, so be sure to check out our <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-airpods">What about AirPods?</h2>

<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this "studio-quality" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>
<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html">Live translation is available on AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC when paired with iPhones running iOS 26. Apple says that when someone speaks to you in a different language, you can use your AirPods to translate what they’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring:</strong> Apple introduced new AirPods Pro 3 earbuds this month, which include heart rate monitoring. It will work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-will-siri-get-an-update">Did Siri get an update?</h2>
<p>Siri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point "<a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">in the coming year</a>," so you shouldn't expect any major changes right now. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html">"stripped-down" AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta Connect, the company&#39;s annual event dedicated to all things AR, VR, AI and the metaverse is just days away. And once again, it seems like it will be a big year for smart glasses and AI.</p>
<p>This year, the event will take a slightly different format than in the past. Mark Zuckerberg is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/connect/agenda/">scheduled</a> to kick things off with an evening keynote at 5PM PT on Wednesday, September 17. A developer keynote with other executives will take place the next morning on September 18, beginning at 10AM, with more talks and developer sessions to follow.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear why Meta changed things up this year, but it is shaping up to be a particularly eventful year for Connect. We&#39;re expecting two new models of smart glasses, including Meta&#39;s first to have a display, as well as new Meta AI and metaverse updates. As usual, Engadget will be reporting live from Zuckerberg&#39;s keynote at Meta HQ, but until then, here&#39;s a closer look at what&#39;s coming and what to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-new-and-updated-smart-glasses">New and updated smart glasses</h2>
<p>The biggest news of the day will be Meta&#39;s next-generation of smart glasses. The frames, often referred to by their reported internal name &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/report-meta-could-release-its-first-true-ar-headset-as-soon-as-2027-222502610.html">Hypernova</a>,&quot; will be the first consumer-ready glasses from Meta that have a display. We already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks.</p>
<p>While the frames are expected to have a small display on one side, they won&#39;t offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we&#39;ve seen on Meta&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html">Orion prototype</a>. Instead the display will allow you to view things like notifications and photo previews. The glasses will also come with a dedicated wristband, similar to what the company showed off with Orion, that allows the wearer to control specific features through hand gestures.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a9fe4c50-901a-11f0-bffa-2179f92d70c9" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a9fe4c50-901a-11f0-bffa-2179f92d70c9" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="The EMG wristband that&#39;s part of the Orion prototype." data-uuid="5578445e-a3af-31fb-a0f8-162405934313"><figcaption>The EMG wristband that&#39;s part of the Orion prototype.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The glasses, which are expected to go on sale later this year, will likely cost around $800, according <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html">to reports</a>. And while there was previously some suggestion the glasses may be sold under a different EssilorLuxottica brand, it now seems they will indeed be Ray-Ban branded. On Monday, just days ahead of Connect, a promotional video for &quot;Meta Ray-Ban Display&quot; glasses <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/video-of-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-surfaces-ahead-of-connect-194713365.html">surfaced online</a>. The video showed glasses with clear frames, a heads-up display and a wristband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video doesn&#39;t show a price, but given the likely  higher price tag — most of Meta&#39;s other Ray-Ban-branded glasses cost around $300 — it seems the company is positioning this as a higher-end product that will have a more limited appeal. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658">suggested</a> Hypernova will have a &quot;negligible&quot; share of the overall smart glasses market.</p>
<p>The video also seemingly confirms a new version of Oakley sunglasses, based on the brand&#39;s Sphaera glasses. It shows a pair of the familiar wraparound frames with a single camera in the center near the nose. Those glasses, which have been previously reported, aren&#39;t expected to have a display. Previous leaks have also hinted at new versions of non-display Ray-Ban glasses too, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/renders-of-next-gen-ray-ban-meta-glasses-leak/">leaked renders</a> showing a pair of sunglasses and a version with clear frames.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EssilorLuxottica&#39;s Chief Wearables Officer, Rocco Basilico, has also teased that it will be an &quot;extra special&quot; year at Connect. In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@roccobasilico/post/DOoIKIZEbFF">a post</a> on Threads tagging Meta, he wrote that he was &quot;proud to share what we’ve built together.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could also see new third-party glasses integrations. As <em>UploadVR </em>recently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-agenda-reveals-smart-glasses-sdk/">pointed out,</a> early versions of the Connect schedule for developers seemingly confirms that Meta is getting ready to give developers access to its smart glasses. Up to now, the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within Meta&#39;s ecosystem (with a few exceptions like Spotify and Audible). Allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-meta-ai">Meta AI</h2>
<p>As with other recent years, AI will be a major theme throughout. Meta AI has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-already-has-1-billion-active-users-120023875.html">a billion</a> monthly users (something Zuckerberg will surely remind us of) and I&#39;m expecting to see new features for Meta AI both on the company&#39;s glasses and within its apps. <em>Business Insider</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-hires-contractors-build-ai-chatbot-characters-key-markets-2025-9">reports</a> the company has been working on new lineup of non-English speaking &quot;character-driven&quot; bots for its apps. (Meta&#39;s character-centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny, with the company <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-re-training-its-ai-so-it-wont-discuss-self-harm-or-have-romantic-conversations-with-teens-182418587.html">recently blocking</a> teens&#39; access to many user-generated characters amid growing safety concerns.)</p>
<p>Outside of Meta&#39;s chatbots, I&#39;m hoping Zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create &quot;superintelligence.&quot; As I wrote in July, his <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html">initial manifesto</a> that outlined his vision was confusing at best. The CEO has recently reorganized Meta&#39;s AI teams around the idea, and has been on a very expensive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-invests-148-billion-in-scale-ai-and-recruits-its-ceo-130029612.html">hiring spree</a> to recruit executives and researchers for the effort.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zuckerberg could use Connect to shore up expectations around its Llama models. The company&#39;s larger Llama 4 model has <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-behemoth-llama-4-model-might-still-be-months-away-221240585.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc">been delayed</a> and reports suggest Meta&#39;s engineers have been struggling to improve it. There are other signs that Zuckerberg may be <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html">backing away</a> from open-source AI.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-the-metaverse">What about the metaverse?</h2>
<p>While the metaverse has taken somewhat of a backseat to AI in recent years, it wouldn&#39;t be Connect without some VR-related news. In a recent Instagram post, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth teased &quot;metaverse software&quot; updates related to Horizon Worlds at Connect. The company recently offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-ai-powered-npcs-to-the-metaverse-231605236.html">a preview</a> to developers of its plan to bring AI-powered NPCs to the metaverse, and I expect we&#39;ll hear more about how generative AI could help shape the metaverse.</p>
<p>And while there are no new Quest headsets expected, we could hear more about those third-party VR headsets that will run Meta&#39;s VR software. Last year, the company announced that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-opens-quest-os-to-third-parties-including-asus-and-lenovo-163127396.html">ASUS, Lenovo and Xbox</a> were working on Meta Horizon OS headsets. We haven&#39;t heard too much about these devices since, but there was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1878470166360580199">a leak earlier</a> this year that suggested ASUS would be the first to launch, and that it would include face and eye tracking features.</p>
<div id="269f1b00ffef4fafb3f5260230afab35"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Details on the upcoming ASUS ROG VR headset running Meta Horizon OS.<br><br>It is codenamed Tarius, and will likely be one of the first 3P Horizon OS HMDs to ship.<br><br>It is planned to include Eye Tracking and Face Tracking.

<p>Another intriguing possibility is an update on Meta&#39;s holographic Codec avatars we got <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:20;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-holographic-avatars-will-eventually-be-in-vr-too-235206805.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc">a glimpse</a> of last year.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A regulator has accused NVIDIA of violating China&#39;s antitrust laws over its acquisition of chipmaker Mellanox. In its preliminary findings of an investigation it commenced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/chinese-regulators-are-investigating-nvidia-for-potential-antitrust-violations-200136726.html"><ins>in December</ins></a>, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) claimed that the company breached both national regulations and the conditional terms China outlined when it rubberstamped the $6.9 billion takeover. The SAMR hasn&#39;t announced any penalties yet, as the investigation will continue.</p>
<p>The SAMR is said to have determined its preliminary findings several weeks ago. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa7a2e35-df03-45a1-bd0b-3f7207a7d84b"><em><ins>Financial Post</ins></em></a> sources, the regulator held off from releasing its statement until now, as trade talks with the US take place in Madrid, with the idea of giving Chinese officials more leverage. (Those talks have so far resulted in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tiktok-deal-may-finally-be-happening-160448732.html"><ins>a framework agreement for TikTok</ins></a>.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NVIDIA and Mellanox <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-11-nvidia-acquisition-mellanox.html"><ins>announced the buyout</ins></a> back in 2019. China approved it in April the following year on the condition that NVIDIA continued to supply GPUs and interconnect products to the country and adhere to “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory principles,” per the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3325595/tech-war-china-finds-us-chip-giant-nvidia-violated-anti-monopoly-law"><em><ins>South China Morning Post</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Last month, it was reported that China was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html">discouraging</a> companies in the country from buying NVIDIA&#39;s H20 chips pending a national security review. Officials were said to have taken offense at remarks from Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary. After the US allowed NVIDIA to start offering chips to China again in July following a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-says-it-can-resume-selling-key-ai-chips-to-china-120015817.html"><ins>three-month ban</ins></a>, Lutnick said the company wasn&#39;t going to be selling its most cutting-edge tech there.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it,&quot; he told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/howard-lutnick-says-china-is-only-getting-nvidias-4th-best-ai-chip.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. &quot;The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-says-nvidias-mellanox-acquisition-violated-antitrust-law-200409929.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, New York joined the wave of states passing legislation aimed at protecting minors using the Internet, particularly social media. Governor Kathy Hochul <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-governor-signs-two-new-bills-into-law-protecting-kids-from-social-media-211935749.html"><ins>signed</ins></a> the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act and the New York Child Data Protection Act in June 2024. Today, the state&#39;s Attorney General Letitia James released more <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-releases-proposed-rules-safe-kids-act-restrict-addictive">specifics</a> about what the SAFE for Kids Act will entail in practice. Public comment is open until December 1 and the rules must be finalized within a year from that date.</p>
<p>In particular, the rule will require online platforms to confirm the ages of users before showing them algorithmically-curated feeds or sending them notifications at night. The Attorney General&#39;s approach allows sites to choose their method of age verification, as long as the approach &quot;are shown to be effective and protect users’ data.&quot; New York will also require an age confirmation method that does not rely on having a government-issued ID.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There is also a component of parental consent in the SAFE for Kids Act. Minors must request a social media network to seek parental permission for accessing algorithmic feeds or receiving nighttime notifications. If parental consent is not granted, the platforms may not block minors from generally accessing their service or content. Both the minor and their parent may revoke their consent at any time.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposed rules released by my office today will help us tackle the youth mental health crisis and make social media safer for kids and families,&quot; James said in the announcement. &quot;This is an issue that affects all of us, and I encourage parents, educators, young people, industry groups, and others to review the proposed rules and submit a comment during the public comment period.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/new-york-details-its-plans-for-online-age-verification-rules-195223379.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has apparently updated its Steam Early Access policy to no longer accept games with what the company deems to be &quot;mature themes.&quot; As first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/business/pressure-continues-steam-denies-early-access-release-for-adult-games-ed57cc6bd4b4e60ee9663c5f90a1b797"><em><ins>Gamesmarkt</ins></em></a> earlier this month, gaming studio Dammitbird, which develops the adult adventure game <em>Heavy Hearts</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/GalewindG/status/1961949585254826238">was not allowed</a> to put the title on Steam Early Access because of its content.</p>
<p>Payment processors like Mastercard and Visa have been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html"><ins>mounting a pressure campaign</ins></a> on video game marketplaces Steam and Itch.io to remove certain adults-only content since early summer. After <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.newsweek.com/no-mercy-game-us-2058679"><ins>taking down</ins></a> a game called <em>No Mercy</em> in April at the behest of payment processors and an <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-and-stolen-puritanical-valor-234220878.html"><ins>Australian anti-porn organization</ins></a>, there has been a steady expansion in the application of these new policies.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Steam, for its part, made some incredibly vague policy changes to appease the payment giants, adding a sweeping clause that promises to ban certain kinds of adults-only content before <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html"><ins>proceeding to remove</ins></a> hundreds of games. Itch.io made <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq"><ins>similar changes</ins></a> before <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html"><ins>removing more than 20,000 titles</ins></a> from its marketplace. Steam has removed hundreds of titles that we know of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparent scope creep is of particular concern to small independent developers whose fairly innocuous games <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html"><ins>like </ins><em><ins>VILE: Exhumed</ins></em></a> were banned from Steam and delisted from Itch.io. <em>Exhumed</em> is a mostly text-based game whose limited imagery and innuendo is worlds away from the sort of adult games that were first banned when this whole saga kicked off.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is how card payments are policed. Stores like Steam and Itch.io don’t contract with Visa or Mastercard directly but with acquiring banks and processors that must enforce the card networks’ brand-safety and anti-trafficking rules. This can end up influencing how <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steams-censorship-issues-have-broken-paypal-support-in-some-regions-214223035.html"><ins>companies like PayPal</ins></a> work with Steam across different regions, depending on how banks in those areas are responding to the pressure exerted by Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>The confusion will continue to cause consternation among developers and consumers alike until policies on these platforms are made clearer, or payment processors relieve some of the pressure by clarifying their own standards.</p>
<p>Engadget has reached out to Valve for comment and will update if we hear back.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/early-access-is-the-latest-place-where-steam-is-restricting-games-with-mature-themes-190806818.html?src=rss]]></description>

The xboom Buds Plus and Buds Lite (which seems like a relatively confusing name to beer drinkers) both hit store shelves sometime this month.</p>
<p>The Buds Plus earbuds are filled with high-tech bells and whistles. These premium headphones boast adaptive EQ that continuously adjusts the sound profile in real time. This should ensure &quot;optimal audio quality regardless of how the earbuds are worn.&quot; The company says the design compensates for changes that would lead to signal degradation with other earbuds.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/d3eeb0c0-925b-11f0-bdbb-818686443fbf" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/d3eeb0c0-925b-11f0-bdbb-818686443fbf" style="height:1460px;width:2200px;" alt="Some earbuds." data-uuid="83748e47-2870-3a81-869e-f922d8d0ac46"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure>
<p>They include ANC and a trio of microphones for making phone calls and the like. The charging case sanitizes the earbuds after each use with UV rays, with the company claiming that the process eliminates 99.9 percent of bacteria from the surface. This case also doubles as a Bluetooth transmitter, which is useful when enjoying some in-flight entertainment. It supports wireless charging, which is nice, with up to ten hours of playback per charge on the buds and 30 hours with the case.</p>
<p>The Buds Lite earbuds have one advantage over the standard Buds and the Buds Plus. The battery lasts up to 11.5 hours per charge, with the case bringing that up to 35 hours. Otherwise, these are standard earbuds that offer &quot;clear, balanced audio for music, calls and more.&quot;</p>
<p>They offer ANC, though a more streamlined version than with the Plus, and four customizable EQ modes. This allows users to &quot;fine-tune their sound profile to match their preferences.&quot; The Buds Lite ship with several different ear tips to accommodate multiple ear canal sizes.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/08e02840-925c-11f0-93ff-744e781d1f1c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/08e02840-925c-11f0-93ff-744e781d1f1c" style="height:874px;width:1561px;" alt="Will.i.am standing with devices." data-uuid="a0f119d6-ca83-35d9-bcac-1fd58dfb2307"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure>
<p>LG hasn&#39;t revealed any pricing info on these products, but the original xboom Buds cost $109. It&#39;s a safe bet the Buds Plus will cost more than that. Hopefully, the Buds Lite will cost a bit less.</p>

<p>While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025, as a few models are getting the axe this time around. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to receive the boot in 2023, and this year, iPhones released in 2018 will be left behind. If your device is ineligible, Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues, so you can at least download that.</p>

<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-when-will-ios-26-become-available"><strong>When will iOS 26 become available?</strong></h2>
<p>As of today, Monday, September 15, you can officially download and install iOS 26.&nbsp;</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a summer of beta updates, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">iOS 26</a> is here. As long as you have a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-arrives-on-monday-find-out-if-your-iphone-is-eligible-for-the-free-update-191854034.html">compatible iPhone</a>, you can install the new software right now. Head to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>, and get ready for a Liquid Glass makeover.</p>
<p>iOS 26 offers <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Apple&#39;s biggest visual change to its software</a> since iOS 7. (That was when Jony Ive&#39;s flat design replaced Scott Forstall&#39;s skeuomorphic one.) This time around, the software adopts a translucent material theme: Liquid Glass. Although it isn&#39;t a return to skeuomorphism, it does reincorporate a sense of depth, simulating a pleasantly refractive glass. Expect colors and visual effects that respond to their onscreen surroundings.</p>

<p>Apple has taken flak from industry pundits for not rushing headfirst into AI. (Or, at least it hasn&#39;t with the same manic frenzy as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-recap-ai-updates-android-xr-google-beam-and-everything-else-announced-at-the-annual-keynote-175900229.html">its competitors</a>.) The company is taking a more measured approach, gradually incorporating it into its software. This year&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-intelligence-announcements-at-wwdc-everything-apple-revealed-for-ios-macos-and-more-171133645.html">Apple Intelligence additions</a> include live translation in messages, FaceTime and Phone. Visual Intelligence also expands beyond the camera and into screenshots. And your Genmoji and Image Playground creations might look less… strange than last year&#39;s versions.</p>
<p>Even Apple Music gets a new AI feature. Its new automix generates transitions between songs, aiming for DJ-like progressions. I find that it works best with danceable genres like EDM or hip-hop. It usually won&#39;t bother trying to mix less beat-driven singer-songwriter-type stuff.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/816a71a0-8ffd-11f0-bec3-dcf91c4b8d91" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/816a71a0-8ffd-11f0-bec3-dcf91c4b8d91" style="height:528px;width:938px;" alt="Screenshot of live translation in iOS 26 messages." data-uuid="05eb9c82-173a-34d4-9128-a46438bc4a25"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure>
<p>Arguably handier than new AI features is Apple&#39;s revamp of its communication apps. Call screening lets you gather info from callers before deciding whether to pick up. Hold Assist saves you from having to listen to the Muzak. And the Messages app adds new screening options and filters. You can also add custom backgrounds and even conduct polls in your messaging threads. Finally, the Phone app cleans up its interface, unifying its tabs into a single list.</p>
<p>There&#39;s much more on tap, of course. For that, you can check out <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">Engadget&#39;s iOS 26 preview</a>.</p>

Apple&#39;s other software updates are here today, too. iPadOS 26 gives the tablet its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">most Mac-like productivity boost to date</a>. watchOS 26 <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">adds sleep scores and an AI coach</a>.

All of those (along with <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-visionos-26-brings-eye-scrolling-and-support-for-ps-vr2-controllers-180651833.html">visionOS 26</a> and tvOS 26, which still exist) adopt the new Liquid Glass aesthetic.

It truly is teensy, resembling an Apple TV streaming box more than a desktop computer. All told, it's five-inches by five-inches across and two inches tall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>There are two front-facing USB-C ports, which is extremely handy. The back of the computer boasts even more ports, including Thunderbolt, HDMI and Ethernet. As indicated by the name, this thing features the speedy M4 chip. The processor can easily handle garden variety computing tasks, like watching content, but also excels with creative pursuits like making music and editing videos.</p> 
<p>This desktop doesn't include an SD card reader, which could be a dealbreaker for those looking for an easy way to add more storage. We also found that the fan got loud every once in a while when dealing with heavy workloads. Otherwise, this is a near-perfect (and adorable) computer.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-reach-framework-deal-tiktok-trump-xi-speak-friday-2025-09-15/"><ins>has said</ins></a> that the United States and China have reached a framework deal on TikTok. Speaking to reporters in Madrid after two days of talks with his Chinese counterparts, Bessent said, “It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” President Trump said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://wordtohtml.net/These%20comments%20come%20ahead%20of%20planned%20conversations%20between%20President%20Trump%20and%20Xi%20Jinping,%20expected%20to%20be%20held%20on%20Friday."><ins>Truth Social post</ins></a> that he will be speaking with Xi Jinping this Friday regarding the potential deal, among other things.</p>
<p>This breakthrough comes after the Trump administration extended the TikTok ban for a third time earlier this summer, giving the company until September 17 to undergo a sale or face a ban in the United States. The short-form video content app faced increasing scrutiny over national security concerns due to the Chinese ownership of its parent company, ByteDance.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>President Trump issued an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-tiktok-us-microsoft-190552645.html"><ins>executive order</ins></a> in August 2020 banning the app in the United States unless it was divested from ByteDance, though <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/07/944039053/u-s-judge-halts-trumps-tiktok-ban-the-2nd-court-to-fully-block-the-action"><ins>courts halted</ins></a> enforcement of the order. In 2024 the United States Congress passed the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521"><ins>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA)</ins></a> which was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html"><ins>signed into law</ins></a> by then-President Biden. The Trump administration has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of that law in hopes a deal could be made for a US-based acquisition, leaving the app online in the meantime.</p>
<p>As it stands, this appears to be a framework for how TikTok could come under some level of US control, and not a signed final deal. Companies from <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-denies-talks-with-oracle-about-a-tiktok-deal-but-says-a-decision-will-likely-be-made-within-30-days-163755199.html"><ins>Oracle</ins></a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/what-will-happen-to-tiktok-a-look-at-the-potential-buyers-000110723.html"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, and the president is <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-tiktok-us-microsoft-190552645.html"><ins>on record</ins></a> as saying he would be OK if a &quot;very American company&quot; buys it. It&#39;s unclear if the September 17 deadline will be pushed once again, but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that another delay may be needed in order to get the deal signed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tiktok-deal-may-finally-be-happening-160448732.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-wireless-earbuds">What to look for in the best wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">AirPods</a> or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.</p> 
<p>For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.</p> 
<p>When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.</p> 
<p>Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.</p> 
<p>We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-labels-say-apple-musics-spatial-audio-royalties-only-benefit-the-biggest-player-211730447.html">Spatial Audio</a>, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-wireless-earbuds">How we test wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).</p> 
<p>To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-we-tested">Other wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wf-c710n">Sony WF-C710N</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-c710n-review-more-than-midrange-180018400.html">WF-C710N</a> is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-powerbeats-pro-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</h3> 
<p>The newest version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-buds-3">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-and-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review-airpods-clones-that-actually-deliver-171024116.html">Galaxy Buds 3</a> combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sennheiser-momentum-sport">Sennheiser Momentum Sport</h3> 
<p>I really like the overall shape of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review-fitness-earbuds-that-lack-finesse-130036233.html">Momentum Sport</a> earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-solo-buds">Beats Solo Buds</h3> 
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-solo-buds-review-exactly-what-youd-expect-for-80-170742296.html">Solo Buds</a> for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-ultra-open-earbuds">Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</h3> 
<p>Bose created something very unique for <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">this set of earbuds</a> that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-audio-technica-ath-twx7">Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-twx7-review-good-earbuds-with-frustrating-flaws-160054450.html">These stick buds</a> have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mw09">Master &amp; Dynamic MW09</h3> 
<p>Retooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master--dynamic-mw09-review-premium-materials-impeccable-clarity-132522028.html">MW09</a> has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-considered-good-battery-life-for-true-wireless-earbuds">What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Most wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.</p>

<p>Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is also outstanding.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-wireless-earbuds-have-the-longest-battery-life">Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?</h3> 
<p>With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-audio-technica-ath-cks5tw-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW</a>. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08</a> offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-are-waterproof">What wireless earbuds are waterproof?</h3> 
<p>There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-earbuds-stay-in-ears-the-best">Which earbuds stay in ears the best?</h3> 
<p>A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-work-with-ps5">What wireless earbuds work with PS5?</h3> 
<p>PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-inzone-gaming-monitors-headsets-specs-pricing-availability-210056794.html">Sony’s own gaming headsets</a> come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t exactly know what the company will reveal, but we do have a giant clue. The press invite also included a composite image of various Amazon devices. These appear to include a Kindle ereader, a Fire TV of some kind and an Echo speaker. Those are three of the company&#39;s biggest product categories.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve gotten a new entry-level Kindle, though Amazon did recently refresh both the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html"><ins>Scribe</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html"><ins>Colorsoft</ins></a>. It&#39;s also possible the company will announce a refresh of the Paperwhite ereader.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a similar story with Echo speakers. The company recently refreshed the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html"><ins>Echo Dot</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-unveils-the-40-echo-pop-a-semi-spherical-smart-speaker-140026706.html"><ins>Echo Pop</ins></a>, along with the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/echo-show-8-3rd-gen-hands-on-174000825.html"><ins>Echo Show 8</ins></a>, but it&#39;s been nearly five years since it redesigned the standard Echo speaker. It&#39;s possible the company&#39;s speakers will be getting some kind of new integration with the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html"><ins>Alexa+ smart assistant</ins></a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a couple of years since we&#39;ve gotten a big influx of new Fire TVs and related streaming sticks, so those could also be on the docket. However, that part of the invite image is a bit fuzzy and might be advertising an upcoming tablet and not new TVs. In any event, we only have a couple of weeks before finding out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-may-be-announcing-new-echo-and-kindle-devices-on-september-30-152044048.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, rising prices for streaming services feels as inevitable as death and taxes. So when a serious discount is available, we tend to sit up and take notice. For a few weeks, you can get a whopping half off an annual subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount Plus;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=855ca62e-ee52-453f-91a1-14fbe4f4bd6a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;linkText=Paramount%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1NWNhNjJlLWVlNTItNDUzZi05MWExLTE0ZmJlNGY0YmQ2YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFyYW1vdW50cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOKUU1vXUXbEUW7l4rCKNUFLhf9Zv8VyJSYD7ySdLSg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.paramountplus.com/">Paramount+</a>. A year of the Paramount+ Essential plan, which is ad-supported, will cost $30 compared to the usual $60. Paramount+ Premium, which is ad-free except for live tv programming, will cost $60 for a year instead of $120.</p> 
<p> <core-commerce id="3bdb2f3abd5e487ea7660b9423be2e46" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.paramountplus.com"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer. Anyone who signs up for a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">Paramount+</a> from now through September 18 will be able to get this pricing. The only real caveat with this deal is that you have to pay for the full year in advance; month-to-month subscriptions will still cost the usual rate.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Paramount+ has some great programming options, particularly if you're a fan of anything involving RuPaul. It's also the home of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-third-season-falls-short-of-its-second-020030139.html"><em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-lower-decks-ends-on-a-new-beginning-140003832.html"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, which are arguably the best modern additions to the sci-fi show's canon, as well as the other past and present <em>Star Trek</em> series. The platform offers a solid lineup of sports as well. And if you opt to go for the Premium plan, you'll also be granted access to Showtime titles such as <em>Yellowjackets</em> and the rebooted <em>Dexter: Resurrection</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html">Awe Dropping event</a> started with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKphYoxGeRE">dramatic health testimonials</a> from Apple Watch users, then revealed a key new feature for the new Watch Series 11: hypertension alerts. The function had yet to receive FDA clearance at the time, but that has now been granted, as first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/apple-watch-hypertension-detection-coming-next-week-after-fda-nod"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and confirmed by Apple. As a result, it will reportedly be available to users in 150 countries when the Watch 11 and Ultra Watch 3 ship starting on September 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypertension alerts can help detect hypertension (high blood pressure), a potentially dangerous condition that affects over a billion people. The feature relies on the Watch&#39;s optical heart sensor, but now uses new machine learning algorithm that also draws from a study involving more than 100,000 participants to look for high blood pressure. It works in the background a month-long period to seek patterns associated with hypertension. Unlike devices that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shop.yhetechs.com/products/bp-doctor-fit">measure your specific blood pressure</a>, it only tells users that there may be a danger.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Last year, Apple received FDA clearance for its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apples-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-will-work-on-airpods-pro-154814439.html">over-the-counter Hearing Aid function</a> that transforms the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">second-gen AirPods Pro</a> into OTC hearing aids for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Another recently approved feature is <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-brings-sleep-apnea-detection-to-the-watch-series-10-172316987.html">sleep apnea detection</a>. However, the company is currently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html">facing a lawsuit</a> over the Apple Watch&#39;s redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Correction, September 15, 2025, 10:27AM ET:</strong> This article and its headline originally stated that the Apple Watch received FDA approval for the new hypertension alerts feature. It received FDA clearance, which is a lower level of authorization compared to FDA approval. We apologize for this error.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-clearance-for-hypertension-alerts-120046138.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Anker says the 622 Magnetic Battery can recharge a dead iPhone 16 or 16 Pro to just over 80 percent, and an iPhone 16 Pro Max to just over 60 percent. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-622-magsafe-battery-pack-irl-143059141.html">hands-on review</a> of the portable charger, we liked the magnetic stand that folds out into a 30-degree angle. Users can rotate their phone to either portrait mode or landscape mode while charging.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The Anker 622 is an older charger, so it outputs a maximum of 7.5W when charging wirelessly. If you need to refill your battery faster than that, you might want to pick up one of the newer Qi2 power banks. Though a Qi2 power bank will, of course, cost more, some of our favorites are having great sales right now.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There must be something in the water at Spotify HQ. Less than a week after <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-lossless-streaming-is-finally-here-and-its-included-with-a-premium-plan-131009528.html">delivering long-promised lossless audio</a>, the company has another treat. Free listeners can finally listen to any track they want. After enhancing Premium, perhaps Spotify figured it could add a free perk without shedding subscribers.</p>
<p>Spotify accounts on the free plan can now choose any track and immediately listen to it. Previously, that was paywalled for Premium subscribers. Non-paying ones had to shuffle through an album or playlist until the song they wanted to hear came up. And the free tier&#39;s limited skips meant you might have to wait a while to get to it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now you can choose any track you want by searching, selecting it in an album or playlist or tapping a shared one. The feature rolls out globally beginning today. However, the free plan&#39;s other limits haven&#39;t changed, so you&#39;ll need to listen to ads and choose your limited skips wisely.</p>
<p>Pre-existing features of Spotify&#39;s free tier include personalized recommendations, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/spotify-debuts-an-in-app-cover-art-maker-for-playlists-130026423.html">AI playlist covers</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-latest-playlist-auto-adapts-to-your-day-122541712.html">&quot;daylists.&quot;</a> If you can live without hi-fi audio, offline playback or ad-free listening, the view from the cheap seats is better than ever.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/free-spotify-users-can-finally-listen-to-any-track-immediately-130013081.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap is upgrading the software that powers its augmented reality glasses as it gets ready for the first <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html"><ins>non-developer version</ins></a> of its &quot;Specs&quot; next year. The latest update to Snap OS  includes an improved web browser, as well as the ability to browse Spotlight videos in AR.</p>
<p>The company has long said that one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/launch-specs-2026"><ins>its goals</ins></a> for AR glasses is to enable people to spend less time staring at their phones. Snap hasn&#39;t quite accomplished that yet,  but Snap OS is starting to get more features that could help the company get there.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has redesigned the browser in Snap OS to make it easier to switch between sites and resize windows to different aspect ratios. It&#39;s also faster and more power efficient, with the ability to watch around 40 minutes of continuous video playback. (The current version of Spectacles tops out at around 45 minutes of battery life.) Speaking of video, Spectacles is also getting a dedicated lens for browsing Spotlight, Snapchat&#39;s short-form video platform. There&#39;s also a new gallery lens that allows you to preview photos you&#39;ve snapped with the glasses&#39; onboard camera and quickly scroll through them with hand gestures.</p>
<p>The update arrives one year after the company first showed off its somewhat goofy-looking AR glasses. Since then, hundreds of developers have been experimenting with the device and creating their own AR lenses for the platform. But those experiences have so far had a very limited reach as the company has only made its AR Spectacles available to developers willing t<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snaps-fifth-generation-spectacles-bring-your-hands-into-into-augmented-reality-180026541.html"><ins>o pay a pricey subscription</ins></a>. That&#39;s set to change sometime in 2026, though, when Snap says it will start selling a smaller, lighter and more capable pair of glasses.</p>
<p>The company has yet to divulge details about the redesigned form factor or what powers &quot;Specs&quot; will have. But the new version of Snap OS shows the company is trying to make its AR platform more useful.</p>

It was designed to work the company's <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-hands-on-the-unibody-and-camera-plateau-feel-more-significant-in-person-185553855.html">new iPhone 17 models</a> with faster charging speeds than previous iPhones.</p> 
<p>Lugging heavy chargers is a particularly bugbear of mine so the Dynamic Power Adapter stands out with a footprint not much bigger than the smallest 40W chargers. With AVS, it can provide a specific power level that's ideal for what a given device needs at specific times in its charge cycle. To that end, it can hit up 60W but only for a limited time period of around 18 minutes, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1nfhctl/hands_on_review_apples_4060w_dynamic_power_adapter/">according to one tester</a>.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>"With Dynamic Power, you get many of the same benefits of higher-wattage chargers in a compact, pocket-size form factor," the Apple explains in the product description. "For faster charging, pair [it] with iPhone 17 models (50 percent battery in around 20 minutes) or iPhone Air (50 percent battery in around 30 minutes)."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With its fold down prongs it'll easily slide into a pocket and not weigh you down like regular 60W chargers. For instance, Anker's popular Nano II 65W GaN charger is one of the smaller options available but is still about twice the size of Apple's new model. However, due to the limited time at higher wattages, it won't be suitable for charging laptops like some third-party models. The other rub is the price: The 40W Dynamic Power Adapter <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e217e970-c2a6-42e1-bb24-32ff440063b2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=costs+%2440&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HS040QU0vQS80MHctZHluYW1pYy1wb3dlci1hZGFwdGVyLXdpdGgtNjB3LW1heCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTIxN2U5NzAtYzJhNi00MmUxLWJiMjQtMzJmZjQ0MDA2M2IyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HS040QU0vQS80MHctZHluYW1pYy1wb3dlci1hZGFwdGVyLXdpdGgtNjB3LW1heCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfB7tYPdQrF78N9rPhH0UYQiJ7N1QxcsKYz798b-wFh-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMGKN4AM%2FA%2F40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKN4AM/A/40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max">costs $40</a>, almost twice as much as Anker's 65W charger.</p>

And with a notable improvement in battery life, the company now provides enough power for you to use these AirPods for an entire work day. Importantly, Apple managed to do all this without raising the price.</p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 also carry many of the same features that made the AirPods Pro 2 such a compelling option for iPhone users. Those include the robust <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-take-apples-hearing-test-with-the-airpods-pro-2-173014978.html">hearing health tools</a>, hands-free access to Siri, gesture-based notification interactions, audio sharing with another set of AirPods, simplified setup and more.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Since I’ve gone over all of these at length before, and because there’s a long list of updates on the AirPods Pro 3, I’ve chosen to focus primarily on the new tools in this review. But you shouldn’t overlook the exhaustive set of features that the AirPods Pro have amassed over the years, especially when you consider how Apple continues to find new ways to deploy its H2 chip.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-changes-on-the-airpods-pro-3">Design changes on the AirPods Pro 3</h2> 
<p>With a cursory glance, you likely won’t notice the design changes on the AirPods Pro 3. The company altered the shape of these smaller earbuds to align with the geometry of the ear canal for a more comfortable and secure fit. Of course, you’ll also notice the newly installed heart-rate sensor upon closer inspection, covering a previously blank surface of the AirPods Pro 2. Once you remove the new foam-infused ear tips from the latest model though, you’ll see the most obvious variation between the second- and third-generation versions.</p> 
<p>On the AirPods Pro 2, the grille protecting the driver sat flush with the surface of the main housing. Now, it’s extended out from the rest of the earbud, with a nozzle-like component similar to what much of the competition uses. Apple also revised the angle of the drivers, so sound beams more directly into your ears rather than bouncing as much off of the sides. As such, a side-by-side comparison of the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods Pro 2 will show you that the ear tips are pointing in slightly different directions.</p> 
<p>There are also some visual differences on the AirPods Pro 3’s charging case. Like it did for the AirPods 4 last year, Apple has removed the Bluetooth pairing button entirely. You’ll now double tap on the front of the case near the LED to activate that function while the AirPods Pro are in their case. Additionally, just like AirPods 4, the LED is now hidden, so you don’t see the dot when it’s not illuminated. It’s a small thing, but as I noticed on last year’s models, it makes the surface of the case look cleaner.</p>

<p>Thanks to the AirPods Pro 3’s revised curves and foam-filled ear tips, Apple is calling this model the “best-fitting AirPods ever.” While I do think that’s true, I also believe that the new fit will take some getting used to — especially if you’ve worn the AirPods Pro 2 before.</p> 
<p>First, the new tips feel very different and seal off your ear canal in a more complete way than the Pro 2’s silicone-only tips. If you’ve used foam ear tips before, you know they provide better passive noise isolation than their silicone counterparts, and that remains true here. In fact, you may need to go down a size to find the most comfortable fit with the AirPods Pro 3. For example, I typically wear medium ear tips, but those felt too tight here. After swapping them out for the small ones, I began to understand why Apple won’t stop bragging about the updated fit.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-upgraded-anc-and-its-impact-on-other-features">Upgraded ANC and its impact on other features</h2> 
<p>Across the first two generations of the AirPods Pro, Apple had already made big strides in active noise cancellation. But with the AirPods Pro 3, the company ramped up its efforts several notches. Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise. The new foam-infused ear tips play a major role here too, since they offer increased passive noise isolation. This trio of improvements allowed Apple to cover more of the noise spectrum, including higher frequencies like human voices.</p> 
<p>In the last week, there have been several times when I had the AirPods Pro 3 in and I couldn’t hear someone talking right next to me. In fact, Apple says the latest model cancels twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times more than the original AirPods Pro. Obviously, I don’t have a way to quantify that, but I can tell you the ANC performance on this new model was noticeably stronger than before.</p> 
<p>The improved seal the AirPods Pro 3’s ear tips offer helps make Apple’s ANC setup more precise. This allows the active noise cancellation system to be the foundation for several of the company’s other features like the Hearing Test, Live Translation and more. For the Hearing Test, you can now be in slightly louder environments without Siri asking you to relocate to a quieter place. And with Live Translation, ANC will lower the voice of the person you’re speaking to so you can focus on Siri playing the role of interpreter.</p>

<p>At WWDC, Apple announced that Live Translation would be coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">in iOS 26</a>. There was no mention then that it would come to AirPods. Skip ahead to the iPhone 17 event and Live Translation was easily one of the most exciting new features announced for the AirPods Pro 3, because it will allow the wearer to translate in-person conversations with Apple’s earbuds.</p> 
<p>Google has been offering real-time translation on Pixel Buds <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-25-google-pixel-buds-review.html">for years</a>, so Apple is very late to the game here. However, the AirPods Pro 3 uses its H2 chip in different ways, and now combines Voice Isolation, ANC and the beamforming mics to enable Live Translation. What’s more, you can activate it on the earbuds themselves (press and hold on both stems), ask Siri to start it or set the iPhone’s Action Button to carry out the task.</p> 
<p>When Live Translation begins, ANC kicks in to muffle environmental noise and to reduce the volume of the person you’re speaking to. Both are done so you can clearly hear Siri’s translation through your AirPods. Siri will warn you when ambient sound levels are too high, asking you to move to a quieter spot so that it can hear the speaker better.</p> 
<p>Live Translation worked well, at least for my Spanish-to-English and French-to-English tests. Plus, a real-time transcription is visible in the Translate app so you can show it to the person you’re chatting with — an element that’ll be useful for international travel. Just know that if you’re looking at your phone too, you’ll see the translation there before the audio comes through your AirPods. This isn’t surprising since the processing is being done by the connected iPhone, but seeing the English version right before I heard it was slightly confusing.</p> 
<p>You will need to enable Apple Intelligence on a compatible iPhone for Live Translation to work. The tool leverages Apple’s AI to translate the meanings of phrases so that sentences have the proper context. The feature will also be available on any AirPods that have the H2 chip inside, which includes the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC. You’ll have to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/translate-text-voice-and-conversations-iphd74cb450f/ios#:~:text=Download%20languages%20for%20offline%20translation%20or%20On-Device%20Mode">download the different language models</a> before you get started, too. Apple explains that the downloads would be required for offline use, but Siri prompted me to do so to use Live Translation even when I was was connected. Lastly, only five languages are supported at launch: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. Apple says Italian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese (simplified) are coming later this year.</p>

<p>After initially debuting heart-rate sensing capabilities on <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">the Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, Apple is now bringing it to the AirPods Pro 3. Like with the Powerbeats model, heart rate data from the AirPods can be accessed by Apple’s own Fitness app in addition to other workout apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder and Peloton. Basically, if an app works with the Powerbeats Pro 2, it should work with the AirPods Pro 3, and it should do so by the time those earbuds ship. As always, I expect even more integrations will be announced in the future, so don’t panic if your go-to app has worked with Apple gear in the past but doesn’t yet support the AirPods Pro 3.</p> 
<p>I exclusively tested the new heart-rate sensing tech on the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s Fitness app. I’m an Apple Watch owner and that’s where the bulk of my stats already reside. Speaking of the Watch, you don’t have to worry about conflicting streams of heart rate info if you’re using it as well as the AirPods Pro 3 during a workout. Apple explained that its devices will work together to provide multiple streams of data for better coverage of your activity. What’s more, if you don’t wear your Apple Watch during a session, the Fitness app will use data gathered from the AirPods Pro 3 to still log your stats for your Move, Exercise and Stand rings.</p> 
<p>During this review, I used the AirPods Pro 3 to monitor my heart rate primarily during outdoor walks. The earbuds actually support 50 different workouts in the Fitness app though, with HIIT, yoga and paddling among the available options. You can even track a session at the archery range.</p> 
<p>You’ll see live heart rate metrics on the workout screen alongside stats like time and distance, and your average heart rate will be displayed in the workout summary when you’re done. Heart rate info is also displayed with Live Activities on the lock screen and is a tap away on the icon in the Dynamic Island. So far, I haven’t encountered any issues leaving my Watch at home and relying solely on the AirPods Pro 3. The earbuds provided a constant stream of data to the Fitness app.</p>

<p>The improvement to sound quality on the AirPods Pro 3 isn’t exclusively due to its new drivers/transducers. Although those components were revised this generation, Apple’s biggest strides in the audio department are also thanks to increased air flow inside the earbuds. The company developed a new multiport acoustic architecture for better control of the air that delivers sounds into the ear. This allowed Apple to significantly improve bass response while providing a wider soundstage and increased vocal clarity.</p> 
<p>With all of that air to move around, Apple had to tweak its drivers for the task, but also make sure its tuning covered all the needed frequencies adequately. But those transducers remain the same size as the AirPods Pro 2. As I mentioned, Apple also reconfigured their angle so they now beam sound more directly into the ear canal. You might recall that an angular adjustment was also part of the company’s strategy for improving audio quality on the AirPods 4.</p> 
<p>The improvement you hear first will depend on the style of music you choose. Pick something with big, bombastic drums like Deftones’ “my mind is a mountain” and you’ll immediately notice the warmer, boomier bass. Opt for a track like Hayley Williams’ “True Believer” and your initial impression will likely be the enhanced vocal quality. And if you go for a song like Sleep Token’s “Dangerous” that’s more atmospheric, you’ll get a great sense of the expanded soundstage.</p> 
<p>Oftentimes audio companies make claims about sound quality improvements that don’t translate to what I actually hear. With the AirPods Pro 3, all of Apple’s proclamations not only hold true but are obvious, observable improvements.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-call-quality-and-voice-performance">Call quality and voice performance</h2> 
<p>Apple’s best-in-class transparency mode has been one of my favorite things about AirPods for years. No other company manages to handle ambient sound in a way that’s so clear it’s almost as if you aren’t wearing earbuds at all. With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple says it took things even further, making your voice and the voices of those around you sound “more natural and vibrant.” The company points specifically to Hearing Aid and Live Translation as areas where this fine-tuned transparency mode will help, but it will also be a boost to voice and video calls, too.</p> 
<p>Since Apple does such a good job of feeding your voice back through the AirPods Pro 3 and other transparency-enabled AirPods models, you never feel the need to talk louder to hear yourself on calls. It lets you relax and speak normally, and makes a day’s worth of Zoom calls much less exhausting.</p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 support Apple’s newly introduced <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">studio-quality voice recording</a> as well. Arriving with iOS 26, the feature allows you to capture higher-quality vocal clips in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages, FaceTime and any CallKit-enabled software. And when you’re recording video with an iPhone, you can now quickly select AirPods as the main audio source. The earbuds can act as a lavalier microphone with voice pickup that’s closer to your mouth.</p>

<p>Even with all of the new features, Apple still managed to extend the AirPods Pro’s battery life. With ANC enabled, you can now expect up to eight hours of use on a charge — two hours longer than the AirPods Pro 2. This means you could be able to wear the new model for a full day of work without having to charge them. Additionally, Apple says that if you’re using transparency mode with the Hearing Aid feature, AirPods Pro 3 will last up to 10 hours.</p> 
<p>So far, I have no reason to think Apple has overstated battery life on the AirPods Pro 3. I haven’t conducted a straight battery rundown test yet as I’ve been focused on trying all of the new features at various times over the last few days. I will update this review later this week with the results of my battery test though.</p> 
<p>If you find the promised eight hours still isn’t enough, a five-minute rest in the case will be enough to give you an hour of use. That’s long enough to get you through a quick workout or a call when you need to keep things hands-free. There is an important caveat with the case though. Despite the extended use time on the earbuds themselves, the total battery life including the case is reduced to 24 hours from the previous 30. There’s also a new ultra wideband chip (U2) in the charging case that Apple says has increased the distance for Precision Find My by one and a half times compared to the previous version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-competition">The competition</h2> 
<p>Since <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">the “regular” AirPods</a> now offer ANC, Apple’s primary competition for the AirPods Pro 3 comes from within its own product lineup. The AirPods 4 with ANC offer an open-type fit even though they have impressive noise-blocking abilities, so they may be more comfortable for those who don’t like buds sticking into their ear canals. You’ll get Live Translation there too, but you won’t be able to access heart-rate tracking and Apple’s suite of hearing health tools. That might not matter to those who want to save some money though, as the AirPods 4 with ANC are $179 versus $249 for the AirPods Pro 3.</p> 
<p>All AirPods are really a conduit for Apple’s ecosystem, so if you don’t mind missing some iPhone integrations and special features, there are worthwhile alternatives. <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM5</a> remains a jack of all trades, offering a set of features that perhaps only Apple can rival.

The sum of the company’s upgrades here are more significant than the choice to finally bring ANC to the “regular” AirPods last year. The combination of more precise ANC, improved sound quality, heart-rate tracking, Live Translation and longer battery life is a lot to explore. And that’s not even counting the redesign and new ear tips that offer a more secure fit, two items that directly address one of the main criticisms of previous AirPods models.</p> 
<p>If recent history is any indication, the company will continue to add new features to this third-generation version. I highly doubt that Apple is finished exploiting the power of the H2 chip, so it's just getting started with what the AirPods Pro 3 can do.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c87b81dd-4c28-44d2-b00a-481abbeda6a2" />

"When I was a kid I bought a used bowling trophy."&nbsp;</p>

However, HBO Max's medical drama <em>The Pitt</em> surprisingly pipped <em>Severance</em> for the Best Outstanding Drama Series, while also earning Noah Wyle and Katherine LaNasa drama series awards for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actress, respectively. HBO Max also scooped awards for its comedy series <em>Hacks</em> with Jean Smart taking the Outstanding Lead Actress trophy and Hannah Einbinder winning for Outstanding Supporting Actress.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix took the prize for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series with critical darling <em>Adolescence</em>, with that same show earning Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty Emmys for lead actor and supporting actor and actress, respectively (at 15, Cooper is the youngest-ever male winner of a Primetime acting Emmy). That show also won Emmys for outstanding directing and writing for a limited or anthology series or movie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Emmys showed again how prestige and money continue to shift from networks to streamers. CBS's only Emmy was for <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, a show it canceled in August. NBC won for the <em>Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special</em>, while cabler HBO took prizes for <em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em> (Outstanding Scripted Variety Series and Outstanding Writing) along with <em>The Penguin</em> (Cristin Milioti for Outstanding Lead Actress) and <em>Somebody Somewhere</em> (Jeff Hiller for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series).&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-won-big-at-the-primetime-emmys-with-severance-and-the-studio-093051329.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p></p> 
<p>No pun intended, but what I like about <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Quicken;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Quicken&amp;linkText=Quicken+Simplifi&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAay1xJNTnjYldw5nF1qz8tSfhiJSkTuaz3OiZWyrTB-K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fquicken.com%2Flp%2Fppc%2Fsimplifi-vs-mint%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://quicken.com/lp/ppc/simplifi-vs-mint/">Quicken Simplifi</a> is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Another one of the key features I appreciate is the ability to set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch).</p> 
<p>Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there's a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.</p>

<p>In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase.</p> 
<p>The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average.</p> 
<p>Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.”</p>

My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it's more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it.</p> 
<p>Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You'll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.</p>

<p>Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=introduced&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9yZXBvcnRzLWNhbmFkYS1pbXByb3ZlZC1zeW5jaW5nIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3JlcG9ydHMtY2FuYWRhLWltcHJvdmVkLXN5bmNpbmcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeK62o1SLpdRxDJdlcN8USUe_xrXlKuyGd4uvsYmoaYy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Freports-canada-improved-syncing" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/reports-canada-improved-syncing">introduced</a> a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph.</p> 
<p>The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+expanded+on+the+net+worth+graph&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9uZXctbmV0LXdvcnRoLWNoYXJ0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWFuZC1tb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L25ldy1uZXQtd29ydGgtY2hhcnQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtYW5kLW1vcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVv90h2WMw7_4yXuvFvGDLlzhRQRUn1jj223BWdeKJX5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fnew-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/new-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more">Monarch expanded on the net worth graph</a>, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time.</p> 
<p>On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.mx.com/">MX</a> and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://help.simplifimoney.com/en/articles/8545901-how-to-import-transactions-from-mint">has a Chrome extension</a> for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data.</p> 
<p>Additionally, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9zeW5jLXlvdXItYXBwbGUtY2FyZC1hcHBsZS1jYXNoLWFuZC1zYXZpbmdzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3N5bmMteW91ci1hcHBsZS1jYXJkLWFwcGxlLWNhc2gtYW5kLXNhdmluZ3MifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX0braGlEY1h2EHzEVeCqtzANy-Xa-2RelG8k1e75rFW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fsync-your-apple-card-apple-cash-and-savings" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/sync-your-apple-card-apple-cash-and-savings">Monarch</a> just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It's not the only one either; currently, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/copilotmoney/status/1765099126595764288">Copilot</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:YNAB;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b2df7bfa-ff43-44ef-a78c-6e045229e2f8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YNAB&amp;linkText=YNAB&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55bmFiLmNvbS9ibG9nL3luYWItYXBwbGUtd2FsbGV0PyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55bmFiLmNvbS9ibG9nL3luYWItYXBwbGUtd2FsbGV0PyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb0hLCO0fajT5k7FD62mlqPyFHmvI2Sjsi-tsuMQzQ2N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ynab.com%2Fblog%2Fynab-apple-wallet%3F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.ynab.com/blog/ynab-apple-wallet?">YNAB</a> have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month.</p> 
<p>Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn't provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://copilot.money/">Copilot Money</a> might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there.</p>

<p>There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses.</p> 
<p>Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing.</p>

<p>Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="mailto:venmo@venmo.com">venmo@venmo.com</a> are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app.</p> 
<p>While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits.</p> 
<p>Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well.</p> 
<p>Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://intelligence.copilot.money/">its website</a>, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year.</p> 
<p>Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark.</p> 
<p> <core-commerce id="39236874c65c492bb3682eddbfa1c0a2" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.nerdwallet.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You may know <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a> as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too.</p> 
<p>Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA).</p>

<p>As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you'll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though.</p> 
<p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says.</p> 
<p>Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring.</p> 
<p>Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay).</p>

A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you.</p> 
<p>Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting.</p> 
<p>The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week).</p> 
<p>My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-how-ynab-gives-me-peace-of-mind-and-keeps-my-money-in-check-140049410.html">penned a respectful rebuttal</a>, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-mint-alternatives-we-tested">Other Mint alternatives we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> 
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p>

<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-import-your-financial-data-from-the-mint-app">How to import your financial data from the Mint app</h2> 
<p>Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data.</p> 
<p>To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><p>Sign into Mint.com and hit <strong>Transactions</strong> in the menu on the left side of the screen.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Select an account, or <strong>all accounts</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Scroll down and look for “<strong>export [number] transactions</strong>” in smaller print.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Your CSV file should begin downloading.</p></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-mint-alternatives">How we tested Mint alternatives</h2> 
<p>Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a> myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-a-midrange-phone">What is a midrange phone?</h2> 
<p>While the term frequently appears in articles and videos, there isn’t an agreed-upon definition for “midrange” beyond a phone that isn’t a flagship or an entry-level option. Most of our recommendations cost between $400 and $600 — any less and you should expect significant compromises. If you have more to spend, you might as well consider flagships like the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html">Apple iPhone 17</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-170040665.html">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> if you want the best smartphone experience. Devices like Pixel phones often sit in this price range too, offering some of the best value for Android buyers.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-midrange-smartphone">What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone</h2> 
<p>Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it’s great.) And if you’re an Android fan, there’s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn’t rule either out.</p> 
<p>Of course, also consider how much you’re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Moreover, manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer with software updates and security updates, so it’s worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras with high megapixel counts? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what’s important to you will make choosing one easier.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-wont-you-get-from-a-midrange-smartphone">What <em>won’t</em> you get from a midrange smartphone?</h2> 
<p>Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones blurs as more upmarket features and functions trickle down to more affordable models. When Engadget first published this guide in 2020, it was tricky to find a $500 phone with waterproofing and 5G. In 2025, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging – and even then, that’s becoming less true.</p> 
<p>One thing your new phone probably won’t come with is a power adapter; many companies have stopped including chargers with all of their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their camera systems have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600 with decent camera quality, selfie performance and software support to keep things running smoothly for years to come..</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-midrange-smartphone-faqs">Midrange smartphone FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-midrange-phones-get-software-updates">How long do midrange phones get software updates?</h3> 
<p>Support varies by brand, but most midrange phones receive around three to five years of software and security updates. Apple tends to support iPhones longer while companies like Google and Samsung now promise several years of Android and security patches for their midrange models. Budget-focused brands might offer less so it’s worth checking the update policy before you buy.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-midrange-phones-good-for-gaming">Are midrange phones good for gaming?</h3> 
<p>Yes, many midrange phones handle gaming well, especially popular titles like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>. They usually include capable processors, though you won’t always get the smoothest performance in the most demanding mobile games or at max settings. If you play casually or stick to less graphically intensive titles a midrange phone will feel more than adequate.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another adorable game that I&#39;ve become completely obsessed with. I came across <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://miaumigames.itch.io/roly-pony"><em>Roly-Pony</em></a> this weekend during a particularly soul-sucking bout of doomscrolling, and it&#39;s turned out to be the perfect little temporary respite from <em>the horrors</em>. (Shoutout to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malicedafirenze.bsky.social/post/3lymxnpo5ps2g">Alice Ruppert</a> of <em>The Mane Quest</em> for always keeping us informed about the latest in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-developers-are-trying-to-make-horse-games-that-dont-suck-its-not-easy-140008337.html">horse games</a>).</p>
<p><em>Roly-Pony</em> is a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://youtu.be/eh_xSyPsEVI?t=191"><em>Suika</em></a>-style game, meaning it involves dropping and stacking round objects in order to create matching pairs that combine to become different, bigger objects. That&#39;ll also clear up space on the board in the process, which is important because, similar to <em>Tetris</em>, you can&#39;t allow the objects to pile too high. In this case, you start with horse treats and keep building on them until you&#39;ve unlocked a bunch of different horses. It&#39;s very simple and <em>very</em> cute, with peaceful music going in the background and a lot of little details that people who love horses will really appreciate.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game is free and playable on both the web and mobile, with a leaderboard so you can see how you rank. I naively thought I would just quickly check this game out (because, horses) and move on after a few minutes, but have instead spent <em>hours</em> this weekend trying to crack the top 10. I&#39;ve now got it bookmarked on both my laptop and my phone, so at this point there&#39;s no end in sight. <em>Roly-Pony</em> is free, but there&#39;s an option to send a few dollars the developers&#39; way on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> if you want to support their work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-horse-themed-browser-puzzle-game-is-an-absolute-delight-and-i-cant-stop-playing-it-214313395.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign is continuing to gain momentum after hitting more than <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-has-hit-a-major-milestone-but-the-fights-just-begun-190431644.html">a million signatures</a> in July. After a July 31st deadline, the movement secured around 1.45 million signatures, which the organizers are currently in the process of verifying. The initiative aims to enact legislation that preserves access to video games, even when developers decide to end support, as seen with Ubisoft when it delisted <em>The Crew</em> and revoked access to players who already purchased the game. There were some early concerns about the potential for falsely-submitted signatures, but the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">latest update</a> from organizers said that early reports show around 97 percent of the signatures are valid.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works_en">European Commission&#39;s website</a>, EU authorities have three months to verify the signatures once they are submitted. After that, the organizers said they will personally deliver the petition to the European Commission. With initial estimates clearing the threshold of one million verified signatures, the following steps involve getting meetings with both the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>From the date of the initiative&#39;s submission, the European Union will get six months to decide what to do regarding the Stop Killing Games movement. There is the possibility of the governing bodies not taking any action at all, but the organizers said they are &quot;preparing to ensure our initiative cannot be ignored.&quot; To prepare for the meetings, the organizers said they will be reaching out to members of Parliament and the Commission, while also trying to counter any misinformation or industry lobbying. For now, the campaign will post more frequent updates on its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://discord.gg/TCE6uXwsBe">Discord community</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/">social media channels</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It&#39;s been quite the wait, but the fourth season of <em>The Witcher</em> is almost here. In a teaser shared this weekend, Netflix finally revealed the release date: October 30. The video also provided an extended look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia — a casting change that fans naturally have <em>a lot</em> of feelings about after Henry Cavill won their hearts with his take on the character in the first three seasons. The minute-and-a-half-long clip doesn&#39;t give away too much about season four, but we now have a proper sense of what our new Geralt looks and sounds like.</p>
<p>This season will also see Laurence Fishburne join as Regis, Sharlto Copley as Leo Bonhart and James Purefoy as Skellen. It&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stop-tossing-coins-to-the-witcher-after-season-five-171500284.html"><ins>the second to last season of the Netflix adaptation</ins></a>, and the streaming company has said that the two final seasons will cover the last three books in the series: <em>Baptism of Fire</em>, <em>The Tower of the Swallow</em> and<em> Lady of the Lake</em>. But, fans still have more Witcher content to look forward to yet outside of the show. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-sees-ciri-kicking-butt-014137326.html"><em><ins>The Witcher 4</ins></em></a> (the game) is on the way, though we don&#39;t yet have a release date.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fortunately for Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 owners, the FOMO from Apple&#39;s announcement of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html">AirPods Pro 3</a> last week was short-lived. After introducing the latest Beats ear hook style headphones in February, Apple is introducing new features and updating the heart rate tracking functionality of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/a-beats-headphone-sale-includes-all-time-lows-on-the-solo-4-and-powerbeats-pro-2-144550967.html">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> with the upcoming release of iOS 26.</p>
<p>With the latest iOS upgrade, Powerbeats Pro 2 integrates better with Apple&#39;s Fitness app, giving users more accurate data and the choice of up to 50 different workout types. For Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Fitness+</a> users, the Beats earbuds will also show the heart rate, calories burned and &quot;Burn Bar&quot; metrics in real time. Outside the Fitness app, iOS 26 will bring smaller improvements like being able to use a single earbud for heart rate monitoring, better accuracy when counting steps even when your iPhone isn&#39;t on you and a new algorithm that churns out faster heart rate readings. To make your life easier, the updated Powerbeats Pro 2 will send you a notification to get a better fit for more accurate heart rate monitoring and can sense if you nod or shake your head in response to Siri asking you to answer an incoming call or hear a text.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of these iOS 26 upgrades for the Powerbeats Pro 2 will mostly put it in line with the AirPods Pro 3 features when the update releases on September 15. However, in our review of the Beats earbuds, we found that they offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">mediocre ANC performance</a>. It&#39;s worth noting that Android users for the Powerbeats Pro 2 won&#39;t get many of the Apple-branded features that come with iOS 26.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/some-much-needed-upgrades-are-coming-to-powerbeats-pro-2-with-ios-26-181716994.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-trick-googles-ai-overviews-into-explaining-made-up-idioms-162816472.html">AI Overviews</a> were introduced with a comically <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://theconversation.com/eat-a-rock-a-day-put-glue-on-your-pizza-how-googles-ai-is-losing-touch-with-reality-230953">rocky start</a>, it&#39;s about to face a far more serious challenge. Penske Media, the publisher for <em>Rolling Stone, Variety, Billboard </em>and others, filed a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://chatgptiseatingtheworld.com/2025/09/14/penske-media-v-google-complaint-rolling-stone-owner-sues-google-for-ai-mode-antitrust-claim/">lawsuit</a> against Google, claiming the tech giant illegally powers its AI Overviews feature with content from its sites. Penske claimed in the lawsuit that the AI feature is also &quot;siphoning and discouraging user traffic to PMC&#39;s and other publishers&#39; websites,&quot; adding that &quot;the revenue generated by those visits will decline.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC&#39;s federal district court, claims that about 20 percent of Google searches that link to one of Penske&#39;s sites now have AI Overviews. The media company argued that this percentage will continue to increase and that its affiliate revenue through 2024 dropped by more than a third from its peak. Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said that the tech giant will &quot;defend against these meritless claims&quot; and that &quot;AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this year, Google faced a similar lawsuit from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/educational-tech-company-chegg-sues-google-over-ai-overviews-133017759.html">Chegg</a>, an educational tech company that&#39;s known for textbook rentals. Like Penske Media, this lawsuit alleged that Google&#39;s AI Overviews hurt website traffic and revenue for Chegg. However, the Penske lawsuit is the first time that Google has faced legal action from a major US publisher about its AI search capabilities.</p>
<p>Beyond Google&#39;s legal troubles, other AI companies have also been facing their own court cases. In 2023, the New York Times <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-york-times-is-suing-openai-and-microsoft-for-copyright-infringement-181212615.html">sued OpenAI</a>, claiming the AI company used published news articles to train its chatbots without offering compensation. More recently, Anthropic agreed to pay a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-will-pay-a-record-breaking-15-billion-to-settle-copyright-lawsuit-with-authors-192800292.html">$1.5 billion settlement</a> in a class action lawsuit targeting its Claude chatbot&#39;s use of copyrighted works.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-faces-its-first-ai-overviews-lawsuit-from-a-major-us-publisher-162333462.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A California bill that would require operating system and app store providers to verify users&#39; ages before they can download apps has cleared the Assembly 58-0, and will now move on to Gov. Gavin Newsom, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/13/california-advances-effort-to-check-kids-ages-online-amid-safety-concerns-00563005"><em><ins>Politico</ins></em></a> reports. The Digital Age Assurance Act (AB 1043), introduced by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, does not require photo identification for verification, but puts the onus on the platforms to provide tools for parents to indicate the user&#39;s age during a device&#39;s setup, and use this information steer kids toward age-appropriate content and screen time.</p>
<p>It comes after <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/utah-just-became-the-first-state-in-the-country-to-pass-an-age-verification-law-for-app-stores-225846117.html"><ins>Utah</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-enacts-age-verification-law-for-app-stores-190603522.html"><ins>Texas</ins></a> both adopted app store age verification laws earlier this year that have been criticized as posing potential privacy risks, and faced opposition from the likes of Google and Apple. The California bill has been received more positively by Big Tech, with Google, Meta and others putting out <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://a14.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250909-google-meta-among-tech-leaders-and-child-advocates-voicing-support-wicks"><ins>statements</ins></a> in support of it in the leadup to a Senate vote on Friday. Kareem Ghanem, Google&#39;s Senior Director of Government Affairs &amp; Public Policy, called the bill &quot;one of the most thoughtful approaches we’ve seen thus far to the challenges of keeping kids safe, recognizing that it’s a shared responsibility across the ecosystem.” Gov. Newsom now has until October 13 to sign or veto the bill, according to <em>Politico</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following her son&#39;s suicide, Becca Dallas filed a potentially groundbreaking lawsuit against <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-is-adding-an-age-estimation-feature-for-teens-110047092.html">Roblox</a> and Discord, accusing the platforms of wrongful death. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/technology/roblox-lawsuit-child-safety.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the lawsuit recounts the events leading up to Ethan Dallas&#39; death, detailing his interactions with a player named Nate. According to the report, Nate was likely a 37-year-old man named Timothy O&#39;Connor, who was previously arrested on charges of &quot;possessing child pornography and transmitting harmful material to minors.&quot; The report added that Ethan opened up about these incidents to his mom before committing suicide four months after the confession.</p>
<p>The lawsuit could be the first of its kind against Roblox, according to <em>NYTimes</em>, considering it attributes some blame to the gaming platform that&#39;s home to tens of millions of underaged players. In a statement responding to the report, a Roblox spokesperson said that child safety issues are seen across the industry and that the company was working on new safety features, while also complying with law enforcement.</p>

It&#39;s hard not to compare the Kodak Charmera to the ubiquitous Labubu craze, considering the highly collectible nature of Reto Pro selling these officially licensed mini cameras as a single blind box for $29.99 or a full set of six for $179.94. The keyring cameras, which only weigh 30 grams, are already sold out on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kodak.retopro.co/products/kodak-charmera-br-keychain-digital-camera-blind-box">Reto Pro website</a>, but are expected to be restocked.</p>
<p>The blind box can be unwrapped for one of seven designs, including one secret version that has a transparent shell to show off the tiny camera&#39;s internals. According to the website, the basic style odds are one out of six, while the secret edition has a probability of one out of 48. Whichever design you get, each Charmera comes with a keyring to Labubu-bify it to your belt loop or bag and a USB-C cable to export your photos or videos to other devices.</p>

Nobody should expect any ultrasharp images, but you can customize your shots with Kodak frames, vintage filters and a date stamp.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rear-wheel drive trim of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-fifth-cybertruck-recall-is-due-to-a-rear-view-camera-glitch-214029747.html">Tesla Cybertruck</a> lasted about five months before it was unceremoniously removed from online sales. The Long Range model represented the most affordable Cybertruck option with its starting price of $69,990, but visitors to Tesla&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#overview">online configurator</a> can now only choose between the all-wheel drive model that starts at $79,990 and the Cyberbeast trim, which goes for at least $114,990.</p>
<p>Tesla launched the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-70000-rwd-cybertruck-arrives-with-some-key-features-removed-120044840.html">Long Range version</a> of the Cybertruck in April, which arrived at $10,000 more than originally expected. Along with an elevated price tag, Tesla removed several features, including the power tonneau cover, adaptive suspension, a touchscreen for the back row, the rear lightbar and outlets in the truck bed. The RWD version also came with less towing power, a lower payload capacity and only one motor. While unrelated, the federal tax credit for EV buyers in the US is coming to a close at the end of the month, making the purchase of a Long Range model even less of a bargain.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla didn&#39;t officially offer any explanation about the removal of the Long Range option from its website, but it could be attributed to low Cybertruck sales overall. According to a report from <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2025-ev-sales/">Cox Automotive</a>, the parent company of Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, Tesla only sold 4,306 Cybertrucks in the second quarter of the year, which is a more than 50 percent drop in sales during the same time period last year.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-can-automatically-let-a-trusted-friend-know-you-got-home-safe-130010806.html">Snapchat</a> has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/infiniteretentionandgroupstreaks">introduced</a> a couple of new features it says are &quot;highly requested&quot; by its users. The first is &quot;Infinite Retention,&quot; which as its name implies will allow you to keep a chat history like you could on a messaging app and prevent your messages from disappearing. &quot;We’ve often heard from our community that Snapchatters want to save their chats forever and wish they could build streaks with their favorite groups,&quot; its announcement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app has been testing the feature <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/infinite-retention-mode">since 2024</a>, and now it&#39;s being rolled out broadly. You could already save messages in the app by tapping on them inside the chat, but this one makes things easier. It&#39;s a setting you&#39;ll just have to switch on or off for each conversation. If you enable the setting, the other person in the conversation will get a notification that you did, and they will be able to switch it off if they want. You can, for instance, switch Infinite Retention on for a close friend but keep it off for acquaintances.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Snapchat is rolling out Group Streaks that will let you contribute to a collective Streak with your friends. To keep up individual Streaks, you&#39;ll have to send and receive at least one photo or video Snap with a friend every day. Group Streaks are easier to keep going, since several people can participate. You can also restore a Group Streak within a week in case it ends.&nbsp;</p>

These earbuds remain our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html">best budget wireless earbuds</a>.</p> 
<p>The most significant feature on the A40 earbuds is the inclusion of active noise cancellation (ANC), which is almost unheard of at this price point. It's not the most sophisticated ANC, but it does sufficiently reduce constant rumbling background noise like on a plane. The built-in mic that's used for transparency mode and phone calls is a bit subpar, especially when used in noisy areas.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p> <core-commerce id="fc90f51482e440699fabd2aa552d889e" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Auto-Adjustable-Cancelling-Wireless-Headphone/dp/B0B1LVC5VZ?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>These are budget-friendly, so while they can't be expected to compete on audio quality with flagship headphones that cost hundreds of dollars, the sound is still impressive given their low cost. The sound profile is warm, with a strong upper-bass, while some of the higher frequencies lose finer details. For those wanting to fine-tune the sound on the A40s, the earbuds can be paired with the Soundcore app, which includes an EQ.</p> 
<p>The small, round earpieces help make the A40s comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the charging case extends the already solid 10-hour battery life by another 50 or so hours. The Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds are already one of the best value options on the market, and this sale makes them even more appealing.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-white-house-reportedly-ordered-xais-grok-to-be-approved-for-government-use-165625891.html">xAI</a> has laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team, the company&#39;s largest, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-layoffs-data-annotators-2025-9"><em>Business Insider</em></a>. The annotation team is in charge of categorizing and contextualizing raw data used to train Grok so that it can understand the world better. <em>Business Insider </em>says the laid off employees were informed via email on the evening of September 12, Friday, that it was going to downsize its team of general AI tutors. They were reportedly told that they would be paid their salaries until the end of their contracts on November 30, but their access to xAI&#39;s systems had been cut off after they received the notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-xai-lays-off-hundreds-data-annotators-business-insider-reports-2025-09-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a> asked the company for a comment, it referred to a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/xai/status/1966677385056841884">post on X</a> wherein it posted a call for specialist AI tutors instead. xAI said that it will &quot;immediately surge [its] Specialist AI tutor team by 10x&quot; and that it&#39;s hiring across STEM fields. As specialist tutors, the new hires will be &quot;enhancing [the company&#39;s] AI technologies through high-quality inputs, labels and annotations using specialized software.&quot; They&#39;ll gather data and provide their own, not only in text format, but also through audio recordings and video sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>Reuters</em> has noted, the layoffs come after several high-profile departures from xAI, including the company&#39;s chief financial officer Mike Liberatore. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-must-spent-almost-an-hour-talking-about-grok-without-mentioning-its-nazi-problem-061101656.html">launched Grok 4</a> in July, calling it the &quot;smartest AI in the world.&quot; Elon Musk claimed during the model&#39;s reveal that if you make Grok 4 take the SATs and the GREs, it would get near perfect results every time and can answer questions it&#39;s never seen before. He also proclaimed that Grok is going to invent new tech maybe later this year, and that he would be shocked if it doesn&#39;t happen next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/xai-reportedly-laid-off-at-least-500-ai-tutors-working-on-grok-130059624.html?src=rss]]></description>
