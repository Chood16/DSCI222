<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are no small upgrade from the previous generation. ANC is twice as effective as that of the AirPods Pro 2, thanks to a combination of ultra-low noise microphones, computational audio and new foam-infused ear tips, which make for both a better fit and improved noise isolation, according to Engadget's Billy Steele, who spent some <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-closer-look-at-the-airpods-pro-3-anc-live-translation-and-heart-rate-tracking-193956229.html">hands-on time with the earbuds</a>. The Live Translation feature fared well when tested on Spanish-to-English and French-to-English translations, making the earbuds a potentially handy tool to have for travel. (You'll need an iPhone with Apple Intelligence in order to use Live Translation, though).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The earbuds earned a score of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">90 in Engadget's review</a>, which notes noticeable improvements in sound quality and battery life. Apple says you'll get up to eight hours on a charge with ANC enabled. With the addition of heart-rate monitoring and support for 50 workouts using Apple's Fitness app, the AirPods Pro 3 allow you to get heart rate metrics during exercise without wearing an Apple Watch.</p> 
<p>There's a lot to like about the latest version of the AirPods Pro, so discount or not, you can't go wrong if you've been holding out for a meaningful upgrade. Per our review, "The AirPods Pro 3 is the biggest update to Apple’s earbuds lineup in years."</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said a TikTok deal is expected to be signed &quot;in the coming days,&quot; after President Donald Trump posted an update on Friday that did little to clarify where the deal currently stands following a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump said both that the two had &quot;made progress&quot; on &quot;approval of the TikTok Deal&quot; and that he &quot;appreciate[s] the TikTok approval.&quot; Trump also told reporters in the Oval Office that &quot;he approved the TikTok deal,&quot; <em>Reuters</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-xi-seek-tiktok-win-break-us-china-gridlock-2025-09-19/">reported</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But Chinese state-run media reported the call a bit differently, according to <em>The New York Times</em>, saying that Xi conveyed that the government &quot;respects the wishes of the company in question and is glad to see business negotiations in line with market rules and a solution that conforms to Chinese laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides.”</p>
<p>TikTok owner ByteDance did little to clear things up when it issued the following <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/september-19?lang=en">statement</a>. &quot;We thank President Xi Jinping and President Donald J. Trump for their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States. ByteDance will work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>During an appearance on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379847651112"><em><ins>Fox News</ins></em></a>&#39; &quot;Saturday in America&quot; the following day, Leavitt added a bit more detail to the announcement, after first saying, &quot;We are 100 percent confident that a deal is done. Now that deal just needs to be signed, and the president&#39;s team is working with their Chinese counterparts to do just that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This deal means that TikTok will be majority owned by Americans in the United States,&quot; Leavitt said. &quot;There will be seven seats on the board that controls the app in the United States and six of those seats will be Americans.&quot; According to Leavitt, data and privacy will be led by Oracle, &quot;and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well.&quot;</p>
<p>She went on to say that &quot;all of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed, and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days.&quot;</p>
<p>This week, there have been multiple reports that the two sides were reaching the final stages of negotiations.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to a report by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/20/epa-scientists-research-publications/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, scientists with the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Office of Water were ordered by &quot;political appointees&quot; to stop work on studies that were headed for publication, as they&#39;ll now be &quot;subject to a new review process.&quot; Staffers were reportedly given the instructions in a town hall meeting this week. The only papers exempt are those for which &quot;scientific journals had already returned proofs — the final step in the academic publication process,&quot; reports <em>The Washington Post</em>, which spoke to two agency employees. Among other things, the role of the Office of Water is to ensure the safety of drinking water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the latest in a string of changes at the EPA under the Trump administration, and raises yet more concerns for public health. In May, the agency announced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/the-epa-is-rolling-back-biden-era-clean-water-rules-130029921.html">plans to roll back limitations</a> for some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as &quot;forever chemicals,&quot; that had been set by the Biden administration, saying it would keep only the limits for the two most common, PFOA and PFOS. In July, the EPA <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-epa-cutting-workforce-by-23-closing-research-division-2025-07-18/">laid off thousands of employees</a> and announced it would shut down its scientific research office. The same month, the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way">EPA proposed</a> rescinding certain greenhouse gas emissions standards, and just last week <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-end-burdensome-costly-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program-saving-24">announced a plan</a> to do away with the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program that requires some of the nation&#39;s biggest polluters to report their emissions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the latest orders, staffers with the Office of Water who spoke to <em>The Washington Post</em> said they were not given a reason to provide scientific journals as to why the papers have been halted, and no details on the new review process have been shared. One employee told the publication, &quot;This represents millions of dollars of research, potentially, that’s now being stopped.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/epa-scientists-were-reportedly-ordered-to-halt-publication-of-research-papers-183751436.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the joy of exploring the underwater world in <em>Subnautica</em>, diving deeper into the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subnautica-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-2026-amid-developer-drama-123042406.html"><em>Subnautica 2</em> lawsuit</a> is the furthest thing from rewarding. The latest update in the convoluted lawsuit between <em>Subnautica</em>&#39;s developer, Unknown Worlds, and its parent company, Krafton, represents a complete 180 with one of the case&#39;s key claims. According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> report, Krafton said that &quot;documents relating to the readiness of the game were irrelevant to the termination&quot; of Unknown Worlds&#39; leadership, which was one of the main disagreements that led to the legal action in the first place.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, <em>Subnautica 2</em>&#39;s developers felt the game was ready for early access, while Krafton claimed otherwise and instead delayed it to 2026. The lawsuit hinged on this major dispute and included <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-subnautica-2-212928022.html">many crucial elements</a>, like a $250 million performance bonus and the leadership team being fired and replaced. This change of heart from Krafton has left Fortis Advisors, who represent the founders of Unknown Worlds, confused and called this &quot;a seismic shift in the case,&quot; according to <em>PC Gamer</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Krafton reps didn&#39;t offer clear reasoning as to why they&#39;re not pursuing this argument anymore, but instead want to focus on making the case that Unknown Worlds&#39; leadership &quot;abandoned their post&quot; and &quot;deceived&quot; Krafton, according to the report. To further complicate things, Fortis claimed that Krafton isn&#39;t cooperating with providing evidence for the lawsuit. As the case moves through the discovery phase, where both sides try to obtain evidence from the other, it&#39;s obvious that thalassophiles will have to wait a little longer for the hotly anticipated sequel.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-complicated-subnautica-2-lawsuit-just-took-a-bizarre-twist-175829731.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From a disastrous AMA on Monday to disappointing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-hands-on-powerful-upgrades-but-with-an-even-higher-price-060052114.html">Legion Go 2</a> preorder customers on Friday, the Lenovo team is having a hell of a week. To kick things off, the Lenovo Legion team hosted an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/were_the_lenovo_legion_team_ask_us_anything_about/">AMA on Reddit</a> revolving around its gaming handheld launch. The Legion Go 2 generated a ton of hype, being Lenovo&#39;s next-gen gaming handheld with more powerful specs and a higher price tag, but the team only answered 10 questions before abandoning the thread. On Wednesday, Lenovo apologized for not being prepared enough to answer all the questions, but followed it up with a bombshell in an edit posted on Friday, adding that &quot;we will need to cancel some preorders placed directly on Lenovo.com&quot; for the Legion Go 2.</p>
<p>According to the Lenovo team, the demand &quot;substantially exceeded our projections&quot; and led to &quot;unforeseen delivery range extensions.&quot; While the orders with Lenovo&#39;s retail partners, like Best Buy, aren&#39;t affected, anyone who preordered the Legion Go 2 directly on the Lenovo website may see some frustrating news in their inboxes. The cancellations might not be a total shocker, since some <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1niilj2/canceled_my_legion_go_2_preorder_disappointed_by/">user reports</a> are circulating that Lenovo already pushed initial ship dates from September to October with &quot;zero communication about the delay.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To try to save face, Lenovo explained that &quot;as soon as our inventory is replenished, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/coming-soon/coming_soon_laptops/legion-go-gen-2/len106g0004">Lenovo.com</a> will show updated availability and ordering will reopen.&quot; There&#39;s no indication yet if those with canceled orders will get priority with the next batch of available devices, but the Lenovo team said it would respond to the AMA thread&#39;s questions over the rest of the month. However, if Reddit comments are any indication, there&#39;s a good chance a lot of customers won&#39;t reorder following this catastrophic launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lenovo-abruptly-cancels-some-legion-go-2-preorders-due-to-overwhelming-demand-161250775.html?src=rss]]></description>

New subscribers can get three free months of that plan — which, at $17 per month normally, comes out to $51 in savings for the whole period.</p> 
<p>The Family Plan allows six different users to access the platform. It offers cross-device support and each user is tied to an Apple ID, so their favorite music won't mess with anyone else's algorithm.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Apple Music actually topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html">best music streaming platforms</a>, and for good reason. It sounds great and it's easy to use. What else is there? All music is available in CD quality or higher and there are plenty of personalized playlists and the like. The platform also operates a number of live radio stations, which is fun.</p> 
<p>The service is available for Android devices, but it really shines on Apple products. To that end, the web and Windows PC apps aren’t as polished as the iOS version. It doesn't <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2025/01/streaming-payouts-hit-new-low-artists-earn/">pay artists properly</a>, but that's true of every music streaming platform. Apple Music does pay out more than Spotify, but that's an incredibly low bar.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of the year’s biggest blockbuster games have just dropped or are coming very soon. But among the likes of<em> Borderlands 4, EA Sports FC 26 </em>and <em>Battlefield 6</em>, there are a ton of neat indie games popping up. We’re here to tell you about some of &#39;em and what else is going on in the space with our weekly indie games roundup.</p>
<p>There were showcases this week from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1XPDO4fdU">Critical Reflex</a> (which was packed with neat oddities), <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdR1mv_GGPw">Game Devs of Color</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=15a8fa5e-1be5-4bd4-8da7-4a779332b99a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Six+One+Indie&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vYml0Lmx5L3NpeG9uZWZhbGwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE1YThmYTVlLTFiZTUtNGJkNC04ZGE3LTRhNzc5MzMyYjk5YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS9zaXhvbmVmYWxsIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASsfmjDHGXhf-Yi7Tf5Hn8UhdmNaP_nbeNPdgYGUZTxv&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fsixonefall" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="http://bit.ly/sixonefall">Six One Indie</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN6jff-wJ4w">Convergence</a>. There&#39;s far too much cool stuff in these for us to highlight everything — during the Six One Indie preshow alone, I added three games to my Steam wishlist. So, if you&#39;re into indie games and have the time, I recommend checking these streams out.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If all of that isn&#39;t enough for you, there&#39;s another indie showcase coming next Wednesday called <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@IndieFanFest">Indie Fan Fest</a> from The Mix and Digital Bandidos. That&#39;s not all: a Capcom stream is taking place on September 24 (not exactly indie, but <em>Pragmata </em>looks interesting) and rumors of a PlayStation event are ramping up ahead of Tokyo Game Show next week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on an <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io game jam</a> that&#39;s been running this past week. It&#39;s all about falling block games. I&#39;m really enjoying the updates that a developer named Wallaber is sharing on Bluesky for a project called <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/walaber.com/post/3lyytw6rgy22h"><em>Jelly Well</em></a>.</p>
<p>A quick note for any indie developers who are joining us before we check out some of this week&#39;s new releases: submissions for the December edition of Day of the Devs are open. Landing a spot in that showcase is one of the highest-profile spotlights an indie developer can get these days, so if you have a cool game to show off, <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.dayofthedevs.org/showcases/day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-digital-showcase-2025">shoot your shot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2>

<p>The team behind <em>Patapon</em> is back with a <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ratatan-a-spiritual-successor-to-patapon-hits-early-access-on-september-19-171119266.html">spiritual successor to that classic rhythm game series</a>. There are strategic and roguelike elements in <em>Ratatan</em>, which is from TVT Co. Ltd., Ratata Arts and publisher Game Source Entertainment. There&#39;s co-op for up to four players as well.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to match the beat of the soundtrack to defeat enemies, and battles can feature more than 100 characters. It all looks quite charming, though I can&#39;t help but think of that song by Babymetal and Electric Callboy whenever I read the game&#39;s title (the immensely catchy <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDnIEWyVIlE">&quot;Ratatata&quot;</a> is rarely far away from my thoughts anyway). <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/"><em>Ratatan</em></a> is out in early access on Steam for $25, but there&#39;s a 10 percent launch discount until September 28.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-voyagers-is-a-co-op-puzzle-game-from-the-studio-behind-builders-journey-222331161.html"><em>Lego Voyagers</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a lovely-looking co-op adventure from Light Brick Studio (<a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-builders-journey-pc-nintendo-switch-release-date-154656236.html"><em>Lego Builder&#39;s Journey</em></a>) and publisher Annapurna Interactive. It&#39;s out now on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/">Steam</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lego-voyagers-9b1851">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
<p>Here, you and a partner (there&#39;s local co-op and online support) will go on a journey to rescue an abandoned spaceship. Your lil&#39; bricks can snap together and combine with other Lego pieces to solve puzzles as you make your way through this land. It&#39;s said to be a fairly short game, clocking in at between three and five hours, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing given how much bloat there is in many games.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had my eye on <em>Henry Halfhead </em>— from Lululu Entertainment and co-publisher Popagenda — for a while and I&#39;m looking forward to checking out this sandbox adventure. You play as Henry, who is just the top half of a human head. You can transform into any nearby object and play around with things in the environment. A narrator will react to your escapades as you solve challenges and guide Henry through life. There&#39;s a co-op mode too.</p>
<p><em>Henry Halfhead </em>is available on <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058140/Henry_Halfhead/">Steam</a>, Switch and PS5. It typically costs $13, but there&#39;s a 25 percent launch discount until September 30.</p>

<p>11 Bit Studios&#39; <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>has now landed on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 after debuting on PC this time last year. It&#39;s a city-building survival sim that starts 30 years after a blizzard ravaged the planet and caused an eternal winter.</p>
<p>I dig the set up and aesthetic here. City builders in this vein aren&#39;t usually my kind of thing, but since <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>is on Game Pass, I might give it a try.</p>
<div id="b05a724ca5fa4e4faca194295d37c55f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvKzOe7IRro?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>Don’t Die, Collect Loot </em>hit early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052160/Dont_Die_Collect_Loot/">Steam</a> this week. This is a vertically scrolling <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque roguelite from solo developer Dan Marchand (aka Dan Makes Video Games) and indie.io.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve been looking for a new way to watch numbers go up and live out a power fantasy, this one might be of interest. For what it&#39;s worth, I love the chiptune music in the trailer. <em>Don’t Die, Collect Loot </em>costs $10 and there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until October 3.</p>
<div id="0b5eda0018a04208aeb44bb6b9664e50"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WTN739rLxV8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>A trailer for <em>Troleu</em> hooked me in during publisher Critical Reflex&#39;s showcase. At its essence, this is a trolleybus conductor simulator, but it looks like things will get very much out of hand. You&#39;ll get into fist fights with unruly passengers (who may include aliens) and punt them from the vehicle if necessary. There are multiple routes, leaderboards and even a T. rex. It all seems quite chaotic.</p>
<p><em>Troleu</em>, which was made by solo developer andrground, is out now on <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731330/TROLEU/">Steam</a>. You can get it for 20 percent off the regular price of $10 until September 29.</p>
<div id="00688914c91746ce95b8a0018d1cae9f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJlk74_E-YE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Speaking of aliens, here&#39;s a theme park (and zoo?) simulator with a difference: it&#39;s set in the universe of <em>Mars Attacks</em>. In <em>Mars Attracts</em>, you can abduct humans and experiment on the lowly primates for the entertainment of Martians, who come for the cruelty. The Convergence Games showcase featured a short look <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMJTJmMDdTI">at the early stages of the game</a> — experimenting on the loely specimens is your path to unlocking upgrades.</p>
<p>Outlier&#39;s <em>Mars Attracts </em>is in early access on <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2760580/Mars_Attracts/">Steam</a>. The $25 game has a 10 percent discount until September 22, and I might just pick it up.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming</h2>

<p><em>Relooted </em>was one of the more exciting games that <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rescue-african-artifacts-from-colonizers-museums-in-the-heist-game-relooted-000035161.html">caught our attention</a> during Summer Game Fest. South African developer Nyamakop is creating a heist game that sees your crew setting out to reclaim plundered African artifacts from the hands of private collectors. It&#39;s a terrific setup, and you can now find out how the game actually plays thanks to a demo that dropped this week on <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3972400/Relooted_Demo/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll get to play through the tutorial and one mission while getting a sense of the game&#39;s story. Before you grab any of the valuable artifacts, you&#39;ll need to spend a little time planning your escape from a given area with the help of your crew. You can replay the mission to try different options and routes.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the demo quite a bit. The movement is slick (it reminds me a bit of <em>Aerial_Knight&#39;s Never Yield</em>) and the light strategy and puzzle solving sits just right for me. There&#39;s no release date for <em>Relooted </em>as yet, but I&#39;ll absolutely be playing it. The game is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/">Steam</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/relooted-89fdd7">Epic Games Store</a> and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p><em>Dispatch </em>is a game <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dispatch-is-a-new-narrative-game-from-ex-telltale-developers-133031972.html">we&#39;ve covered</a> a <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="http://n/">few times</a>, and now it has a release date. This is a superhero workplace comedy from AdHoc Studio, a team of former Telltale developers. It&#39;s about a sidelined hero who becomes a superhero dispatcher.</p>
<p>The animation and art look sumptuous, and there&#39;s an outstanding cast that includes Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey, Matthew Mercer and Jeffrey Wright. <em>Dispatch</em> is coming your way on October 22 on <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Steam</a> (where you can check out a demo) and PS5.</p>

<p><em>Jupiter Junkworks </em>had flown under my radar, but it&#39;s firmly on there after a gameplay trailer was featured in the Convergence showcase. It&#39;s a Tetris-style game in which you can slam parts of each tetromino into gaps further down the screen.</p>
<p>This arcade puzzler from Pixel Drake has a narrative that involves a trio of ragtag travelers learning to work together and make something of a spaceship salvage yard. <em>Jupiter Junkworks </em>is coming to <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2913540/Jupiter_Junkworks/">Steam</a> and Switch, and there&#39;s a demo on the former.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be an indie game roundup without a Metroidvania, and this week Critical Reflex showed off one that&#39;s also a dating sim. There&#39;s a new <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190700/Altered_Alma/">Steam demo</a> available (but no release date as yet) for 2Awesome Studio&#39;s <em>Altered Alma</em>, the trailer for which is drenched in a lovely &quot;cyberpink.&quot;</p>
<div id="1836c5334f674affa440746ca6b7894d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKBgNQrDVVw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Okay, how about another Metroidvania? Solo developer Eric Manahan (aka The Matte Black Studio) is billing <em>Lucid </em>as the first &quot;Celestoidvania&quot; — take a wild guess which platformer <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-06-celeste-free-dlc-physical-release-extremely-ok-games.html">it&#39;s taking inspiration from</a>.</p>
<p>One other reason to get excited about <em>Lucid </em>is that it features music from bearbot and the legendary David Wise, who famously worked on the Donkey Kong Country series. Fingers crossed that the crystalpunk aesthetic of this game will lead Wise to create a piece that&#39;s on par with <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5rAjOjTGtc">&quot;Aquatic Ambiance.&quot;</a> In any case, a demo for <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717730/LUCID/"><em>Lucid</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is available on Steam now. There&#39;s no release date as yet for this game, which Apogee Entertainment is publishing.</p>
<div id="7cd83a691e54406e8a64a545c981e257"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBriDaxy2E8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><em>A Heavy Morning</em> was the most compelling game to me in the Game Devs of Color showcase. It&#39;s a narrative adventure focused on mental health. The aim is to help a young woman who is struggling to get out of bed to start her day. Among other things, you&#39;ll enter her mind to help remove mental blocks with the help of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques.</p>
<p>The latest trailer for this game from Saf Interactive and co-publisher Bright Gambit features an absolutely lovely art style. You&#39;ll be able to play it on Xbox and <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509400/A_Heavy_Morning/">Steam</a> this fall.</p>
<div id="86ae2f6f4e1647649128d9a7278b7a72"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51U0Wwcmf7A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>I&#39;ll take any excuse I can to write about <a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/skate-story-hands-on-kick-push-shatter-120051976.html"><em>Skate Story</em></a>. Every time a new trailer pops up (as was the case during the Game Devos of Color showcase), I think it&#39;s one of the coolest-looking games I&#39;ve ever seen. Publisher Devolver Digital has now confirmed that along with the previously announced <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/">Steam</a> and PS5 releases, Sam Eng&#39;s <em>Skate Story </em>is coming to Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Alas, there&#39;s still no release date for <em>Skate Story</em>. But Devolver says it will arrive by the end of the year, so I&#39;m glad it hasn&#39;t been pushed back to 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/patapons-spiritual-successor-co-op-lego-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110022924.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/donald-trump-is-reportedly-preparing-a-sweep-of-pro-ai-executive-orders-171856144.html">Donald Trump</a> has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-suspends-the-entry-of-certain-alien-nonimmigrant-workers/">signed</a> a new executive order, which adds a $100,000 fee to H-1B visa applications. It&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-mulls-adding-new-100000-fee-h-1b-visas-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-09-19/">not a one-time fee</a> either: <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/trump-h-1b-visas-fee.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has reported that companies will have to pay $100,000 a year for any employee it brings over to the US on the visa for up to six years. The Secretary of Homeland Security will restrict approval for visa applications of people who are &quot;currently outside the United States&quot; unless accompanied by the fee, though the rule &quot;allows case-by-case exemptions if [it&#39;s] in the national interest.&quot; This new requirement will only apply to new visa applicants, a White House official told <em>The Times</em>, and it will likely face legal challenges. If it does get implemented, though, it could deal a huge blow to the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While several sectors in the US use the program to bring skilled workers into the country, some of its biggest beneficiaries are in the tech sector. According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub">US Citizen and Immigration Services</a>, Amazon has the most number (over 10,000) of workers on the H-1B visa. Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google are also in the top ten list of employers that brought over H-1B workers, with between 4,000 and 5,500 employees on the visa. Walmart, Intel, IBM and NVIDIA have a considerable number of H-1B workers, as well. As <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/trump-hits-h-1b-visas-with-100000-fee-targeting-the-program-that-launched-elon-musk-and-instagram/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has noted, Elon Musk, who used to be close to the president, came over to the US on the H-1B, as did Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/">White House&#39;s announcement</a>, the administration explained that some employers have abused the H-1B visa to &quot;artificially suppress wages,&quot; creating a disadvantageous market for Americans. &quot;Information technology (IT) firms in particular have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields,&quot; the announcement read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump has also signed an order for a new visa program called the &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/the-gold-card/">Gold Card</a>,&quot; which the administration says will prioritize &quot;the admission of aliens who will affirmatively benefit the Nation, including successful entrepreneurs, investors, and businessmen and women.&quot; It&#39;s an expedited immigrant visa program, available to anybody who can afford the &quot;requisite gift&quot; the government asks for. Specifically, the gift made to the US Department of Commerce must be &quot;$1 million for an individual donating on his or her own behalf and $2 million for a corporation or similar entity donating on behalf of an individual.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-administration-to-impose-a-100000-per-year-fee-for-h-1b-visas-041417692.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025, as a few models are getting the axe this time around. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to receive the boot in 2023, and this year, iPhones released in 2018 will be left behind.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-if-i-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-iphone"><strong>What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-should-i-upgrade-to-ios-187-or-ios-26">Should I upgrade to iOS 18.7 or iOS 26?</h2>
<p>When you first open Software Update in Settings, you'll notice two different upgrade options: iOS 18.7 and iOS 26. Apple released the former to address security issues, so you can at least download that one if you're unsure about all the big changes on iOS 26. It also gives you more time to wait for Apple to take care of any bugs on the new OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you're excited to finally have the Liquid Glass aesthetic on your phone and use all the new features iOS 26 has to offer, go ahead and install that one. After all, Apple had all summer to weed through the most problematic bugs during its beta phase and usually releases a new update shortly after the initial launch.</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>

<p>You'll also see multiple useful additions in the Phone and Messages apps.

And for fun, you can now create polls in group texts.

We've rounded up a full list of new features you'll have to check out.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-ios-26">What is iOS 26 and should I download iOS 18.7 first?</h2>
<p>Instead of releasing iOS 19, Apple skipped its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems were released in 2025, they're all designated "26" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues — great news if you don't have a phone that's eligible to run the latest OS. If you're wondering which one to download first, it's really up to you. Do you want to wait for Apple to quash any bugs in iOS 26 or do you want access to all the new features everyone's talking about now?</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>
<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a "<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">new translucent material</a>" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>That said, while it was in beta mode, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html">incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic looks with <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-ios-26-liquid-glass-settings-off">How to turn iOS 26 Liquid Glass settings off</h2>
<p>If you find you don't like the new clear look after downloading iOS 26, you can change a couple Accessibility settings, though you can't completely turn off Liquid Glass. For starters, you can reduce the liquid look by going to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Motion &gt; toggle on Reduce Motion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make your drop-down menus more opaque instead of translucent by going to Settings &gt;Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; toggle on Reduce Transparency.</p>
<p>You can also change your clear apps back to the way they were. Just press and hold any app on your screen and select Edit Home Screen. From here, tap Edit (top left) and Customize. You can swap out to Default, Dark or Tinted.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>
<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can now scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call, FaceTime or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation uses Apple Intelligence and it will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends can now create polls in group messages to decide things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>
<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's been frustrated with last year's <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html">changes to the Photos app</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are back. Library and Collections have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-use-the-new-iphone-camera-app-in-ios-26-141038196.html"><strong>Camera app updates</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Navigating the Camera app should be simpler in iOS 26, as all the buttons and menus are in convenient spots — less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens needs to be cleaned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html">FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected.

<h2 id="jump-link-changes-coming-to-ipados-26">New changes with iPadOS 26</h2>
<p>Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 also has the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look appears on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>
<p>There's more beyond that, so be sure to check out our <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-airpods">What about AirPods?</h2>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this "studio-quality" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>
<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html">Live translation is available on AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC when paired with iPhones running iOS 26.

<h2 id="jump-link-will-siri-get-an-update">Did Siri get an update?</h2>
<p>Siri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point "<a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">in the coming year</a>," so you shouldn't expect any major changes right now. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html">"stripped-down" AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>

If all of this sounds familiar, there&#39;s a good reason, the last time xbox prices were raised was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/microsoft-just-increased-all-xbox-prices-grab-one-before-the-hikes-go-into-effect-192628921.html">only a few months ago</a> in May.</p>
<p>The price increases breakdown as follows:</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ul>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series S (512GB):</strong> $400, up $20 from $380</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series S (1TB):</strong> $450 up $20 from $430</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series X Digital:</strong> $600, up $50 from $550</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series X:</strong> $650, up $50 from $600</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition:</strong> $800, up $70 from $730</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are fairly significant increases, especially when you start comparing Microsoft&#39;s higher-end Xbox Series X consoles <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-raises-ps5-console-prices-in-the-us-153429564.html">to the competition.</a> For example, the Series X Digital (which doesn&#39;t have a disc drive) now costs $50 more than a PS5 Digital Edition. For the $800 Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition, price comparisons are even worse. It&#39;s now more expensive than the $750 PS5 Pro, and at least Sony&#39;s console gets you better performance for its high price.</p>
<p>Engadget has reached out to Microsoft for more information on the price changes. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>As of right now, Microsoft credits the need to raise prices on &quot;changes in the macroeconomic environment,&quot; which likely has to do with the impact <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypxnnyg7jo">tariffs</a> implemented by the Trump administration are having on importing electronics into the US. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that the company has also been shifting its focus away from home consoles in favor of bringing the &quot;Xbox experience&quot; to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, that&#39;s just by publishing formerly Xbox exclusive games <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-confirms-four-of-its-games-are-coming-to-more-popular-consoles-201419203.html">on the PS5 and Switch</a>, but it also includes creating <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-handhelds-will-be-available-october-16-but-we-still-dont-know-the-price-134015698.html">the first Xbox handheld</a> with ASUS and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-and-lg-are-bringing-cloud-gaming-to-cars-133016305.html">emphasizing Xbox game streaming</a> wherever it makes sense. Given the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-xbox-series-s-starter-bundle-is-on-sale-for-220-153432765.html">frequent sales</a> on the Xbox Series S, there&#39;s a world where Microsoft&#39;s entry-level console might still be worth considering. For anything else, though, streaming or waiting for games to come to other platforms increasingly seems like it makes the most financial sense.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html?src=rss]]></description>

The study will be held through an FDA investigational device exemption. &quot;If you&#39;re imagining saying something, we would be able to pick that up,&quot; Neuralink president DJ Seo <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c8Wp2YGpKI">said</a> this week.</p>
<p>The idea is to help people with speech impairments communicate through thought. Neuralink is among the companies testing implants that help patients control a computer with their minds. That can include using virtual keyboards. Translating thought directly from the patient&#39;s speech cortex could speed things up by cutting the middleman.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company already has five other clinical trials underway.

<p>Neuralink&#39;s plans for people with severe impairments sound like utopian sci-fi. Regardless of anything else, success in this field could be beyond life-changing for them. Still, this is a commercial company in which Elon Musk owns a majority share. Neuralink&#39;s long-term plans are where it&#39;s hard not to worry a little.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re currently envisioning a world where in about three to four years, there will be someone who&#39;s otherwise healthy who&#39;s going to get a Neuralink,&quot; Seo said. The company president hinted at what that might look like. &quot;We think that it&#39;s actually possible to demonstrate abilities to speak to the latest AI model, or LLM models, at the speed of thought, even faster than how you&#39;re speaking, and being able to potentially get that information back through your AirPods, effectively closing the loop,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Our world today has revealed where things can go wrong when we turn too much of our humanity over to technology.

<p>On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see <em>all</em> Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/2025-nfl-season/">monthly options</a> for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see <em>most</em> of the games.

They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-live-tv-streaming-service">What to look for in a live TV streaming service</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-stream-live-tv"><strong>How to stream live TV</strong></h3> 
<p>Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or <a data-i13n="cpos:44;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">streaming device</a> and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-monthly-price"><strong>Monthly Price</strong></h3> 
<p>When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the <a data-i13n="cpos:45;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html">price difference</a> between live TV and a <a data-i13n="cpos:46;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html">standard video streaming app</a>. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-local-channels"><strong>Local channels</strong></h3> 
<p>Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p> 
<p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:47;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D9NZTGLF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=HD+antenna&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYFrBzybV7JrmQ6EI0-2SiNJpVRVKi5fSnmf_a2Xkzyj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAntenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels%2Fdp%2FB0D9NZTGLF" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels/dp/B0D9NZTGLF">HD antenna</a>, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p> 
<p>But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a <a data-i13n="cpos:48;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-signs-deal-to-host-live-tv-channels-in-france-153852590.html">recently announced deal</a> with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-live-sports-coverage"><strong>Live sports coverage</strong></h3> 
<p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out <a data-i13n="cpos:49;pos:1" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=upcoming+nfl+games">upcoming games</a> (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.</p> 
<p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a data-i13n="cpos:50;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p> 
<p>I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Peacock TV;elmt:;cpos:51;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peacock+TV&amp;linkText=Peacock&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnRVh_g_jgVhSp7LBrtJVkcMpZ3bn_n25jQbBiVS3P6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.peacocktv.com/">Peacock</a> carries <a data-i13n="cpos:52;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-ui-update-183247828.html">live</a> Premier League matches, <a data-i13n="cpos:53;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-nfl-wild-card-game-broke-streaming-records-103503762.html">Sunday Night Football</a> games and aired the 2024 <a data-i13n="cpos:54;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-2024-paris-olympics-coverage-includes-enhanced-multiview-options-190047120.html">Olympic Games</a> from Paris. <a data-i13n="cpos:55;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-x-ray-replays-thursday-night-football-173723667.html">Thursday Night Football</a> as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:56;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-tv-rights-go-to-espn-nbc-and-amazon-as-tnt-is-rejected-230811550.html">NBA and WNBA games</a> are on Amazon Prime and <a data-i13n="cpos:57;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html">Christmas Day Football</a> airs on Netflix.

<p><strong>Traditional cable networks</strong></p> 
<p>Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.</p> 
<p>Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Discovery+;elmt:;cpos:72;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e3296106-c693-4525-ba0e-6b65767ea99e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Discovery%2B&amp;linkText=Discovery%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNjb3ZlcnlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzY292ZXJ5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXazZwOAuUzjiAAyIuqwqeh0wDkrnetJMWu8rK4iL_fI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discoveryplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.discoveryplus.com/">Discovery+</a> app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly).

Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-on-demand-streaming"><strong>On-demand streaming</strong></h3> 
<p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p> 
<p>Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-digital-video-recordings-dvr-limits"><strong>Digital video recordings (DVR) limits</strong></h3> 
<p>Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.</p> 
<p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-simultaneous-streams-and-profiles-per-account"><strong>Simultaneous streams and profiles per account</strong></h3> 
<p>Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.</p> 
<p>Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-picture-in-picture-mode-and-multiview"><strong>Picture-in-picture mode and multiview</strong></h3> 
<p>Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.

<p>Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tiers-packages-and-add-ons"><strong>Tiers, packages and add-ons</strong></h3> 
<p>Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-live-tv-streaming-services">How we tested live TV streaming services</h2> 
<p>When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the <a data-i13n="cpos:88;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p> 
<p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p> 
<p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-live-tv-streaming-faqs">Live TV Streaming FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-live-streaming"><strong>What is live streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. <em>Live</em> streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-streaming-and-live-streaming"><strong>What is the difference between streaming and live streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-streaming-service-is-best-for-live-tv"><strong>What streaming service is best for live TV?</strong></h3> 
<p>FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-cost-effective-tv-streaming-service"><strong>What is the most cost effective TV streaming service?</strong></h3> 
<p>Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-it-cheaper-to-have-cable-or-streaming"><strong>Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming?</strong></h3> 
<p>A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-streaming-service-has-all-the-tv-channels"><strong>What streaming service has all the TV channels?</strong></h3> 
<p>No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, <a data-i13n="cpos:101;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/">according to Neilsen</a>. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-popular-live-tv-streaming-platform"><strong>What is the most popular live TV streaming platform?</strong></h3> 
<p>YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's <a data-i13n="cpos:102;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/">letter</a> from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter <a data-i13n="cpos:103;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/disney-earnings-inside-out-2-deadpool-wolverine-disney-hulu-streaming-theme-parks-1236176347/">earnings</a> put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s <a data-i13n="cpos:104;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sling-tv-slips-below-2-135658433.html">customer count dipped</a> from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to <a data-i13n="cpos:105;pos:1" href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2024/Fubo-Closed-Q3-2024-With-21-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Growth-and-1.613M-Subscribers-in-North-America/default.aspx">1.6 million</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-safe-are-free-streaming-services-and-websites"><strong>How safe are free streaming services and websites?</strong></h3> 
<p>You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.</p> 
<p>But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The upcoming <em>Football Manager 26</em> will include the officially licensed Barclays Women’s Super League and National Women’s Soccer League, among other women&#39;s competitions, marking the first time that women’s soccer has featured in the long-running management sim. This means you’ll be able to select a women’s team to manage, complete with accurate player imagery, club logos and kits.</p>
<p>The debut of women’s soccer was actually <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/football-manager-womens-soccer-145306757.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> way back in 2021, and was supposed to feature in <em>Football Manager 2025</em>. That game was eventually cancelled, with developer Sports Interactive shifting its attention to <em>Football Manager 26</em>, which arrives on November 4.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the developer first <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/how-were-introducing-womens-football-football-manager"><ins>discussed</ins></a> the prospect of adding the women’s game to its various game modes, it said it would only do so once it was able to offer the same level of depth and authenticity as it does for men’s soccer. Since making that initial statement, the popularity of women’s soccer has grown enormously, and Sports Interactive <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.footballmanager.com/features/introducing-womens-football"><ins>says</ins></a> in <em>FM26 </em>it has created a &quot;single ecosystem&quot; in which you’re not limited to exclusively managing a men’s or women’s team on a single save. To ensure its virtual recreation of women’s soccer is as realistic as it can be, the studio consulted real-life players, managers, clubs and organizations.</p>
<p>At launch, the latest entry will feature 14 playable leagues that span 11 nations and three continents, with leagues in Germany, France, Japan, Australia and more represented alongside England and the US. The <em>FM26 </em>database currently consists of more than 36,000 players, and the studio now has a 40-strong team of researchers working exclusively on building it out further, with additional playable competitions planned.</p>
<p>The off-the-field differences between the men’s and women’s game are also reflected, taking into account the typically shorter contracts in women’s soccer, and fewer release clauses that can be activated in the transfer market. Sports Interactive also used real-world data to inform the average recovery rates for various injuries where they might differ between men and women.</p>

It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for most of the past several months, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple.

In this episode, Senior Writer Sam Rutherford joins us to chat about his experience with the iPhone Air and our final thoughts on the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup. Also, we dive into all of the news from Meta Connect 2025, including the Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. Is Meta actually on to something with these smart glasses? Or is Zuck just desperate to get people away from phones?</p>

It's been three months since the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, and the launch day frenzy is just starting to taper off. The handhelds have been selling at a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-has-sold-over-6-million-switch-2s-but-still-cant-keep-up-with-demand-120011674.html">blistering pace</a>, with just under 6 million units sold in the first four weeks.</p> 
<p>Online inventories in those initial weeks sold out in a flash, and sparse restocks were gone just as quickly. Amazon was left out of the initial pre-order process and didn't list the console at all until <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-finally-buy-the-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-but-dont-expect-a-prime-day-deal-195558235.html">over a month</a> after its release. This conspicuous absence may have been due to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/you-cant-buy-a-switch-2-on-amazon-and-third-party-sellers-may-be-to-blame-183825949.html">Nintendo's frustration</a> with third-party sellers undercutting the company's own pricing for <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-games-070007467.html">games</a> on the site.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We really loved the Nintendo Switch 2 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">hands-on review</a>, and thought it was a great follow-up to the 2017 console that launched a handheld renaissance. We gave the Switch 2 a score of 93 out of 100, and were particularly impressed with its larger 7-9-inch LCD screen, the magnetic Joy-Cons, better base storage and, of course, significantly improved performance over the original. The pricing is a bit steep, the battery life could be better and the dock could more USB-C ports, but aside from those details the Switch 2 is almost perfect.</p> 
<p>If you've been waiting to pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 without having to go on a scavenger hunt, then the Amazon listing should be a welcome option. The months since release have also seen a great selection of Switch 2 ports and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-nintendo-switch-2-games-070007467.html">exclusive games</a> hit the market. Amazon's listing offers the standalone console for $449 or the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle for $499. Sales are limited to one unit per customer.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-changes-on-the-airpods-pro-3">Design changes on the AirPods Pro 3</h2> 
<p>With a cursory glance, you likely won’t notice the design changes on the AirPods Pro 3. The company altered the shape of these smaller earbuds to align with the geometry of the ear canal for a more comfortable and secure fit. Of course, you’ll also notice the newly installed heart-rate sensor upon closer inspection, covering a previously blank surface of the AirPods Pro 2. Once you remove the new foam-infused ear tips from the latest model though, you’ll see the most obvious variation between the second- and third-generation versions.</p> 
<p>On the AirPods Pro 2, the grille protecting the driver sat flush with the surface of the main housing. Now, it’s extended out from the rest of the earbud, with a nozzle-like component similar to what much of the competition uses. Apple also revised the angle of the drivers, so sound beams more directly into your ears rather than bouncing as much off of the sides. As such, a side-by-side comparison of the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods Pro 2 will show you that the ear tips are pointing in slightly different directions.</p> 
<p>There are also some visual differences on the AirPods Pro 3’s charging case. Like it did for the AirPods 4 last year, Apple has removed the Bluetooth pairing button entirely. You’ll now double tap on the front of the case near the LED to activate that function while the AirPods Pro are in their case. Additionally, just like AirPods 4, the LED is now hidden, so you don’t see the dot when it’s not illuminated. It’s a small thing, but as I noticed on last year’s models, it makes the surface of the case look cleaner.</p>

<p>Thanks to the AirPods Pro 3’s revised curves and foam-filled ear tips, Apple is calling this model the “best-fitting AirPods ever.” While I do think that’s true, I also believe that the new fit will take some getting used to — especially if you’ve worn the AirPods Pro 2 before.</p> 
<p>First, the new tips feel very different and seal off your ear canal in a more complete way than the Pro 2’s silicone-only tips. If you’ve used foam ear tips before, you know they provide better passive noise isolation than their silicone counterparts, and that remains true here. In fact, you may need to go down a size to find the most comfortable fit with the AirPods Pro 3. For example, I typically wear medium ear tips, but those felt too tight here. After swapping them out for the small ones, I began to understand why Apple won’t stop bragging about the updated fit.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-upgraded-anc-and-its-impact-on-other-features">Upgraded ANC and its impact on other features</h2> 
<p>Across the first two generations of the AirPods Pro, Apple had already made big strides in active noise cancellation. But with the AirPods Pro 3, the company ramped up its efforts several notches. Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise. The new foam-infused ear tips play a major role here too, since they offer increased passive noise isolation. This trio of improvements allowed Apple to cover more of the noise spectrum, including higher frequencies like human voices.</p> 
<p>In the last week, there have been several times when I had the AirPods Pro 3 in and I couldn’t hear someone talking right next to me. In fact, Apple says the latest model cancels twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times more than the original AirPods Pro. Obviously, I don’t have a way to quantify that, but I can tell you the ANC performance on this new model was noticeably stronger than before.</p> 
<p>The improved seal the AirPods Pro 3’s ear tips offer helps make Apple’s ANC setup more precise. This allows the active noise cancellation system to be the foundation for several of the company’s other features like the Hearing Test, Live Translation and more. For the Hearing Test, you can now be in slightly louder environments without Siri asking you to relocate to a quieter place. And with Live Translation, ANC will lower the voice of the person you’re speaking to so you can focus on Siri playing the role of interpreter.</p>

<p>At WWDC, Apple announced that Live Translation would be coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">in iOS 26</a>. There was no mention then that it would come to AirPods. Skip ahead to the iPhone 17 event and Live Translation was easily one of the most exciting new features announced for the AirPods Pro 3, because it will allow the wearer to translate in-person conversations with Apple’s earbuds.</p> 
<p>Google has been offering real-time translation on Pixel Buds <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-25-google-pixel-buds-review.html">for years</a>, so Apple is very late to the game here. However, the AirPods Pro 3 uses its H2 chip in different ways, and now combines Voice Isolation, ANC and the beamforming mics to enable Live Translation. What’s more, you can activate it on the earbuds themselves (press and hold on both stems), ask Siri to start it or set the iPhone’s Action Button to carry out the task.</p> 
<p>When Live Translation begins, ANC kicks in to muffle environmental noise and to reduce the volume of the person you’re speaking to. Both are done so you can clearly hear Siri’s translation through your AirPods. Siri will warn you when ambient sound levels are too high, asking you to move to a quieter spot so that it can hear the speaker better.</p> 
<p>Live Translation worked well, at least for my Spanish-to-English and French-to-English tests. Plus, a real-time transcription is visible in the Translate app so you can show it to the person you’re chatting with — an element that’ll be useful for international travel. Just know that if you’re looking at your phone too, you’ll see the translation there before the audio comes through your AirPods. This isn’t surprising since the processing is being done by the connected iPhone, but seeing the English version right before I heard it was slightly confusing.</p> 
<p>You will need to enable Apple Intelligence on a compatible iPhone for Live Translation to work. The tool leverages Apple’s AI to translate the meanings of phrases so that sentences have the proper context. The feature will also be available on any AirPods that have the H2 chip inside, which includes the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC. You’ll have to <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/translate-text-voice-and-conversations-iphd74cb450f/ios#:~:text=Download%20languages%20for%20offline%20translation%20or%20On-Device%20Mode">download the different language models</a> before you get started, too. Apple explains that the downloads would be required for offline use, but Siri prompted me to do so to use Live Translation even when I was was connected. Lastly, only five languages are supported at launch: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. Apple says Italian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese (simplified) are coming later this year.</p>

<p>After initially debuting heart-rate sensing capabilities on <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">the Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, Apple is now bringing it to the AirPods Pro 3. Like with the Powerbeats model, heart rate data from the AirPods can be accessed by Apple’s own Fitness app in addition to other workout apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder and Peloton. Basically, if an app works with the Powerbeats Pro 2, it should work with the AirPods Pro 3, and it should do so by the time those earbuds ship. As always, I expect even more integrations will be announced in the future, so don’t panic if your go-to app has worked with Apple gear in the past but doesn’t yet support the AirPods Pro 3.</p> 
<p>I exclusively tested the new heart-rate sensing tech on the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s Fitness app. I’m an Apple Watch owner and that’s where the bulk of my stats already reside. Speaking of the Watch, you don’t have to worry about conflicting streams of heart rate info if you’re using it as well as the AirPods Pro 3 during a workout. Apple explained that its devices will work together to provide multiple streams of data for better coverage of your activity. What’s more, if you don’t wear your Apple Watch during a session, the Fitness app will use data gathered from the AirPods Pro 3 to still log your stats for your Move, Exercise and Stand rings.</p> 
<p>During this review, I used the AirPods Pro 3 to monitor my heart rate primarily during outdoor walks. The earbuds actually support 50 different workouts in the Fitness app though, with HIIT, yoga and paddling among the available options. You can even track a session at the archery range.</p> 
<p>You’ll see live heart rate metrics on the workout screen alongside stats like time and distance, and your average heart rate will be displayed in the workout summary when you’re done. Heart rate info is also displayed with Live Activities on the lock screen and is a tap away on the icon in the Dynamic Island. So far, I haven’t encountered any issues leaving my Watch at home and relying solely on the AirPods Pro 3. The earbuds provided a constant stream of data to the Fitness app.</p>

<p>The improvement to sound quality on the AirPods Pro 3 isn’t exclusively due to its new drivers/transducers. Although those components were revised this generation, Apple’s biggest strides in the audio department are also thanks to increased air flow inside the earbuds. The company developed a new multiport acoustic architecture for better control of the air that delivers sounds into the ear. This allowed Apple to significantly improve bass response while providing a wider soundstage and increased vocal clarity.</p> 
<p>With all of that air to move around, Apple had to tweak its drivers for the task, but also make sure its tuning covered all the needed frequencies adequately. But those transducers remain the same size as the AirPods Pro 2. As I mentioned, Apple also reconfigured their angle so they now beam sound more directly into the ear canal. You might recall that an angular adjustment was also part of the company’s strategy for improving audio quality on the AirPods 4.</p> 
<p>The improvement you hear first will depend on the style of music you choose. Pick something with big, bombastic drums like Deftones’ “my mind is a mountain” and you’ll immediately notice the warmer, boomier bass. Opt for a track like Hayley Williams’ “True Believer” and your initial impression will likely be the enhanced vocal quality. And if you go for a song like Sleep Token’s “Dangerous” that’s more atmospheric, you’ll get a great sense of the expanded soundstage.</p> 
<p>Oftentimes audio companies make claims about sound quality improvements that don’t translate to what I actually hear. With the AirPods Pro 3, all of Apple’s proclamations not only hold true but are obvious, observable improvements.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-call-quality-and-voice-performance">Call quality and voice performance</h2> 
<p>Apple’s best-in-class transparency mode has been one of my favorite things about AirPods for years. No other company manages to handle ambient sound in a way that’s so clear it’s almost as if you aren’t wearing earbuds at all. With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple says it took things even further, making your voice and the voices of those around you sound “more natural and vibrant.” The company points specifically to Hearing Aid and Live Translation as areas where this fine-tuned transparency mode will help, but it will also be a boost to voice and video calls, too.</p> 
<p>Since Apple does such a good job of feeding your voice back through the AirPods Pro 3 and other transparency-enabled AirPods models, you never feel the need to talk louder to hear yourself on calls. It lets you relax and speak normally, and makes a day’s worth of Zoom calls much less exhausting.</p> 
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 support Apple’s newly introduced <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">studio-quality voice recording</a> as well. Arriving with iOS 26, the feature allows you to capture higher-quality vocal clips in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages, FaceTime and any CallKit-enabled software. And when you’re recording video with an iPhone, you can now quickly select AirPods as the main audio source. The earbuds can act as a lavalier microphone with voice pickup that’s closer to your mouth.</p>

<p>Even with all of the new features, Apple still managed to extend the AirPods Pro’s battery life. With ANC enabled, you can now expect up to eight hours of use on a charge — two hours longer than the AirPods Pro 2. This means you could be able to wear the new model for a full day of work without having to charge them. Additionally, Apple says that if you’re using transparency mode with the Hearing Aid feature, AirPods Pro 3 will last up to 10 hours.</p> 
<p>So far, I have no reason to think Apple has overstated battery life on the AirPods Pro 3. I haven’t conducted a straight battery rundown test yet as I’ve been focused on trying all of the new features at various times over the last few days. I will update this review later this week with the results of my battery test though.</p> 
<p>If you find the promised eight hours still isn’t enough, a five-minute rest in the case will be enough to give you an hour of use. That’s long enough to get you through a quick workout or a call when you need to keep things hands-free. There is an important caveat with the case though. Despite the extended use time on the earbuds themselves, the total battery life including the case is reduced to 24 hours from the previous 30. There’s also a new ultra wideband chip (U2) in the charging case that Apple says has increased the distance for Precision Find My by one and a half times compared to the previous version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-competition">The competition</h2> 
<p>Since <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">the “regular” AirPods</a> now offer ANC, Apple’s primary competition for the AirPods Pro 3 comes from within its own product lineup. The AirPods 4 with ANC offer an open-type fit even though they have impressive noise-blocking abilities, so they may be more comfortable for those who don’t like buds sticking into their ear canals. You’ll get Live Translation there too, but you won’t be able to access heart-rate tracking and Apple’s suite of hearing health tools. That might not matter to those who want to save some money though, as the AirPods 4 with ANC are $179 versus $249 for the AirPods Pro 3.</p> 
<p>All AirPods are really a conduit for Apple’s ecosystem, so if you don’t mind missing some iPhone integrations and special features, there are worthwhile alternatives. <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM5</a> remains a jack of all trades, offering a set of features that perhaps only Apple can rival.

The sum of the company’s upgrades here are more significant than the choice to finally bring ANC to the “regular” AirPods last year. The combination of more precise ANC, improved sound quality, heart-rate tracking, Live Translation and longer battery life is a lot to explore. And that’s not even counting the redesign and new ear tips that offer a more secure fit, two items that directly address one of the main criticisms of previous AirPods models.</p> 
<p>If recent history is any indication, the company will continue to add new features to this third-generation version. I highly doubt that Apple is finished exploiting the power of the H2 chip, so it's just getting started with what the AirPods Pro 3 can do.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c87b81dd-4c28-44d2-b00a-481abbeda6a2" />

Between the heaviness and any necessary cords, they can just be a pain.

It took two and a half hours to charge an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to 90 percent. However, it could boost the battery to 40 percent in just under an hour. Overall, though, the minimalist design and easy to grip matte texture, really sold it to us.</p>

Sure, it’s got a bigger screen and it's unbelievably sleek, but no matter how you slice it, that value proposition doesn’t make sense. At least on paper. That’s because as soon as you hold an iPhone Air, you instantly get a sense that this handset represents much more than a simple quest for thinness. The iPhone Air is a device with a mission: To push the company’s design and engineering further than ever before while doubling down on style. Plus, it’s potentially laying the foundation for something even more radical down the line.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-the-iphone-air">What is the iPhone Air?</h2> 
<p>New iPhones generally don't need to be explained, but the Air is a different sort of iPhone. On a purely practical level, it could be viewed as a (very) glowed-up replacement to the iPhone 16 Plus. However, the Air starts at $999, which is $100 more than the launch price of last year's closest Apple equivalent (or $200 more after its recent price drop). Furthermore, the Air has a smaller 6.5-inch display (versus 6.7 inches on the 16 Plus) and only a single rear camera instead of the two you typically get on a base model iPhone. Then, to make things a touch more confusing, the Air has nearly the same A19 Pro chip used in Apple's Pro series this year instead of a regular A19 processor. But most importantly, the Air’s design is unlike any iPhone that's come before it, and it may end up becoming a bridge to Apple's next era of smartphones (while also being irresistibly thin and stylish today).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-simply-stunning">Design: Simply stunning</h2> 
<p>Even with the arrival of Samsung's super sleek <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> earlier this year, Apple is setting new highs for mobile design with the iPhone Air. Not only is it even skinnier at just 5.6mm (versus 5.8mm for the S25E), it's the best example yet of what I like to call “the sci-fi space pebble look” thanks to its rounded corners and beautifully polished edges. It's a proper marvel of engineering and while I generally don't like saying this, you really do have to hold one to fully appreciate Apple's craftsmanship.</p> 
<p>Despite its dimensions, the Air isn't all sleekness and no strength. You still get a full IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, while the titanium frame makes the whole handset remarkably sturdy. On top of that, the Air has a screen covered by a new Ceramic Shield 2 panel that also comes with an anti-reflective coating. And while it doesn't completely eliminate glare, it does a good job of preventing annoying bright spots.</p>

<p>As for the display itself, there's not much to complain about here either. The Air's screen has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and it has ProMotion support with a refresh rate that varies between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the situation. But the real impact is that when you put a display this good in a device this thin, sometimes it really does look like someone has ripped a page out of a magazine and made it float in your hand. It's kind of uncanny and I can't get enough. To be fair, Samsung's S25 Edge does produce a similar effect but it isn't quite as pronounced.</p> 
<p>I also appreciate that Apple still found room for the iPhone's Action button and a flush Camera Control key. Around back, there's subtle sophistication in the way the Air's Ceramic Shield rear panel slopes up gently to create Apple's camera plateau (though I don't love that name). And weighing just 5.82 ounces (165 grams), the Air's heft (or lack thereof) adds even more to its ethereal in-hand feel.</p>

<p>My main issue with the Air's design is that it only has a single mono speaker. Granted, it packs a punch both in terms of volume and presence, but after years of stereo sound being the de facto equipment on premium smartphones, one-sided audio doesn't sit quite right. The other potential sore spot is that the Air's USB-C port isn't perfectly centered in the bottom edge. But I fully admit that this is the most minor of nitpicks, and when you consider that due to the Air's thinness Apple had to 3D-print the connector out of titanium (a first for the company), I'm not bothered.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-performance-way-better-than-good-enough">Performance: Way better than good enough</h2> 
<p>Compared to the base iPhone 17, the Air has a more powerful A19 Pro chip. However, unlike the silicon available in the iPhone 17 Pro line, the Air's processor has one fewer GPU core (five instead of six). But even with that small shortfall, the phone was never hurting for speed. Flipping between apps is essentially instantaneous and thanks to the new Liquid Glass visual design in iOS 26, doing so looks better than ever.</p>

<p>More intense tasks like gaming didn't do much to slow it down either. Frame rates remained stable in demanding titles like<em> Destiny: Rising</em> while more casual fare like <em>Sword of Convallaria</em> looked effortlessly fluid. The only time the phone seemed mildly taxed was when using tools like Apple's Image Playground. Just watch out if when do you any high performance tasks for a prolonged time, because the the Air can get a bit warm — particularly on its camera bump. Thankfully, in my experience, it never got too hot to touch.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, the addition of Apple's new N1 and C1X chips rounds out the package that the company claims makes this the most power-efficient iPhone yet. That's important because without a vapor chamber like on the Pro line, or room for a large battery, the Air doesn't have much leeway for excess heat or power draw. The downside is that Apple's C1X modem doesn't support mmWave 5G. This may not be an issue depending on where you live or what network you're on, but for those demanding peak mobile data speeds, it is something worth considering before upgrading.</p>

<p>The photos and videos the iPhone Air takes are excellent. But at the end of the day, there still isn't a real replacement for more glass, and with only a single lens in back, Apple's lone 48MP rear camera may be the phone's biggest limitation. In a shot of some homemade cookies, details were sharp and colors were so rich that my mouth was still watering long after the treats were eaten. Same goes for a tricky photo at sunset, where the Air still managed to capture the warmth and subtle tones of the day's fading light. And at night, it kept pace with or even outshot its biggest rivals, including the Pixel 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge — like in my image of a local mural and flower in low-light. However, if you're the kind of person who loves a good telephoto shot or the extra field of view an ultra-wide lens provides, the Air's 2x optical quality zoom means you’re out of luck.</p> 
<p>Impressively, despite only having a single rear camera, the Air still manages to take portrait pics that look practically just as good as those from iPhones with two. Apple says that it reengineered its portrait pipeline to work without the need for stereo cameras for the Air, and it totally works. Now, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice some small discrepancies between the iPhone 17 and the Air on things like flyaway hairs. But in the end, it's nice to see that even without the same number of lenses, there isn't a major drop in quality.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="ce0a3749-dd02-4422-a657-cd4cd7925f2d" /> 
<p>However, in front, Apple's Center Stage feature and the Air's new 18MP selfie cam might be the next big photo revolution that other companies will copy soon. By using a square sensor instead of a rectangular one, the phone can flip between wider landscape shots or taller portrait-style pics at a moment's notice. In fact, there's even an auto setting that allows the phone to switch between the two on its own, depending on how many people are in the frame.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As someone who is selfie-averse, the times that I do want to take a photo of my face are usually when I'm standing in front of a big vista and want to capture myself <em>and </em>the scenery. Center Stage lets me do just that without needing to awkwardly turn the phone on its side. Additionally, while the photos you see here were taken with Apple's default “Standard” Photographic Style, I must admit I like the new "Bright" option in iOS 26, which adds just enough pop and color to your photos without going overboard.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-life-and-charging-not-a-problem">Battery life and charging: Not a problem</h2> 
<p>The iPhone Air's emphasis on thinness means there's less room for a big battery, so you might think longevity would be a concern. But in my experience, it's been a complete non-issue. Officially, Apple doesn't provide specs for the size of the power cells in its devices, though the company does state the Air should provide 27 hours of continuous video playback, which is only three less than what you get from a base iPhone 17. That's a drop of just 10 percent and, considering the sleekness of the Air, it's a trade-off I'm happy to make.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my results generally line up with Apple's numbers. In a streaming video rundown test over Wi-Fi, the iPhone Air lasted 23 hours and 39 minutes — barely an hour less than what I got from a base iPhone 17 (24:45). And in the real world, the Air fared even better than expected. Even on a day with over seven hours of screen on time (which includes running benchmarks and gaming), the phone has 25 percent juice left in the tank. And on lighter days when I'm not working or constantly checking my phone, I often had 40 to 45 percent energy remaining. When it comes to recharging, the Air keeps things simple: a 30-minute charge (either wired or wirelessly) can add 50 percent battery in just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I don't normally mention peripherals during a review, since I'm not a fan of cases but I can understand wanting extra protection for a $1,000 phone.

<p>In keeping with the iPhone Air's design, Apple's power pack is exceedingly slim at just 7.5mm and it snaps neatly onto the back of the device magnetically, so there are no wires to worry about. On its own, recharging tops out at 12 watts. Though if there's a cord lying around, you can boost speeds up to the Air's 20-watt limit. Alternatively, you can also use the pack’s built-in USB-C port to power up any of your other gadgets. And when you need to recharge the portable battery, all you have to do is keep it attached to the iPhone while it’s charging and it will automatically pass through juice as needed.</p> 
<p>But my favorite part is that not only does the battery pack refill the iPhone Air, it can recharge the AirPods Pro 3 wirelessly as well. Admittedly, Apple's slim MagSafe Battery doesn't have the biggest capacity at 3,149mAh (which is enough to add an extra 65 percent charge to the phone). So even though you're paying a premium to keep things super thin and breezy, between the handset, the power pack and Apple's latest earbuds, I really appreciate the convenience for what might be the ultimate lightweight travel kit for iPhone faithful.</p>

<p>While the iPhone Air's thinness may be its most striking quality, it's abundantly clear that this handset is so much more than that. Not only does this device represent a radical evolution of Apple's design chops, it forced the company's engineers to come up with more power-efficient solutions to make all this possible. And in that respect, the iPhone Air is a massive success. It's sleek, it's fast and it's wildly stylish in a way that both fashionistas and people who just like packing light can appreciate.</p> 
<p>One interesting wrinkle in all of this is that the true potential of the Air's success might not be truly felt for another year or two. While Apple might not want to say so just yet, I'm willing to bet that this device will also be the template for an upcoming foldable iPhone. You slap two Airs together, connect them with a hinge and a flexible screen and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y">baby you got stew going</a>. That said, for fans of previous Plus models, the Air's increased price, smaller screen and single rear cam certainly aren't ideal. As long as you don't mind the lack of extra lenses, for those who appreciate a powerful but still eminently effervescent mobile companion, the iPhone Air is in another stratosphere.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, noise-canceling headphones primarily existed for one purpose: air travel. Bose and Sennheiser were among the first on the scene commercially,  blocking unwanted sounds for pilots long before wireless headphones were even a thing. Today, active noise cancellation (ANC) is not just commonplace, it&#39;s practically expected for any consumer headphone.</p>
<p>During the development of its four sets of AirPods with ANC, Apple has harnessed the power of its noise-blocking system to create a natural-sounding transparency mode, develop the automatic Adaptive Audio feature and create accessibility tools like Conversation Awareness. ANC is the basis for a litany of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-take-apples-hearing-test-with-the-airpods-pro-2-173014978.html">handy AirPods features</a>, and with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">the AirPods Pro 3</a>, Apple has honed this set of offerings even further.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As director of home and audio product marketing Eric Treski told Engadget. “With ANC, it was really about extending that capability to other use cases.”</p>

<p>Before I get into the upgrades to the ANC system and the other tools that those unlock, I’d be remiss not to discuss how the overall redesign of the AirPods Pro 3 factors in. First, Apple adjusted the direction of the sound coming out of the earbuds so it’s going more directly into the ear canal. Next, the updates to the AirPods Pro 3’s fit — including the new foam-filled ear tips — create a better seal that helps make the ANC setup more efficient.</p>
<p>“The better fit allows us to diagnose what’s happening inside the ear canal,” Matthew Costello, vice president of audio and hardware engineering, explained. “We can actually make ANC more precise, compensate for leak and also better understand the geometry of the individual ear canals.”</p>
<p>Costello said that the product design team spent a lot of time on the new ear tips, arriving at a silicone-coated, foam-infused version for the AirPods Pro 3. He noted that these tips provide the best seal of any AirPods so far, which I can confirm, and that the passive noise isolation they provide is one aspect of the new-and-improved ANC performance.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-a-more-precise-anc-system">A more precise ANC system</h2>
<p>In order to improve the ANC tech, the engineers employed something called headroom control so that Apple could get more feedback from the microphones in the noise-cancelling system. Those internal mics monitor any unwanted noise that sneaks into the ear canal and prompts the ANC setup to make the necessary changes. The team was then able to optimize performance using a combination of software, geometry and acoustics.</p>
<p>An inherent trait of foam ear tips is that they’re better at blocking higher-frequency sounds, which Costello describes as &quot;more challenging,&quot; so I asked how much of the improvement in overall ANC performance was simply due to this new component. Costello was quick to clarify it’s one part of a much wider system.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s a significant contributor, but it&#39;s part of the overall system performance,” he continued. “The understanding of what&#39;s actually happening in the ear canal helps us diagnose when you need more ANC, but the better seal makes the whole experience more reliable.”</p>
<p>The acoustics engineers, which include a dedicated ANC team, also redesigned and repositioned the noise floor microphones. These are the components that detect any unwanted sounds from either the earbuds themselves or your environment. Since there’s now a more direct path into the ear canal, there’s less room for interference or distortion. A new self-tuning algorithm then takes the data from those mics and identifies exactly what’s going on inside of the ear. Again, it’s all in the name of precision.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s essentially a cleaner signal that&#39;s more predictable,” Treski explained.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-ancs-role-in-other-audio-features">ANC’s role in other audio features</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/497deb30-91c1-11f0-9df7-22318791cd49" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/497deb30-91c1-11f0-9df7-22318791cd49" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Live Translation on AirPods Pro 3 will ask you to set languages before you begin. " data-uuid="aef450ff-6f73-3dbd-86e6-c5cf9109d7be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The evolving ANC setup became the foundation for many of Apple’s features on the AirPods and AirPods Pro. As the noise cancellation system improves, transparency mode does too. Now that the system can account for more frequencies, Costello said that this ambient sound tool is more customized to your hearing.</p>
<p>“We&#39;ve actually been able to personalize transparency, because the pass-through information is much better,” he noted.</p>
<p>Because the AirPods Pro 3’s ANC can now cover a wider frequency range, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-adaptive-audio-preview-automatically-adjusting-to-your-day-130051605.html">Adaptive Audio</a> is also more adept at picking up loud, high-pitched sounds. This increased the effectiveness of Apple’s hearing protection tools, which reduce your exposure to dangerously loud noises when, say, walking past a construction site, being bombarded by an ambulance’s siren or attending a concert. The re-tuned audio EQ profile helps the company better understand when you need more ANC in loud environments, and to better balance the mix of noise cancellation and transparency in those situations.</p>
<p>The same changes also support improvements in Apple’s hearing test. Thanks to these tweaks, you can now take the test in slightly louder environments than before without the feature asking you to move to a quieter spot. The hearing aid feature has been expanded as well, as Costello said the team added more gain so that the tool can correct higher levels of hearing loss.</p>

<p>“Because of the improvements to ANC, the [hearing aid] benefits actually extend deeper into mild and moderate hearing loss, to help even more people that have challenges with hearing,” Treski continued. All of the hearing health functionality on AirPods was developed in audio labs and in collaboration with audiologists. Apple tests the features with microphones in people’s ears, for both validation and safety, under the guidance of those clinical professionals. This confirmation lets the product development team know when these types of features may be ready for real-world use.</p>

<p>The most impressive part of Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-closer-look-at-the-airpods-pro-3-anc-live-translation-and-heart-rate-tracking-193956229.html">new Live Translation feature</a> on the AirPods 4 with ANC, AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 isn’t the language conversion. For me, it’s the way active noise cancellation kicks in to ensure you can hear Siri speaking. When you begin a Live Translation session on a compatible set of AirPods, ANC lowers the volume of the person you’re speaking to and reduces environmental noise so that you don’t miss a word from Siri.</p>
<p>“We really wanted to ensure that you were able to hear Siri and have an understanding of the conversation in the best way possible,” Treski explained. “So, the idea is being able to really focus on that voice and not be distracted from other surrounding sounds.” Costello added that real-world testing, with careful attention to hide the unannounced products in public, is inherent to the development process.</p>
<p>“What started out as something that was really only used in an airplane is now doing things to help you translate language, preserve your [hearing] health if you’re at a concert, listen to lower levels of music or even take a hearing test,” Treski said.</p>
<p>Apple has taken the seemingly straightforward ability to block noise and applied it to so many of the features that have become synonymous with AirPods. The company probably still has more plans for its H2 chip, so there are likely even more ANC-powered features to come.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apple-used-anc-to-build-its-best-airpods-features-130037859.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta&#39;s latest smart glasses at the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/everything-meta-announced-at-connect-2025-second-gen-ray-ban-meta-oakley-meta-vanguard-and-meta-ray-ban-display-100007120.html">Connect 2025 keynote</a>, he encountered two glitches that prevented him from properly demonstrating some of the devices&#39; features. Now, Meta&#39;s Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, said in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18004370228639241/?hl=en">an AMA on Instagram</a> that they were demo failures and not actual product failures. The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://qz.com/meta-ai-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg">first glitch</a> took place in the middle of a live demo with a cooking content creator, who asked Live AI for instructions on how to make a Korean-inspired steak sauce on his Meta glasses. Instead of giving him detailed instructions, his glasses&#39; AI skipped ahead by several steps and continued glitching. The chef told Zuckerberg that the &quot;WiFi might be messed up&quot; in the venue.</p>
<p>Bosworth said, however, that it was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/781730/meta-explains-live-ai-smart-glasses-demo-failures">not the case</a>. Apparently, when the chef said &quot;Hey Meta, start Live AI,&quot; it fired up every single Meta Ray-Ban&#39;s Live AI in the building. And since the event was all about the company&#39;s smart glasses, there were a lot of them in the venue at the time. The company had also routed Live AI&#39;s traffic to its dev server to isolate it, but it ended up routing the Live AI traffic of everyone&#39;s glasses in the building to its server. &quot;We DDoS&#39;d ourselves, basically,&quot; he said. He continued that it didn&#39;t happen at rehearsal, because there weren&#39;t as many people wearing the glasses when they tested it out.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuckerberg also ran into an issue when he tried demonstrating taking WhatsApp video calls on the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-offer-an-ar-display-for-799-002921925.html">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a>. The audience could see him getting calls on the glasses&#39; HUD, but he couldn&#39;t answer them to start the call. Bosworth said that it was caused by a &quot;never-before-seen bug&quot; that had put the display to sleep at the very instant that the notifications came in that someone was calling. Even after Zuckerberg woke up the display, there was no option to answer the call. The CTO said Meta had never come across that bug before the demo and that it has since been fixed. &quot;You guys know we can do video calling... we got WhatsApp, we know how to do video calling,&quot; he said, but admitted that it was a missed opportunity to be able to show on stage that the feature actually works.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-cto-explains-the-cause-of-its-embarrassing-smart-glasses-demo-failures-123011790.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the sake of this iPhone 17 Pro review, I’ve developed a gaming addiction.</p> 
<p>I don’t mean triple-A games like <em>Destiny: Rising</em> and <em>Genshin Impact</em>, or even double-A or non-A titles like <em>Inside</em> or <em>Vampire Survivors, </em>both of<em>&nbsp;</em>which I greatly enjoy. I’m specifically referring to <em>Snake Clash</em> on YouTube Games — the type of thing you mindlessly play while pretending to watch a documentary on TV, or while sitting on the throne, slowly growing a hemorrhoid.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The reason I’ve been playing so much <em>Snake Clash</em> is because I’ve noticed in my year with an iPhone 16 Pro that countless hours with games like this cause the device to burn up in my hands. And maybe some other title might also push thermal performance in similar ways, but alas, such is my taste. (Also, <em>Inside</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em> never caused my phone to get too warm.)</p> 
<p>I spent a lot of time on the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-hands-on-the-unibody-and-camera-plateau-feel-more-significant-in-person-185553855.html">iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max</a> trying to get them to run hot, because one of the most interesting additions this year is a vapor chamber. That thermal management feature, together with the aluminum unibody redesign and three 48-megapixel rear cameras, is among the most compelling updates for this generation. Throw in the powerful A19 Pro chip (now situated in the “plateau”), a novel Center Stage selfie camera, promises of longer battery life and an eye-catching new color, and frankly the latest Pro phones seem like a serious leap.</p> 
<p>For this review, I focused on the performance, thermal management, camera capabilities and battery life of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. I am bundling them together because aside from screen size, battery capacity and price, the two are functionally identical. I also spent time checking out Apple Intelligence and iOS 26 features, which won’t be exclusive to the new hardware and I’ll refer you to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">our iOS 26 preview</a> for a deeper dive on.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-an-aluminum-unibody-design-thats-new-and-familiar-all-at-once">An aluminum unibody design that’s new and familiar all at once</h2> 
<p>When I first picked up the iPhone 17 Pro at Apple Park, I found it refreshingly different from the iPhone 16 Pro I’d been using for a year (and also the iPhone 15 Pro before that). But the longer I caressed the matte edges of my review unit, the more I felt sparks of familiarity. The aluminum unibody here reminded me of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-19-iphone-8-and-8-plus-review.html">the iPhone 8</a>, which is no surprise since that device was made of steel wrapped in an aluminum band. Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 17 Pros use the same 7000-series aluminum alloy that’s proprietary to Apple so that makes sense. Of course, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are far from being as thin as the older handset, but something about the matte finish felt great.</p> 
<p>Two weeks before the iPhone launch event, my iPhone 16 Pro slipped out of my hand and crashed to the floor of a grimy public bathroom. It had landed at an awkward angle on its edge and cracked spectacularly. Thankfully, most of the shattered glass was near the bottom edge, while hairline fractures reached up in a strangely pretty pattern to the rear camera module. These didn’t cut my hands, but I knew I wanted the next iPhone to be a lot more durable.</p> 
<p>With its aluminum frame protecting the edges of the rear and back, there is little chance the iPhone 17 Pro will break in the way my iPhone 16 Pro did. Its screen is now protected by Ceramic Shield 2, so if it fell flat on its face it should still be able to survive the impact. The rear is a bit more vulnerable, since the three cameras still protrude slightly from the plateau, but those are covered by the same sapphire crystal that previous models were. I’ve yet to crack an iPhone’s camera despite my years of klutzy behavior.</p> 
<p>This bodes well for the iPhone 17 Pro, though I’ll say I didn’t try very hard to scratch my review unit. I actually went as far as to keep it in the Finewoven case that Apple provided in the first few days so I could maintain a pristine surface for our review photos. After removing the case, I did put both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max in a bag with the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro so I could bring them around while camera testing, and it was pretty nice to be able to identify the newest models simply by touch. For years, I’ve seen Android phones, particularly those by Samsung, grow more and more iPhone-like so the departure from glossy glass is welcome.</p> 
<p>Plus, neither the Pro nor the Pro Max have been scratched despite my placing them, naked, in backpacks or pockets with other phones, keys or badges with hooks in them, though to be fair the same is true of the iPhone 16 Pro until its unfortunate fall.</p> 
<p>One other way the iPhone 17 Pro is distinct? That orange color, which is reminiscent of the Action Button on Apple Watch Ultras. It’s also fairly similar to the hue on some traffic cones, though in a more metallic, burnished way. Because the iPhone 17 Pro is supposed to be so much more durable and scratch-resistant, I’d argue for simply showing off its bold new color by going case-free. I also took a whole bunch of pictures of the orange iPhone 17 Pro Max I’ve been testing in a variety of lighting conditions so you can better understand what it looks like in real life. Enjoy:</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e166c2d8-31da-4e09-bfc7-2b37b98fde19" /> 
<p>After publishing this review, I noticed our slideshow’s captions stated the iPhone 17 Pro was silver, when I believed it was white. I set about complaining to our team about the error when I was rightfully informed it is actually silver. So you should be aware that the silver iPhone 17 Pro looks white on its back, where the aluminum ends and Ceramic Shield begins.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-faster-ai-processing-and-a-body-thats-largely-cooler-to-hold">Faster AI processing and a body that’s largely cooler to hold</h2> 
<p>Apart from the material and the camera plateau, the iPhone 17 Pro’s redesign had a lot to do with thermal management and battery life. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this review, my iPhone 16 Pro runs hot sometimes, especially in recent months. I was eager to see if the vapor chamber in the new devices was effective at keeping them cool in similar situations.</p> 
<p>In general, the iPhone 17 Pro stayed cool — and that’s both during the first few days with the case on and after I removed it altogether. When I played <em>Snake Crash</em> for about 25 minutes, I started noticing some gentle warmth emanating from the camera plateau. I put the device down on a terry cloth blanket and picked up the iPhone 16 Pro to play on instead, and just five minutes later it had gotten as warm as the 17 Pro. Ten minutes later, I had to adjust my fingers so the iPhone 16 Pro didn’t feel like an iron. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro had cooled down in that time despite being on something I usually use to keep warm.</p> 
<p>That’s not to say the iPhone 17 Pro never got noticeably hot in my testing, by the way. In my experience, generating photos in Image Playground or creating Genmoji typically caused my iPhone 16 Pro to heat up to scary levels. On the iPhone 17 Pro, it took a slightly longer time to get as warm, but it did eventually become so hot I felt the need to warn people if I were to hand the device off. I found the aluminum parts of the handset to be the hottest, which makes sense both scientifically and in the way our skin perceives temperatures.</p> 
<p>I do want to commend Apple for the improved performance in Image Playground and Genmoji. It used to take ages for AI-generated pictures or emoji to appear (especially those based on a picture of someone in my photo album), but on the iPhone 17 Pro I was able to get several options in succession before things slowed down. Pictures where I opted to use ChatGPT’s more realistic styles took a lot longer, but by and large I saw a marked improvement in speed here. Those neural accelerators in the A19 Pro’s six-core GPU are certainly pulling their weight.</p> 
<p>It might be worth noting that in the 25 minutes of <em>Snake Clash</em> time, the iPhone 17 Pro’s battery level dropped about ten percent. The iPhone 16 Pro went from 90 percent to 79 percent in roughly the same duration, so power efficiency in this specific use case seems fairly similar.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-camera-performance">Camera performance</h2> 
<p>The trio of 48MP cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are impressively versatile. Not only are they sharp, megapixel-laden sensors that deliver rich detail and vibrant colors, but also pull double duty and provide additional zoom options. When I was shooting on the iPhone 17 Pro, the camera app showed shortcuts for 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x, which is slightly different from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 5x.</p> 
<p>As I mention those two models, I’m deeply aware that most people aren’t going to be considering upgrading from a phone as recent as the iPhone 16 Pro. So I’ll just say that as long as you’re swapping from the iPhone 14 Pro and older, you’ll get a significantly better camera system. For those already on an <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-review-apple-makes-a-strong-case-for-its-biggest-phone-130018980.html">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, it depends on whether you’re using a Max model and care a lot about some extra zooming ability.</p> 
<p>I compared the iPhone 17 Pro mostly to the iPhone 16 Pro to see its improvements, as well as to the Pixel 10 Pro, since I consider it to be the best smartphone camera this year. So far, anyway. As it turns out, the iPhone 17 Pro holds its own against Google’s latest in most situations. In fact, it’s usually a bit better at retaining detail in shadows in photos with high dynamic range.</p> 
<p>Also, as has been the case in the last few generations of iPhones, Apple’s images tend to be warmer and more saturated, whereas Google’s seem a bit muted and gray in comparison. That’s a somewhat subjective observation, really, and likely won’t impact anyone that’s not constantly carrying both phones around.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-all-about-zoom">All about zoom</h3> 
<p>It gets a bit complicated to compare the three phones on their various zoom capabilities, since they all have different limits and dedicated pipelines. But by and large, the iPhones performed similarly at the 1x level, which isn’t surprising given they’re basically the same hardware. They were also pretty closely tied at the 2x level, and further zooms were slightly different from that point.</p> 
<p>I did find that the 8x option on the iPhone 17 Pro delivered clean shots with little noise or blur, and they were well-exposed in general. The fact that I could now go up to 40x compared to the iPhone 16 Pro’s top limit of 25x with digital zoom was a delightful bonus, especially when I was photographing some geese chilling by the river.</p> 
<p>The Pixel 10 Pro’s scene options are 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x and 10x, with Pro Res Zoom allowing you to get all the way up to 100x, if you don’t mind AI filling in some gaps. I would caution against that, given the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1n4uoya/100x_zoom_fail_or_win/">strange things it’s generated so far</a>, but you’ll also still be able to use Super Res Zoom for up to 20x zoom without any generative AI assistance, just good ol’ computational photography (Math).</p> 
<p>For what it’s worth, none of the photos beyond 8x on the iPhone 17 Pro and 10x on the Pixel 10 Pro look <em>great</em>. But in pictures I took of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water%27s_Soul">“Water’s Soul” sculpture</a> from my vantage point along the waterfront in downtown Jersey City, the Google version delivered cleaner lines and generally looked more sharp. I have yet to encounter obviously weird hallucinations in my photos, though in one close-up shot of a window in a skyscraper, the Pixel turned a white object inside the building into what appeared to be a smear of bird poop.</p> 
<p>As an aside, I also had to wonder what the lettering on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Getty Images;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba566d4a-8272-4b62-872d-a4b9d77bc784&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d2365144-c57d-4734-832f-bc13ac1f7076&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Getty+Images&amp;linkText=Hoboken+Terminal+clock+tower&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXR0eWltYWdlcy5jb20vcGhvdG9zL2hvYm9rZW4tY2xvY2stdG93ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyMzY1MTQ0LWM1N2QtNDczNC04MzJmLWJjMTNhYzFmNzA3NiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2V0dHlpbWFnZXMuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy9ob2Jva2VuLWNsb2NrLXRvd2VyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATNfmY9iBGVKD6oLqks5InKENgmeVfu1e111rd7c5E2G&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fphotos%2Fhoboken-clock-tower" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/hoboken-clock-tower">Hoboken Terminal clock tower</a> actually looked like up close, since the Pixel-rendered image had the word “Lackawanna” seem like it had bulbs or dots.</p> 
<p>In short, you can get up closer to faraway subjects with a Pixel 10 Pro and typically get cleaner photos, but be mindful that the AI might generate some weird things. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro delivers solid quality at 8x and gives you greater flexibility than it did before.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-portrait-mode-is-better-now">Portrait mode is better now</h3> 
<p>Apple is even closing the gap that Google has had in the last few years in Portrait mode, with its updated engine for photos with digitally applied background blur. The differences, I’ve learned, are in overall Portrait quality at the 2x zoom level, as well as refinements in separation of stray hairs from the background across the mode.</p> 
<p>In these portraits I shot of a friend, as well as of a dog statue with a furry tail, there was a significant improvement, particularly at 2x zoom (which is the level I always use for portraits on an iPhone anyway). The iPhone 16 Pro blended some bits of hair (and fur) that stuck out of the silhouette into the mudded background, while the iPhone 17 Pro managed to accurately keep both in focus.</p>

<p>When I compared the portraits by the iPhone 17 Pro to those from the Pixel 10 Pro, it was a close fight. While the Pixel was better at keeping definition along my friend’s temples, the iPhone was slightly better at mimicking the falloff in focus you'd get from a standalone camera with a large sensor. This is especially noticeable with the tuft of blonde hair poking out of her post-cardio ponytail, which the Pixel blurred completely into the background, while the iPhone 17 Pro kept it more in focus.</p> 
<p>I will point out that I still prefer Google’s approach when it comes to shooting in portrait mode. In the dedicated mode on iPhones, you have to wait till the interface lights up to take your shot. That's outside of the usual photo mode where the effect kicks in as soon as it detects faces of people and some animals. On a Pixel, you can simply swipe to Portrait mode, aim your camera and snap — no need to wait for the system to tell you it's okay to shoot.</p> 
<p>It’s also worth noting that people might prefer how they look with the coloration of the iPhone shots compared to the Pixel’s, regardless of which is truer to life. You can always edit a picture in post-processing to get it to your desired representation, of course, and Apple’s portraits are also subject to the specific style chosen by the photographer.</p> 
<p>I do want to shout out how much I love Apple’s Photographic Styles, which are basically sophisticated filters that apply effects based on depth maps. This year, the company added a new Bright style, which makes everything pop in a pleasant way (and is similar to my once-favorite Instagram filter “Oslo,” that is unfortunately no longer available).</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="63580d74-511b-4aa8-b510-534614638b2e" /> 
<h3 id="jump-link-center-stage-square-sensor-for-portrait-and-landscape-selfies">Center Stage square sensor for portrait and landscape selfies</h3> 
<p>Apple’s latest selfie-camera update is, quite simply, a stroke of genius. I know it sounds hyperbolic, and I want to reassure the skeptics that I was on your side. At first. But I was won over when, almost immediately after saying I didn’t see the practical use for Center Stage in selfies, I was forced to turn my iPhone horizontally so I could squeeze in an extra person when trying to grab a photo of myself and my <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=771FveCFj2k">podcast guests Karissa Bell and <em>The Verge’s</em> Allison Johnson</a>. Nothing convinces as quickly as instant shame.</p> 
<p>I was all the more persuaded when I paired Center Stage with a timer or remote control of the selfie camera and placed the iPhone 17 Pro Max on a table. A group of seven or so friends and I gathered in front of the device and watched it flip into landscape mode as more of us got into the scene. It has been helpful in a number of unexpected ways.</p> 
<p>If you’re like me and have grown used to zooming out whenever you flip over to the iPhone’s front camera, you’ll find that tapping the onscreen button to do so will disable Center Stage for that photo session. Don’t fret though, whenever you exit the camera app and relaunch it, Center Stage will be on again. You can turn it off altogether by tapping the button on the top right of the viewfinder and disabling both the zoom and orientation options. Or you can select one of the two, whichever you prefer to have.</p> 
<p>I’ll also point out that the camera is sharper now, as the 24MP square sensor delivers 18MP selfies, compared to the 12MP TrueDepth system before. Though I‘ve noticed some issues with FaceID, no changes have been made to either TrueDepth or FaceID, so it’s likely my struggles were to do with the way I had set it up on the iPhone 17 Pro compared to the 16 Pro.</p> 
<p>I’m not usually a fan of higher-resolution selfies, and did notice my freckles were a lot more prominent in some sunlit shots, but by and large the images haven’t been jarringly different.</p> 
<p>Center Stage also works on FaceTime calls, although there it mostly tries to keep your face centered, similarly to how it functions on iPad and Macbook. However, the execution is slightly different, since it’s meant for hand-held calls as you’re walking on the street, for example, or when you don’t have a stable surface to place your phone. I would have loved it if my partner had Center Stage when he FaceTimed me from the streets of New York during a wild night out on the town.</p> 
<p>When I called my coworker and paced around a large meeting room, we both noticed the difference with Center Stage and after I turned it off. It was most obvious when I stood still, held out my arm and didn’t move it, then shifted my head around. The iPhone 17 Pro adjusted the background and view of the call to keep my face fully in frame. Now I want to use Center Stage whenever I’m forced to hold my phone during a FaceTime (like an impromptu therapy session, for instance), so I can worry less about whether I’m in view and focus on the conversation.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but my selfie video angle is quite different from my regular angle. That is to say, I hold my hand stretched out farther away from my body, sometimes higher up than my face, tilted slightly down. I find it more flattering. When I shoot anything using the rear cameras, I simply hold it up in front of my face, not as far away as it would be for a selfie.</p> 
<p>What I’m trying to say is: I didn’t like most of the dual-camera videos I shot because I could either prioritize the angle for the selfie camera, which might not be great for the rear sensor. Or I could focus on shooting what was behind the phone and include beautiful footage of my forehead. And I’ll be honest, I frequently found myself staring at my face in the little picture-in-picture box and sometimes even moved the phone around to show landmarks behind me, only to realize the main camera (and the rest of the screen) had already been recording it all along.</p> 
<p>I don’t think there will be too many situations where dual-camera videos will be useful or share-worthy, but at least it’s a mode you turn on only when you want and isn’t in the way. Plus, for the specific times when you want to show off where you’re at while proving you’re also in the scene, it’s a nice tool to have handy. I did end up liking one dual-camera video I shot of myself enjoying the breeze by the Hudson River.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-greater-battery-life">Greater battery life</h2> 
<p>I had one goal during this review, and that was to see if the iPhone 17 Pro or Pro Max would be able to last during my testing period without needing a charge. Since there was supposedly more space and better efficiency thanks to the redesign creating more room for the battery, I thought, perhaps naively, that maybe there would be a leap in endurance.</p> 
<p>Alas, I was wrong. The smaller Pro fell short of those admittedly great expectations, the Pro Max did come close. Usually, the larger handset lasts about two full days as I go about my review process, which typically mostly involves camera testing, messaging and gaming. I tend to spend more time on the smaller device, using it for tasks like banking, emailing, social media browsing and posting, all in addition to the things I do on the Max. All that is to say that the two days I normally get out of the Pro Max is likely due in part to the fact that I use it less than the Pro, so don’t expect yours to last that long.</p> 
<p>With that in mind, the iPhone 17 Pro Max made it to the end of Saturday before it dropped to 20 percent, having last been charged to about 95 percent on Thursday at 8:54AM. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro typically gets from 7AM till about 11pm ET without breaking a sweat. I still plugged it in overnight though, because I generally don’t like leaving the house in the morning with less than 50 percent, and the iPhone 17 Pro usually ends the day close to 25 percent. So far it mirrors my experience with the iPhone 16 Pro, though I’ll need a bit more time to better gauge the differences.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-ios-26-updates-and-other-areas-of-improvement">iOS 26 updates and other areas of improvement</h2> 
<p>I can’t write a review of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max and not mention their screen sizes, so here: they’re 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches respectively. ProMotion’s adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz continue to make scrolling Reddit a breeze, and while Apple has improved the anti-reflection treatment here, it’s been hard for me to determine what’s changed.</p> 
<p>The more obvious refresh when using the iPhone 17 Pro is in iOS 26, which rolled out this week to the public. Friends have already begun to complain about or compliment the new Liquid Glass aesthetic, and one buddy immediately had to turn on the “reduce transparency” option.</p> 
<p>There’s a lot I could say about how much I appreciate the bigger buttons throughout the system, or the new lock screen styles. I could also go on about how I had to adjust to the new Screenshots interface and hate that it now requires an extra swipe to dismiss. The revamped Photos, Camera and Phone apps are… fine. I don’t hate the changes, and actually like the new Phone layout.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, iOS 26 feels like a significant refresh that matches the vibes of Apple’s new hardware — especially the Air. But because it also rolls out to several previous generations, it’s not something that will impact your (or my) evaluation of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-why-a-pro-and-not-an-air-or-the-iphone-17">Why a Pro and not an Air or the iPhone 17?</h2> 
<p>This year, the iPhone Air actually feels like the status symbol model for those who need to own fancy hardware for external validation. It’s impressively svelte, has an A19 Pro chip and is just something I can’t stop trying to wave in people’s faces to get them to touch. It supplants the Plus model, at least this year, and has a medium-sized 6.5-inch screen that might be ideal for many. And despite its thin profile, the iPhone Air still managed to deliver respectable battery life, according to my colleague Sam Rutherford.</p> 
<p>If a 6.5-inch screen or a super thin phone is something you simply must have, by all means go for the iPhone Air. But because I love to shoot ultrawide shots as well as closeups of distant, skittish wildlife, a versatile multi-camera setup is a must for me. If that sounds like you, pick a Pro. Whether you opt for the Max boils down to your preference for size (and I have to admit using the larger 6.9-inch screen was a lot easier on my eyes).</p> 
<p>Those with unlimited resources can, of course, get both. Congrats on the wealth.</p> 
<p>People with partners or family members that are looking to upgrade at the same time can consider getting one of each. I’ve suggested that to my friends who are married, so the person who cares more about photos gets the Pro and the one who hates bulk gets the Air. Neither is a bad purchase, but the Pro is slightly more reliable. In exchange, you’ll have to fork over more money and give up some pocket space.</p> 
<p>Finally, it’s worth looking seriously at the iPhone 17 this year. With its new ProMotion screen, dual 48MP rear cameras and Center Stage selfie setup (that supports the same dual-camera video feature as the Pros), it’s a compelling package for hundreds less. You’ll even get the same Portrait mode that the 17 Pros offer, while the Air has its own specific image pipeline that enables automatic depth capture with a single camera.</p> 
<p>If you’re a video creator or producer, I should point out that the iPhone Air's USB-C port is only rated for USB 2 transfer speeds of 480Mbps and doesn't support DisplayPort for video out. The regular iPhone 17 is also USB 2, but does support DisplayPort, while the Pro line can handle USB 3 speeds of up to 10Gbps and DisplayPort.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>This year’s iPhone lineup is forcing me to re-think the idea of a Pro phone. Is it one that <em>looks</em> and feels expensive or is it one that’s slightly more durable and maybe doesn’t appear as stylish? I’ve seen some discourse online about how the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max don’t look as classy as before and that the iPhone Air seems to be the more premium of the family. And while I agree that the Air is a shinier, more attractive device, for my needs the iPhone 17 Pro is still the way to go.</p> 
<p>Of course, it would be better if Apple didn’t create this conundrum with this year’s iPhones, but it still has to obey the laws of physics. I like a reliable, durable phone that easily lasts all day, takes great pictures from all distances and angles and won’t burn a literal hole in my pocket. It might burn up your wallet, since the $1,099 price is certainly not something everyone can afford, but it does buy some security and longevity.</p> 
<p>The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are a significant update from previous models, and I haven’t felt this excited by a new generation of iPhones in a very long time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The most noteworthy of these is Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-includes-5g-and-a-hypertension-tracking-feature-172451506.html">new hypertension alerts system</a>, which only <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-approval-for-hypertension-alerts-120046036.html">received FDA clearance last week</a> soon after <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event/">the “Awe dropping” launch event</a>. It wasn't until early this week that I was able to test and set up the feature, which I did in the days after this review was published. That required making sure I had the latest version of iOS 26, going into the Health app, searching for the Heart section and looking for “hypertension notifications.” I went through the setup process, where I really only needed to input whether I was above the age of 22 and if I had ever been diagnosed with hypertension. Then, it was a matter of reading and tapping through a few pages of cautionary information and I was told the feature was set up.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So far, I’ve yet to receive alerts that I have high blood pressure, but I’ll be sure to write it up if I do. I should point out that I wanted to try and manually log a blood pressure reading but had to answer questions on whether I had a blood pressure cuff to do so. Because I wanted to use a reading from my last annual physical checkup rather than do a reading on the spot, I had to say no. I’ll have to wait till I’m near one (at a pharmacy, doctor’s clinic or with my parents where they have their cuff) to do so.</p> 
<p>Because of the delay in rollout, I wasn't able to evaluate its practicality in this review, but even after it arrives, you won’t be able to use this feature to get ad-hoc blood pressure readings. Right now, all I can say is I think it’s an important area of health to pay attention to and I’m glad Apple is giving it due attention.</p> 
<p>Of all the newness coming to the Series 11, the one that more people might encounter more frequently are the sleep score, wrist flick gesture and longer battery life.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-a-very-apple-approach-to-the-sleep-score">A very Apple approach to the Sleep Score</h2> 
<p>In the land of sleep-tracking wearables, sleep scores are <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-14-basis-peak-review.html">far</a> from a <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-fitbit-versa-2-review-alexa-amoled.html">new feature</a>. But Apple is introducing it with the Watch Series 11, and as usual, its approach is a bit different from the competition. Whereas the likes of Fitbit, Google and Samsung will present you with a number and some data on how you slept, maybe assigning an animal to represent your profile, Apple’s score is shown in a ring with three colors. They represent the three components your Sleep Score is being calculated from: duration, interruptions and bedtime.</p> 
<p>The first two are pretty self-explanatory; the longer you sleep and the less you wake up during the night, the better your score. As for the last one, Apple is looking for consistency in the hours at which you go to bed. The idea is that the routine helps your body maintain some consistency and better prepare for recovery.</p> 
<p>I’m a huge proponent of getting more sleep, but I never was a stickler for bedtime schedules. As a reformed night owl that used to go to bed at 2AM and wake up closer to 9AM, I now go to bed by midnight and rise at 6AM. I’m surprised that despite having to get up earlier nowadays, I can still feel refreshed and energetic, as long as I’ve been routinely getting enough rest at roughly the same time each night.</p> 
<p>While I haven’t worn the Series 11 to bed for that many nights, the Sleep Scores I’ve received so far have been telling. The first was 82, after a long day checking out of a hotel, meeting up with a friend from Singapore and then moving to a different friend’s home in California. I only got around to unpacking after dinner and a long heart-to-heart chat that lasted hours, so by the time I collapsed in bed it was about 1:30AM.</p> 
<p>The next night, since I was already unpacked, I was able to fall asleep a bit earlier, just past midnight. The result? A Sleep Score of 97, with full marks across the bedtime and duration sections and only one interruption of three minutes. When I finally got home and forced myself to wear the watch to bed, a combination of jetlag and general anxiety brought my score down to 53, with the duration of 2 hours and 17 minutes being the main contributing factor.</p>

<p>Not only did the numbers seem to match how rested I felt, it also felt like Apple accurately detected when I had drifted off into slumber. I did find it funny how the Series 11 almost immediately told me to try and move about to meet my Stand goal for the hour, and even though I hardly stirred, it quickly told me I had moved enough to hit the mark.</p> 
<p>Compared to the offerings from Google and Samsung, the broad strokes of Apple’s sleep score are similar. In my experience, I’d get about the same numbers for those types of nights. But it’s not the Score alone that matters. I like that Apple’s system makes it very easy to see at a glance what areas I should strive to improve. It’s almost like closing your activity rings in Fitness or watchOS — because it’s so clear on the Sleep Score’s ring where your deficits might be, it makes trying to hit a target a little easier to visualize.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, sleep scores on the Fitbit app, which is what Pixel Watches use, will <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236407?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-to-find-sleeping-heart-rate-details">show more data as you keep tapping on the charts</a>.</p> 
<p>I do prefer Google (or Fitbit) when it comes to the interface and data visualization, though. On Apple’s Health app, scrolling through your previous results isn’t as simple as swiping horizontally through pages. I also wish I could tap the “interruptions” scale to see exactly what times I stirred or woke up. I eventually did find that information, but I had to go to the Sleep graph in its dedicated section to see more. It’s just a bit unintuitive and requires a lot of tapping and swiping around to find things.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-the-series-11s-hardier-design-is-a-subtle-refinement">The Series 11’s hardier design is a subtle refinement</h2> 
<p>I usually loathe going to bed with a smartwatch on, but because the Series 11 is so thin and light, it wasn’t too bad. Its dimensions are identical to the Series 10, measuring 9.7mm thin and weighing about 0.3 grams more. As my relatively high Sleep Scores show, I didn’t actually jolt awake in the middle of the night like I usually did with previous heavier, clunkier watches. (I still hate wearing watches to sleep, though.)</p> 
<p>More importantly, the Series 11 also has an IonX glass coating that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as the Series 10, which might account for the slight increase in weight. While I didn’t try very hard to test that claim, I’ve certainly bumped my review unit against lots of hard surfaces, including the iPhone 17 Pro, and have yet to see a scratch.</p> 
<p>I even knocked it against the Series 10 on my other wrist as I laid my hands on top of each other in various yoga poses that involved lying face down, and neither device was damaged. Given that the Series 10 I’ve been wearing remains pretty pristine after a year, I’m confident that the Series 11’s hardier material means it’ll stay similarly unmarred.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-workout-tracking-gestures-and-watchos-26">Workout-tracking, gestures and watchOS 26</h2> 
<p>During my time with the Series 11, I tracked a variety of workouts, including a yoga class, as well as my usual sessions of outdoor walking, functional strength and cross training. I noticed little differences here compared to my Series 10, and the main changes were the watchOS 26 interface. After I turned on Workout Buddy, selected one of three available voices and let it finish downloading, I had to set some targets and connect headphones before I even heard anything during my sessions. I don’t usually work out with headphones on, but I can see the coaching being useful for an aspirational future where I’m perhaps trying to hit a 6-minute mile (my current time is about 8 minutes).</p>

<p>I will note that a lot of what makes the Series 11 feel new is in the software, which will be rolling out to older Apple Watches soon. <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">watchOS 26</a> brings the Liquid Glass style, which allowed me to use some slick-looking fonts on my clock. I also liked the larger buttons across the interface and the refreshing feeling of looking at the translucent cards instead of the version before. It’s just a visual change that makes things feel updated, and my eyes welcomed it.</p> 
<p>The Series 11 also gets a new wrist flick gesture that feels familiar for those of us who have covered the smartwatch industry since its inception. The gist is that you can quickly twist your wrist away from you to interact with your wearable. On other devices, you could use this action to scroll through lists of apps, for instance. On the Apple Watch Series 11, you have to first raise your wrist when a notification arrives, then flick your wrist to dismiss it and return to your watch face. This also works to end calls, alarms and timers. I was able to use this to silence an alarm, as long as I first raised my wrist before flicking.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-that-lasts-longer-than-a-day">Battery that lasts longer than a day</h2> 
<p>When Apple said during its keynote that the Series 11 will last 24 hours thanks to its re-engineered battery, <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html">my colleague Sam Rutherford scoffed</a>. That number is measly compared to the multi-day runtimes promised by the likes of Pixel and Samsung watches, let alone Garmin’s almost week-long estimates. But <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=36cf1f2c-017d-428a-afaa-69f826446fc3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=when+you+consider+Apple+promises+up+to+18+hours+for+the+Series+10&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vd2F0Y2gvY29tcGFyZS8_bW9kZWxMaXN0PXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy0xMSx3YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtMTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2Y2YxZjJjLTAxN2QtNDI4YS1hZmFhLTY5ZjgyNjQ0NmZjMyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3dhdGNoL2NvbXBhcmUvP21vZGVsTGlzdD13YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtMTEsd2F0Y2gtc2VyaWVzLTEwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcVcfO99KLwUnNLAw7y02Nlh9x0rpq-WpdRnaBMygrff&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2Fcompare%2F%3FmodelList%3Dwatch-series-11%2Cwatch-series-10" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/?modelList=watch-series-11,watch-series-10">when you consider Apple promises up to 18 hours for the Series 10</a>, the improvement is nothing to sneeze at.</p> 
<p>Also, 24 hours is an estimate depending on how you use your Apple Watch. Many people only put their watch on when heading out for a walk, run or workout, while others use it all day. That estimate includes time for overnight sleep tracking, with 18 hours devoted to daytime “activities like checking the time, receiving notifications, using apps and doing a 60-minute workout.”</p> 
<p>The gain in runtime is thanks in part to a 9 percent bigger battery in the 42mm model and an 11 percent larger one in the 46mm version, as well as optimizations in software and a new modem that also supports 5G.</p> 
<p>The Series 11 certainly outlasted the 24-hour estimate in my experience. It usually lasts one and a half days, including some light activity tracking, media control and sleep tracking. One day, I pulled it off the charger at 2PM, tracked a workout at 4PM, used the camera remote control and viewfinder for about 20 minutes, went to dinner and wore it to bed. I woke up at 8AM with 39 percent left in the tank. Even hours later at 3:15PM, I still had a healthy 22 percent to work with. On a different day, I woke up with 29 percent of juice, tracked a 37-minute morning walk and had about 20 percent remaining. The energy efficiency does seem to have improved.</p> 
<p>This also means continuous runtimes for specific activities have been increased. For example, you can run for an extra hour while tracking your heart rate, GPS and using other Apple Watch features for eight hours straight. Or, more likely, simply run a marathon without worrying about having juice after.</p>

<p>Apple was also able to boost its low power mode, now squeezing up to 38 hours of juice when enabled. It will turn off the always on display, disconnect cellular and Wi-Fi connections and also limit sensor activity, so background heart rate measurements and related alerts won’t work. I switched it on at 9:20PM one night when the battery was at 86 percent, in anticipation of a long day away from a charger.</p> 
<p>The next day, after tracking about three hours of sleep overnight, a few workouts and general testing, the watch still held fairly strong at 22 percent at 8:50PM. I did have to restart the device and turn off low power mode a few times throughout the day just to check that certain features (like the AOD and gestures) were working, though, so uninterrupted use of the mode might get more hours out of it.</p> 
<p>Charging is also quite speedy. I placed the Series 11 on the charging puck at about 1PM with 8 percent left, and came back ten minutes later to see it had already reached 38 percent. Just over thirty minutes later, it was fully recharged. That, of course, is with an Apple-supplied fast charger.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-which-apple-watch-is-right-for-you">Which Apple Watch is right for you?</h2> 
<p>If you’re reading this review, you’re not likely to be considering non-Apple watches, so I won’t even compare the Series 11 to the Galaxy Watch 8 or the Pixel Watch 4. We haven’t even reviewed that latter one, anyway. You also probably don’t currently own <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html">a Series 10</a>, though if you do and are wondering if this is worth an upgrade, read on.</p> 
<p>For those on older Apple Watches (like the Series 9 or earlier), the Series 11 is a solid upgrade. The battery life improvements will be meaningful even if you’re coming from the Series 10, though if you’re moving on from anything older the impact will be greater. You’ll appreciate the bigger screen with wider viewing angles, thinner profile and general modern features like the watchOS refresh and AI-based tools.</p> 
<p>If you’re considering one of the three new Apple Watches, this year is a trickier situation than usual. Because it added an always on display and faster charging to the <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-acquiesced-to-my-apple-watch-se-3-demands-mostly-220726287.html">SE 3</a>, Apple has made the entry-level smartwatch a no-brainer for pretty much anyone considering a starter device. For $250, that watch gives you everything the Series 11 does, except in a slightly bulkier case and smaller, dimmer display. You’ll be giving up ECG and blood oxygen features, as well as hypertension alerts and sensors for depth and water temperature. Battery life is also a bit shorter, and you won’t have an ultra-wideband chip for precision Find My.</p> 
<p>But with the Watch SE 3, you’ll still be able to access a wide range of health and fitness features like wrist temperature monitoring, sleep score, emergency SOS, fall and crash detection and more. It’s a compelling option at an appealing price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>I don’t expect companies to completely retool their products, especially 11 generations in. The Apple Watch Series 11 is a refinement of an already winning formula, packing a device that’s always on your person with exactly the type of passive features you’d want in something like that. Whether it’s quietly keeping tabs on your heart health and blood pressure changes, or providing better information on how well you slept, or even saving your life if you’ve fallen or gotten lost in the wilderness, the Series 11 is a capable companion. With longer battery life this time, it promises to provide even more peace of mind. Nifty touches like Liquid Glass in watchOS 26, Workout Buddy and 5G connectivity are icing on a rich, substantial cake.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html?src=rss]]></description>

Other upgrades include the S10 chip, a slightly larger display, bigger battery that lasts up to 42 hours, support for 5G, as well as the hypertension and sleep score features coming to the Series 11 (and also the Ultra 2 and several older Apple Watch models).</p>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While I continue to review the Series 11 before spending more time with the Ultra 3 (and the SE 3), I wanted to share what it’s like to use satellite communications on the wearable and how it differs from the approach on the Pixel Watch 4. To be clear, I have yet to receive a review unit of the Pixel Watch 4, so my impressions are based on a recorded demo at a hands-on event. For the Watch Ultra 3, I have a review unit and am using its built-in demo tool to connect to satellites.</p>
<p>You can launch satellite communications on the Watch Ultra 3 in a few ways. Add it to the Control Center or as a complication on any watch face, and you’ll get options to send messages, share your location or contact emergency services. The first two require paid cellular service for your smartwatch. The device will also automatically suggest satellite connectivity when you’re offline, though that’s a situation I have yet to encounter. Regardless of where you use it, a lot of the process of connecting to a satellite is similar to that on the iPhone 14 and newer. If you’ve never tried that before, hang tight, as I will explain the steps a little further down.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-emergency-satellite-communications-on-the-apple-watch-ultra-3">Emergency satellite communications on the Apple Watch Ultra 3</h2>
<p>There’s also another screen where you might encounter a prompt to link to a satellite — in the phone dialer. Whether you’re on the watch or iPhone, Apple imagines (and likely hopes) that dialing your local emergency hotline is your first step. Here in the US, that number is 911. Of course, as a socially responsible person, I didn’t want to unnecessarily burden emergency services and did not try this out myself on the Watch Ultra 3. Instead, Apple representatives gave us a demo in Cupertino last week, and made a call to 911 that was routed to the company’s own call centers.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the process for emergency SOS via satellite is different from using Messages or Find My via satellite because users are likely to be dialing their local services first and foremost. Only when that fails will the emergency satellite communications interface kick in. Once you select the Emergency SOS via Satellite option that appears after a few seconds or when your watch detects you’re offline, you’ll be shown a list of guidelines, recommending you be outside with a clear view of the sky and explaining that transmission will take longer than when sent over cellular networks.</p>
<p>After that, you’ll be presented a series of multiple choice questions to inform rescue services of your condition and environment. Thanks to the Watch Ultra 3’s larger screen, the system’s large buttons and readable font weren’t hard to see, and I could make out the options at arm’s length. A few taps later, we had selected some answers indicating we were “lost or trapped,” alone, unharmed and near steep terrain. The Apple representative performing our demo also opted to notify the emergency contacts set up on the Watch Ultra 3.</p>

<p>Once that was done, the watch displayed an interface similar to the version on the iPhone, featuring a glowing arc and translucent image of the earth. Words on the screen said “Try to get a clear view of the sky” and guided the wearer in various directions to attempt to connect to satellites passing overhead. After a link was established, the words “Sending report” appeared with a progress bar below.</p>
<p>We had to wait a minute and a half for the message to go through, which is quite long, but it was probably not the usual amount of time. At about 25 seconds in, it seemed like the connection was lost and had to be re-established. That may seem like a long while to hold your wrist up, but Apple did say you only need to lift your arm while establishing a connection to the satellite and not while the information was being sent. I believe the rep only had their arm up so we could more easily see the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, when the report had been delivered, the Watch Ultra 3 took us to the Message window showing a confirmation that the request had been received. It also tells the wearer to reply with “Stop” if emergency services were not or no longer required.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-using-satellites-to-send-messages-and-your-location">Using satellites to send Messages and your location</h2>
<p>Outside of using satellite communications when you’re in need of emergency services, you can also send messages or share your location when you’re off the grid. This, again, mirrors the iPhone version of this service. You can go to the Find My app on the Watch Ultra 3 to share your location when you’re out of coverage, and your position can be shared up to once every 15 minutes to previously added contacts. In the Messages app on the watch, you can contact people you’ve chatted with in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>In my experience, it was easiest to add Satellite as a complication to a watch face. Tapping the button will bring up the Satellite screen with options to try a demo, go to Messages, share your location or contact emergency services. Like on the iPhone, the demo is there for users to get familiar with the process of connecting to a satellite, so they’re not completely unfamiliar in high pressure situations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I spent most of my time with the Ultra 3 so far in areas that had good coverage and signal, I never really got a chance to try to send a message or my location via satellite. First world problems, I know. I’ll embark on an adventure upstate soon to check it out, though, and will report back after.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with Messages or Find My via Satellite on iPhones may wonder why those features exist. It’s not just for the frivolous desire to play with a novel feature. You can send texts, emojis and tapback reactions to let a loved one know you arrived in the desert safely for Burning Man, for example. Texts go through with a delivery message that says “sent via Satellite,” so your recipient will understand you have limited connectivity and can’t engage in a full-blown tea-spilling session right then.</p>
<p>Or, if you’re like my partner and sometimes go camping in the middle of nowhere, sharing your location when you’ve arrived at your campsite can bring some peace of mind. (Note: I don’t go camping.) My partner tends to favor forested areas, though, where satellite connectivity would struggle with the dense foliage, hampering its usefulness.</p>
<p>To be very clear, emergency SOS via Satellite will be supported on all models of the Watch Ultra 3, but satellite communications for Messages and Find My require a paid cellular plan. With all purchases of the Ultra 3, Apple is providing two years of satellite service for emergency, Messages and Find My.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-apple-watch-ultra-3-vs-pixel-watch-4-the-satellite-comparison">Apple Watch Ultra 3 vs Pixel Watch 4: The satellite comparison</h2>
<p>That’s somewhat similar to Google’s approach for <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-hands-on-a-long-thoughtful-list-of-improvements-160015292.html">the Pixel Watch 4</a>, where Satellite SOS “is included at no additional charge for 2 years after launch.” However, only the LTE models of the Pixel Watch support its satellite feature, and it’s only available in the contiguous United States at the moment. Google’s version also uses Skylo’s Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN), and adopts similar haptic and audio cues to the Watch Ultra 3’s in the connecting process. One area that appears to be different is that the Pixel Watch 4 will offer a &quot;check replies&quot; button that <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-watch-satellite-sos/">Google says</a> “guides you to re-establish connection for updates from emergency services as needed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s Find My and emergency satellite features will work in 18 countries at launch, including the US, UK, Japan, Switzerland, Australia and others. Messages via satellite is limited to Mexico, Canada and the US at the moment.</p>

<p>As I continue to put the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFHVZYL&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e5f00510-9739-4bdf-ac16-fefc2a381f0e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Watch+Ultra+3&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSFZaWUwvcmVmPWZzX2Ffd3QyX3VzMD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNWYwMDUxMC05NzM5LTRiZGYtYWMxNi1mZWZjMmEzODFmMGUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vZHAvQjBGUUZIVlpZTC9yZWY9ZnNfYV93dDJfdXMwIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdLGuAXWh4NrI7S1UuErnYoSIB05HULJBvw89c6Ek_5h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFHVZYL%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us0" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFHVZYL/ref=fs_a_wt2_us0?th=1">Watch Ultra 3</a> through its paces, it’s worth noting what changes the latest model has over its predecessor. Like I mentioned, it has a larger display while maintaining the same size, thanks to thinner bezels (which Apple said are 24 percent slimmer). It also uses an LTPO 3 panel that enables a faster refresh rate in Always On mode, as well as wide-angle OLEDs for easier reading at off angles.</p>
<p>I’ve found the Watch Ultra 3 lightweight and comfortable to wear so far, and I enjoy tapping buttons or reading messages on its 49mm screen. Unfortunately, I am also a person who wears long-sleeved shirts that are snug at the wrist, making the bigger watches a harder sell, especially as the weather gets colder here in New York. I did find it amusing when the Night mode got triggered any time I tucked the Ultra 3 under my sleeve, turning the watch face’s dials, complications and other elements red.</p>
<p>The Watch Ultra 3 gets the same 5G support, hypertension notifications and Sleep Score as the Series 11, along with watchOS 26 upgrades like Workout Buddy and Liquid Glass. I need a few more days with the Ultra 3 before I can vouch for its 42-hour battery estimate, but it’s nice to see longer runtimes on an endurance watch.</p>
<p>My evaluation of those new features and whether they add up to a meaningful package will be ready soon in a full review. In the meantime, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is available for pre-order and will arrive in stores on September 19.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-3-a-closer-look-at-its-satellite-communications-tools-120012387.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years, the “regular” iPhone received hand-me-downs from the Pro models. This was less so with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, but the trickle-down philosophy was still there to a degree. For 2025 and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5c424396-9e98-4963-a718-4c8c91d2333b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=the+iPhone+17+%28%24799%29&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9idXktaXBob25lL2lwaG9uZS0xNyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWM0MjQzOTYtOWU5OC00OTYzLWE3MTgtNGM4YzkxZDIzMzNiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9idXktaXBob25lL2lwaG9uZS0xNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT8eaN2J1Xn-gKAgf3zIvFRpZBKEHC1ZXAbaJZGb7a3E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-17" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-17">the iPhone 17 ($799)</a> is no longer the compromise that the base model used to be. Apple finally <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-hands-on-no-plus-no-problem-192747122.html">blessed it</a> with a 120Hz display and this year’s most exciting camera feature, Center Stage.</p> 
<p>While it may seem like Apple is no longer forcing iPhone users to compromise, or at least not to the degree it used to, there’s still one big thing to consider. With the introduction of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">the iPhone Air</a>, the company has shaken up the screen sizes across the iPhone 17 lineup. Instead of the previous 6.1-inch iPhone and 6.7-inch Plus model, Apple is splitting the difference with the iPhone 17’s 6.3-inch screen. That also aligns it size-wise with the iPhone 17 Pro, while the Air sits in the middle of the series at 6.5 inches.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>I guess I’m a big-phone guy now, because it’s been a rough week transitioning from the 16 Plus to the iPhone 17. At times I feel like my phone is a toy, and at others it’s like I stepped back in time. I don’t particularly like either sensation.</p> 
<p>Putting my screen size preferences aside, the iPhone 17 remains the best iPhone for most people. Since Apple brought its best new features to this regular model this year, you don’t have to feel like you’re waiting for the exciting tools from the Air or Pro to make it to a more affordable iPhone model in 12 months. The upgraded display and new front camera are certainly the highlights, but the iPhone 17 remains a solidly built device with dependable all-day battery life and capable performance.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-finally-a-120hz-display">Finally, a 120Hz display</h2> 
<p>A big change on the iPhone 17 is the 6.3-inch ProMotion 120Hz display. Not only is it slightly bigger than the 6.1-inch iPhone 16, but it finally refreshes faster now. The higher refresh rate was one of the last remaining items Apple had yet to bring down from its Pro models, and this one makes a big difference to the overall experience. Swiping around iOS 26 feels a lot smoother. Apps like Instagram and Safari where I previously encountered some jitters now move effortlessly. When it’s time to venture outside, you’ll be glad that Apple boosted the peak brightness to 3,000 nits — a 1,000-nit increase from the iPhone 16. It’s a welcome upgrade for the times you need to use your phone in direct sunlight.</p> 
<p>The company also equipped the iPhone 17 with an always-on display, which is useful for updates at a glance if you’ve missed a notification. And of course, Dynamic Island is still there, providing ongoing info for progress on things like live sports, music playback, navigation, ride sharing and more.</p> 
<p>You won’t really notice the display upgrade until you start using the phone, so a quick glance won’t reveal any obvious hardware changes. Unless you do a side-by-side with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, where the size variation will be apparent, you won’t detect any difference. Flip over to the back though and there’s an almost entirely new color palette. Black and white remain, but Lavender, Sage and Mist Blue have replaced last year’s Ultramarine, Teal and Pink options. I prefer this year’s hues, as they aren’t as pastel-y as the 2024 lineup, and that Sage green looks really sharp in person.</p> 
<p>Venture back to the front and there’s another important update that isn’t visible. Apple upgraded the scratch resistance with Ceramic Shield 2, which the company says provides three times better protection than on the iPhone 16. I needed to keep my iPhone 17 pristine for photos during my review, so I haven’t put it in situations with the potential for injury just yet. My mischievous cocker spaniel did get a hold of it for a few minutes, but there are no visible teeth marks or scratches from that harrowing (for me) incident.</p>

<p>For many, camera performance is the most essential aspect of an iPhone, and this year’s model got a significant upgrade there. The biggest change is the new 18MP Center Stage front camera that replaces the 12MP TrueDepth camera. This new version has a square sensor that enables the iPhone 17 to automatically switch from portrait to landscape when more people enter the frame for a selfie.</p> 
<p>After using Center Stage for about a week, it’s easily the best new camera feature Apple has released in years. I can concede that the addition of macro mode and Photographic Styles in previous iPhones were also excellent, but Center Stage feels like magic. I’m not even a big selfie taker, but when I do need to snap one on a family outing, this 41 year old no longer feels like a Boomer holding his phone sideways. The adjustments happen quickly so you’re not left waiting, and if you don’t like it, you can disable the auto rotation, auto zoom or both.</p> 
<p>Center Stage also works with video calls to keep you in the frame. This is particularly helpful if you’re walking or otherwise moving around while trying to have a chat. It does take a second for the system to make its adjustment after you move from the center of the frame, but it’s smooth and won’t be a distraction to anyone on the call.</p> 
<p>Another update to the front-facing camera is a new Dual Capture mode. This simultaneously records footage with the front and rear cameras for things like reaction videos. As the parent of two kids in youth sports, I can see the utility for things like championship games, or even milestone moments at school. I think a lot of people will also film themselves singing along at concerts, but I’m not one of them.</p>

<p>The only issue I have with Dual Capture is that it’s a challenge to keep both the action and yourself in frame. You can’t look in two places at once, so if you want to maintain a centered reaction shot or ongoing commentary, you’ll have to figure out a way to juggle the shots. I’ve yet to master it myself and you’ll likely struggle if you prefer your selfie clips shot from a downward angle.</p> 
<p>The front-facing camera isn’t the only photography-centric upgrade on the iPhone 17. Around back, there are now two 48MP Fusion cameras. On the iPhone 16, only the main was a Fusion camera while the ultra-wide has a 12MP sensor. You’ll get the same 0.5x, 1x and 2x zoom options as before, automatic macro mode, True Tone flash and the rest of the handy features from the iPhone 16 — like Portrait Lighting. If you’re into Apple’s Photographic Styles, there’s a new one called Bright that enhances skin tones and makes the rest of the image more vibrant. My colleague Cherlynn Low compared it to the now-retired Oslo filter on Instagram, and I think that’s an apt comparison.</p> 
<p>By default, the main camera delivers shots in 24MP resolution for a balance of detail and brightness. In general, the photos I took with the iPhone 17 appeared to be slightly sharper than those I captured with my iPhone 16 Plus, especially in details like texture (as evidenced by the photos of pumpkins and my dog Biscuit). There isn’t a huge leap in rear camera performance here, but I noticed a slight improvement.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="11207bdf-592d-4550-adfe-a5da89b766e9" /> 
<p>In lower-light settings, like in my pictures under the awning of my local produce stand and inside a local bar, colors remained accurate and crisp. Macro images were just as sharp and detailed as before, judging from my close-up of a sunflower which you can see here. Night time pics still produce accurate colors, especially when rendering the warmth or coolness of street lights, and those elements aren’t lacking in clarity either. Swap your camera settings to 48MP and you’ll notice enhanced detail in images that contain landscapes, as one example. Just keep in mind that those max-res photos are limited to 1x zoom and any Night mode or flash shots will always be saved at 12MP.</p> 
<p>Besides the fact that it uses the non-Pro A19 processor, the cameras are the main area the iPhone 17 lags behind <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html">the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max</a>. They have a third camera around back — a 48MP Fusion telephoto — that’s equipped with 3D sensor-shift optical image stabilization. That three-camera array also provides additional zoom options at 4x and 8x. They also unlock ProRAW for stills and both ProRes and ProRes Raw for video, and come with a four-microphone setup for “studio-quality” audio capture. If you desire the pinnacle of Apple’s photographic prowess (currently, anyway), the iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 — $300 more than the iPhone 17.</p>

<p>While Apple equipped the iPhone 17 with its latest A19 chip, there’s still a six-core CPU and five-core GPU — same as the iPhone 16. The difference here is that the GPU now has Neural Accelerators on each core, which Apple says will boost peak computing power for AI tasks. Unless you’re coming from an older iPhone, you probably won’t notice too much of an improvement year-to-year. Apple explains that the CPU performance in the iPhone 17 is up to 50 percent faster than the iPhone 13, but that phone is from four years ago — basically an eternity. Obviously, you’d expect to see a major uptick in speed when comparing the flashy new model to such an aging device.</p> 
<p>That said, the iPhone 17 speedily handled any task I threw at it. During my everyday use, I didn’t encounter a single time the phone stuttered or struggled to complete the job. The only time I had to wait for anything was for Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT to generate my latest prompt or make a Genmoji in Image Playground (I don’t recommend asking for “a hot dog thunderstorm,” by the way). What’s more, I never noticed the iPhone 17 getting warm when using these AI tools on their own, but it did start to heat up when I simultaneously started multitasking (playing music, etc.). The iPhone 17 never got more than noticeably warm to the touch, though.</p> 
<p>I’m not an avid mobile gamer, but I did play some <em>Destiny: Rising </em>(a recommendation from the Engadget staff) on the iPhone 17 for my due diligence. The combination of the A19 chip and the 120Hz display provided silky smooth action for the first-person shooter, even in chaotic skirmishes. Plus, the iPhone 17 didn't get hot during my gaming sessions, despite not having the vapor chamber that the Pros do. This probably led me to play a lot longer than I should at times, since the device never got warm enough to remind me of how much time had passed. The iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max and Air all have the more powerful A19 Pro chip, but the regular iPhone this year is a capable mobile gaming device too.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-arrival-of-ios-26">The arrival of iOS 26</h2> 
<p>My colleague Mat Smith covered <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">all the new features of iOS 26</a> in detail, so I’ll refer you to his guide for the nitty gritty on the update. I will offer some quick thoughts on the new software overall, starting with Liquid Glass. After a week with the latest design, I’m still not a fan. In some areas the refresh is useful: I particularly like the changes to CarPlay, the phone app and Messages. I’m also starting to get onboard with the tweaks to the Camera app. But for every one update that’s helpful, I find five more I hate. I don’t like the new menu in Apple Music that sometimes requires an extra tap to reveal the options, which is one of my biggest annoyances.</p> 
<p>I do love the combination of the iPhone 17’s always-on display and iOS 26’s Priority Notifications. It’s immensely helpful to glance over at my phone and see if there’s anything I need to address immediately. This pairing is also handy when it shows me things when I might’ve missed a notification as it first popped up. It’s only been a week, so I’m likely to find other elements I can put to good use as I spend more time with the new OS. And since iOS 26 is a bigger visual overhaul than Apple’s typical annual refresh, the iPhone 17 feels like even more of an upgrade.</p> 
<p>Since I’ve also been using <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">the AirPods Pro 3</a> for the last several days, two features I’ve tested a lot are the earbuds’ heart-rate tracking and Live Translation. It’s nice to not have to postpone a workout if my Apple Watch is charging, since I now know the AirPods Pro 3 will track my movement and properly credit my Activity Rings. I also can’t wait to travel abroad with Live Translation, since the tests I’ve conducted at home have already produced surprisingly helpful results.</p>

<p>Once again, Apple promises “all day” battery life on the iPhone 17. Of course, the company doesn’t quantify that phrase, other than a commitment to 30 hours of video playback or 27 hours of streaming time. My colleague Sam Rutherford got nearly 25 hours while streaming a video as a comparison for <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">his review of the iPhone Air</a>. During a day of what I’d consider “regular” use — checking email, responding to Slack messages, listening to music, calls, texting, scrolling Instagram and watching a few episodes of <em>The Bear </em>— I still had 16 percent battery left by bed time. That’s after a day that started at 7AM and ended at 12AM, and I had the always-on display active the entire time.</p> 
<p>Apple slightly increased the MagSafe wireless charging wattage on the iPhone 17. It’s now up to 25W (with a 30W adapter), which matches the iPhone 16 Plus, and is a 3W increase from the iPhone 16. If you don’t mind cables, you can expect to recharge to 50 percent in 20 minutes with a 40W (or higher) adapter and to get halfway with a 30W charging accessory in half an hour. That charging-to-50-percent time on the iPhone 17 is faster than what you get on the 16 and 16 Plus by 10 and 15 minutes respectively.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-competition">The competition</h2> 
<p>If you’re looking for a non-Apple alternative, <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html">Google’s Pixel 10</a> is your best bet. It has improved performance compared to its predecessor along with an upgraded telephoto camera with 5x zoom. There’s support for Google’s take on MagSafe (Pixelsnap) and the Gemini-powered Magic Cue feature is surprisingly handy. Plus, the Pixel 10 starts at $799, just like the iPhone 17.</p> 
<p>Samsung’s latest entry-level flagship, <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-170040665.html">the Galaxy S25</a>, is less of an obvious choice. Since the series has long been a rival of Apple’s iPhone, it merits inclusion here. The S25’s display and cameras haven’t been upgraded over the S24’s, but it has a powerful new processor and excellent battery life. Gemini works better on the S25 than it did in the past and there’s the solid build quality that Samsung always offers at this price range. Speaking of cost, the S25 also costs the same as the iPhone 17.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>With the most significant update in years, the iPhone 17 is an easy choice for an upgrade for most people. Even if you’re coming from the iPhone 16, you’ll reap the benefits of the overhauled display and improved cameras. I don’t say any of that lightly as I’m not a person who recommends getting a new phone every year. Most of the time, there simply aren't compelling enough changes to warrant it. That’s not the case this year, and if you’re coming from an iPhone that’s a few years old, you’ll likely feel as if you’ve stepped into the future.</p> 
<p>I went into this review expecting to be eager to return to my iPhone 16 Plus when I was through testing. And while I do prefer the larger device after using it for a year, the updates Apple has amassed on the iPhone 17 — especially the Center Stage camera — have appeased that desire… for now. I don’t have much use for the performance boosts that the iPhone 17 Pro or Pro Max provide, and I can’t justify splurging just for a bigger display. So, I can confidently say that even though there’s one less option in the regular iPhone lineup than there was a year ago, the iPhone 17 is still the best iPhone for most of us.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f2caba54-1622-4fe8-b446-2f2d52beaf14" />

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Revealed at Meta’s Connect 2025 conference, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html">Ray-Ban Display</a> has a small, integrated display on the right lens, designed for quick, discreet glances at notifications, directions and even video calls. The clever part is its subtlety; to an onlooker, you’re just wearing a pair of Ray-Bans, not accessing a tiny screen with your peripheral vision. (Although you will appear to offer multiple pensive stares into the middle-distance)</p>
<p>Paired with a Meta Neural Band, which you wear on your wrist, the glasses respond to subtle hand gestures. A simple swipe of your thumb across your index finger navigates the interface, while a twist of the wrist handles volume control. This system makes interacting with the glasses feel impressively seamless and intuitive.</p>
<p>While these glasses aren’t about to make your smartphone obsolete, they represent a significant refinement of the smart eyewear concept. According to Engadget’s Karissa Bell, who <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-discreet-and-intuitive-002334346.html">tested</a> them earlier this week, they are a practical step towards integrating digital information more naturally into our daily lives.</p>
<p>She also tested the Conversational Focus feature, which gives you live captions of the person you’re speaking with even in a loud environment that may be hard to hear.</p>
<p>The Ray-Ban Display are priced at $799 — once again a pricey test of new tech. They’re heading to select US store shelves on September 30. Check out our full impressions right here.</p>

<p>While the iPhone Air might be the scene-stealer, for the best specs and cameras, the iPhone Pro remains the pick. And let’s not forget: It got a redesign too! It has a versatile triple-sensor system for rear cameras, while the new aluminum unibody is scratch-resistant and feels sturdy. So do you want the technically more capable new iPhone or the new model?</p>

<p>It’s here. Maybe it’s just a stepping stone on the way towards that first foldable iPhone, but the iPhone Air is officially here. It might not be the most affordable iPhone or the one with the most cameras, but for style and sleekness, the iPhone Air is without a doubt Apple’s coolest smartphone since it ditched the home button. And you know what? Battery life isn’t terrible.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-magsafe-power-bank">What to consider before buying a MagSafe power bank</h2> 
<p><strong>Choose the right capacity</strong>. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time.</p> 
<p><strong>Understand MagSafe versus Qi2</strong>. All iPhones model 12 and later have MagSafe technology, which rely on embedded magnets to align the phone with a wireless charger and can support charging speeds of up to 15 watts. The MagSafe name is owned by Apple — third-party chargers can’t freely use the term and instead call their accessories “magnetic,” or apply a branded name like Anker’s MagGo or UGreen’s MagFlow. Be sure to check the product details before buying: anything that works with Apple’s technology will be listed as MagSafe-compatible.</p> 
<p>Qi2 is a standard from the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/about-us/">Wireless Power Consortium</a> (of which Apple is a member) and has the same stipulations as MagSafe (15W charging and magnetic alignment). Any company can submit their tech for this certification. iPhones 13 and later are Qi2 compatible.</p> 
<p>The newest standard is <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qi2-25w-wireless-charging-is-coming-to-iphones-and-major-android-smartphones-183013979.html">Qi2 25W</a> and bumps wireless charging speeds up to 25W. The WPC <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/">says</a> a certified smartphone using a certified charger can wirelessly go from dead to half full in about 30 minutes (keep in mind that both the charger <em>and</em> phone need to be certified to get those speeds).</p> 
<p>Accessories, like power banks that support the new standard are starting to hit shelves now. As for phones, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL, Apple’s iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max all support the standard as well. iPhone 16 models (except the 16e) will <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/23/ios-26-adds-qi2-25w-support-to-iphone-16-series/#:~:text=iPhone%2017%20Pro-,iOS%2026%20Adds%2025W%20Qi2%20Wireless%20Charging%20Support%20to%20iPhone,to%20the%20iPhone%2016%20series.">likely support</a> the standard after an update to iOS 26.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember travel restrictions</strong>. You may have seen <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://news.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html">news reports</a> of flights being grounded because a power bank caught fire in the cabin. Currently, the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">TSA allows</a> them in your carry-on luggage as long as they’re rated at 100 watt-hours or lower (about 27,000mAh for lithium ion batteries).</p> 
<p>But some airlines have enacted further restrictions. <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/travel/southwest-airlines-tightens-rules-visible-portable-chargers">Southwest</a>, for example, requires you to keep power banks out of the bag and visible while charging. Even if your airline doesn’t make such demands, keeping a power brick out in the open while it’s in use is a good idea — it’ll keep it cooler and you’ll be more likely to notice if it starts to overheat. Most, if not all, MagSafe battery packs come in at under the 100-watt-hour limit, so traveling should be easy with one.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider the extra features</strong>. You may not need them, but the little extra perks of a MagSafe power bank can come in handy. Some have stands so you can watch your phone while it refills. Some have LED displays that tell you how much charge is left, which can be a little more precise than the lighted pips other banks use.

It has the same minimalist look and pocketable thinness, but it’ll attach to other phones in addition to the Air. Plus it’s $35 cheaper and, judging from the size and specs, Anker’s bank is likely higher capacity (Apple doesn’t list the battery’s size).</p>

The feel is premium and the stand is sturdy, but it got quite hot during charging, took overly long to refill itself and is pricer and a bit bulkier than similar models.</p>

It’s Qi2-certified and delivered a 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. The slim slab of the Anker Nano battery is sleeker. But that one doesn’t have a stand — so if you want to prop up your phone while it charges, go for this one.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-magsafe-power-banks-faqs">MagSafe power banks FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-does-magsafe-do"><strong>What does MagSafe do?</strong></h3> 
<p>MagSafe is Apple’s own technology that supports up to 25W wireless charging speeds and incorporates embedded magnets to align the phone with chargers and other accessories.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-iphones-support-magsafe"><strong>Which iPhones support MagSafe?</strong></h3> 
<p>iPhones 12 and later support 15W MagSafe technology, though only iPhones 13 and later can reach the 15W charging speed with third-party Qi2 accessories. The iPhone 12 maxes out at 7.5W with non-Apple accessories.</p> 
<p>The new iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max support up to 25W charging speeds with Qi2 25W-certified chargers. iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max should also support those speeds after an update to iOS 26. The iPhone Air supports MagSafe charging at a max speed of 20W.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-use-magsafe-batteries-with-a-case"><strong>Can you use MagSafe batteries with a case?</strong></h3> 
<p>In most cases (heh), yes. The wireless charge can travel across a distance of a few millimeters. If the case is more than 5mm thick or contains metal components, the wireless charge can be blocked. Many iPhone cases are marketed as MagSafe-compatible, which means the case itself has complimentary magnets inside and should not interfere with charging accessories. We tested a MagSafe power bank on an iPhone 15 with and without a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Target;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=827d7835-78d6-4491-ae04-c042cab1d6e7&amp;itemId=impact_radius_2092-89182367&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8986e106-bf40-49ec-b584-64a9e8a0f01c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Target&amp;linkText=MagSafe+case&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXJnZXQuY29tL3AvYXBwbGUtaXBob25lLTE1LWlwaG9uZS0xNC1pcGhvbmUtMTMtc3F1YXJlLWNhc2Utd2l0aC1tYWdzYWZlLWhleWRheS04NDgyLW5lb24tcGluay8tL0EtODkxODIzNjciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg5ODZlMTA2LWJmNDAtNDllYy1iNTg0LTY0YTllOGEwZjAxYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFyZ2V0LmNvbS9wL2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xNS1pcGhvbmUtMTQtaXBob25lLTEzLXNxdWFyZS1jYXNlLXdpdGgtbWFnc2FmZS1oZXlkYXktODQ4Mi1uZW9uLXBpbmsvLS9BLTg5MTgyMzY3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUGgNj_ET-0ZFYIyAHqke8Ggxi354PCsqFupVdglJJWE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-iphone-15-iphone-14-iphone-13-square-case-with-magsafe-heyday-8482-neon-pink%2F-%2FA-89182367" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-15-iphone-14-iphone-13-square-case-with-magsafe-heyday-8482-neon-pink/-/A-89182367">MagSafe case</a> and got the same charging speeds and amounts in both tests.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-power-do-magsafe-batteries-provide"><strong>How much power do MagSafe batteries provide?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the power bank. If it is Qi2-certified, it can provide up to 15 watts of wireless power. Qi2 25W-enabled chargers can deliver up to 25 watts to a compatible handset. Non-Qi2 batteries typically deliver around 7.5 watts.</p> 
<p>The amount of charge delivered depends on the capacity. Most MagSafe portable chargers are rated at 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh. The former can get a standard iPhone 15 from five percent to around 90 percent. The latter can fill the phone completely with enough left over for another half charge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html?src=rss]]></description>

At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty.</p> 
<p>Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say,<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/doctor-who-the-well-review-signing-makes-you-feel-heard-200528202.html"> <em>Doctor Who</em></a>,<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/severance-season-two-review-even-before-the-finale-innie-rights-and-humanity-made-for-a-stronger-show-100003889.html"> <em>Severance</em></a>,<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/andor-season-2-review-a-star-wars-miracle-an-ode-to-rebellion-190057159.html"> <em>Andor</em></a> and/or<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-two-premiere-future-days-highlights-the-fracture-between-ellie-and-joel-020029565.html"> <em>The Last of Us</em></a>). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/black-mirror-is-now-a-delightful-escape-from-reality-070019017.html"> something new</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html">cancel</a> at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-iphone-17-case-faqs">Best iPhone 17 case FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-most-protective-brand-of-phone-cases">What is the most protective brand of phone cases?</h3> 
<p>There is no one "most protective" brand of phone cases, but rather there are many that tout extra security for your handset. Some of the most protective phone cases we've tried come from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fave.co/46pHh8g">Otterbox</a>; most of the brand's cases have a bit more protection than your standard phone case, even the ones that are designed to be on the slim side. Otterbox also makes a wide variety of phone cases, so there's a good chance you'll find one that suits your style and provides the level of protection you're looking for. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fave.co/4gyZMM7">Otterbox's Defender series</a> is one of the best you can get if you care first and foremost about making sure your phone survives all kinds of accidents (save for a dunk in a pool).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-silicone-vs-hard-case-which-one-is-better">Silicone vs hard case: Which one is better?</h3> 
<p>Neither silicone nor hard cases are better than the other. Silicone cases tend to be thinner and feel soft to the touch, and they're often easier to put on and take off of phones. Hard cases can be on the thicker side, but they provide a bit more drop protection than silicone cases. Which type of case is best for you depends on the type of experience you want from your phone. It's also worth nothing that both silicone cases and hard cases come in a variety of colors, designs and styles, so you have plenty of choose from to match your personality on both sides.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-an-iphone-17-need-a-screen-protector">Does an iPhone 17 need a screen protector?</h3> 
<p>The iPhone 17 features Apple’s tough Ceramic Shield 2 front, which is definitely more durable than standard glass — but it’s not invincible. If you want to avoid scratches from keys, drops onto pavement or just the wear and tear of daily use, a screen protector is still a smart move. It adds an extra layer of defense without getting in the way of touch sensitivity or Face ID. So, while it’s not absolutely essential, using one is a good idea if you want to keep your screen looking flawless for the long haul.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-the-iphone-17-drop-proof">Is the iPhone 17 drop-proof?</h3> 
<p>The iPhone 17 is built to be tough, with Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and a sturdy aluminum or titanium frame (depending on the model), but it’s not completely drop-proof. It can handle the occasional bump or short fall, especially if it lands on a flat surface — but drops on concrete or at awkward angles can still cause cracks or damage. If you’re prone to butterfingers, pairing your iPhone 17 with a durable case and maybe even a screen protector is the best way to play it safe.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been testing smart glasses for almost a decade. And in that time, one of the questions I've been asked the most is "oh, but can you see anything in them?" For years, I had to explain that no, glasses like that don't really exist yet.</p>
<p>That's no longer the case. And while I've seen a bunch of glasses over the last year that have some kind of display, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses feel the closest to fulfilling what so many people envision when they hear the words "smart glasses."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be clear, they don't offer the kind of immersive AR that's possible with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html">Meta's Orion prototype</a>. In fact Meta considers "display AI glasses" to be a totally separate category from AR. The display is only on one lens — the right — and its 20-degree field of view is much smaller than the 70 degrees on Orion. That may sound like a big compromise, but it doesn't feel like one.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/30113ea0-94ea-11f0-b5ef-5d7b928050e5" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/30113ea0-94ea-11f0-b5ef-5d7b928050e5" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses." data-uuid="6feaa76a-42bd-3213-aa1f-37d4da20ad79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The single display feels much more practical for a pair of glasses you'll want to wear every day. It's meant to be something you can glance at when you need it, not an always-on overlay. The smaller size also means that the display is much sharper, at 42 pixels per degree. This was especially noticeable when I walked outside with the glasses on; images on the display looked even sharper than in indoor light, thanks to automatic brightness features.</p>
<p>I also appreciated that you can't see any light from the display when you're looking at someone wearing the glasses. In fact the display is only barely noticeable at all when you at them up close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a smaller display also means that the glasses are cheaper, at $799, and that they don't look like the chunky AR glasses we've seen so many times. At 69 grams, they are a bit heavier and thicker than the second-gen Meta Ray-Bans, but not much. As someone who has tried on way too many pairs of thick black smart glasses, I'm glad Meta is offering these in a color besides black. All Wayfarer-style frames look wide on my face but the lighter "sand" color feels a lot more flattering.</p>

<p>The Meta Neural Band wristband that comes with the display glasses functions pretty much the same as the band I used on the Orion prototype. It uses sensors to detect the subtle muscle movements on your hand and wrist and can translate that into actions within the glasses' interface.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe, but the gestures for navigating the glasses interfaces work surprisingly well. I can see how it could take a little time to get used to the various gestures for navigating between apps, bringing up Meta AI, adjusting the volume and other actions, but they are all fairly intuitive. For example, you use your thumb to swipe along the the top of your index finger, sort of like a D-pad, to move up and down and side to side. And you can raise and lower the speaker volume by holding your thumb and index finger together and rotating your wrist right or left like it's a volume knob.</p>
<p>It's no secret that Meta's ultimate goal for its smart glasses is to replace, or almost replace, your phone. That's not possible yet, but having an actual display means you can look at your phone a whole lot less.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/cd5d5770-94ea-11f0-9bd9-beed797f3ad5" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/cd5d5770-94ea-11f0-9bd9-beed797f3ad5" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The Neural Wristband." data-uuid="b1c4c4ed-892e-3f74-9f71-1ac40e2d8250"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The display can surface incoming texts, navigation with map previews (for walking directions), and info from your calendar. I was also able to take a video call from the glasses — unlike Mark Zuckerberg's attempted live demo during his keynote — and it was way better than I expected. I could not only clearly see the person I was talking to and their surroundings, I could turn on my glasses' camera and see a smaller version of the video from my side.</p>
<p>I also got a chance to try a feature allows you to get live captions of the person you're speaking with even in a loud environment that may be hard to hear. There was something very surreal about getting real-time subtitles to a conversation with a person standing  directly in front of me. As someone who tries really hard to not look at screens when I'm speaking to people, it almost felt a little wrong. But I can also see how this would be incredibly helpful to people who have trouble hearing or processing conversations. It would also be great for translations, something Meta AI already does very well.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to try out Conversational Focus, which lets you "turn up the volume" of the person you're speaking with, but am looking forward to testing it out when it's available. It could be an even less distracting conversational aid if it works as intended.&nbsp;</p>
<core-slideshow data-slideshowid="984ad0dd-ca99-4a06-9688-02bfb2be8fa4" />
<p>I also appreciated that the wristband allows you to invoke Meta AI with a gesture so you don't always have to say "Hey Meta." It's a small change, but I've always felt weird about talking to Meta AI in public. The display also addresses another one of my longtime gripes with the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses: framing a photo is really difficult. But with a display, you can see a preview of your shot, as well as the photo after the fact, so you no longer have to just snap a bunch and hope for the best.</p>
<p>I've only had about 30 minutes with the glasses, so I don't really know how having a display could fit into my daily routine. But even after a short time with them, they really do feel like the beginning of the kind of smart glasses a lot of people have been waiting for.</p>
<p>Meta Ray-Ban Display is scheduled to go on-sale in the United States September 30. Unlike with other versions of their smart glasses, the display version will only be available in physical retail stores, including a "limited" number of Best Buy, LensCrafters Ray-Ban and Sunglass Hut locations.

This means other companies will be able to create their own custom experiences that use Meta&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-new-ai-powers-are-impressive-and-worrying-181036772.html"><ins>multimodal AI</ins></a> features.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is already working with a set of early partners, like Twitch, which is creating livestreaming capabilities for the glasses, and Disney, which is experimenting with an app for inside its parks. A demo video shows a visitor walking around Disneyland and asking the AI assistant about the rides she&#39;s seeing and other park information. 18Birdies, a golf app, is working on an integration that can give players club recommendations and yardage stats.</p>
<p>Notably, these apps all seem like they work with Meta&#39;s non-display glasses, which means that even people who have first-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses could see a bunch of added new functionality. It&#39;s not clear if the company will also allow developers to also build experiences that can take advantage of the display on its newest <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-offer-an-ar-display-for-799-002921925.html"><ins>Meta Ray-Ban Display</ins></a> frames, but that could open up even more possibilities.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Creators building experiences in <em>Fortnite</em> are getting a new way to earn revenue. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">Epic says</a> developers will soon have the ability to make and sell in-game items in <em>Fortnite</em>, and earn a cut of the V-Bucks users spend to buy them. Previously, developers <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-will-share-40-percent-of-fortnite-purchase-revenue-with-creators-192924916.html">only earned money</a> through Fortnite based on the amount of time users spent on their &quot;islands,&quot; the in-game name for third-party experiences creators can offer through <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to create their consumable and durable in-game items using soon-to-be-released tools in Unreal Editor for Fortnite and a new &quot;Verse-based API,&quot; according to Epic. The company also plans to be generous with the revenue split its offering, at least at first. Developers &quot;will ordinarily earn 50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands,&quot; but from December 2025 through the end of 2026, they&#39;ll get to keep 100 percent.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Epic says its 50 percent cut — notably more than the 30 percent popularized by Apple&#39;s App Store — is to help &quot;contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses&quot; of running <em>Fortnite</em>. It&#39;s also a make-good of sorts, since Epic claims it&#39;s been &quot;investing and operating the business at a loss.&quot;</p>
<p>How much 100 percent or 50 percent of &quot;V-Bucks value&quot; actually equals in real money unfortunately isn&#39;t as simple as converting Fortnite&#39;s digital currency to dollars, though. Epic offers the following explanation for how it calculates V-Bucks value:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite&#39;s average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alongside the new ability to create in-game items, Epic says Fortnite developers will be able to pay to be featured in a new &quot;Sponsored row&quot; inside <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s Discover feed. And to better engage new and returning players, developers are also getting access to new tools for creating community forums and sharing updates on their islands.</p>
<p>All of these changes are in service of further extending <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s ability to act as a platform for games and social experiences, rather than just a battle royale game (with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-shows-off-more-of-fortnites-rocket-racing-mode-ahead-of-its-launch-023944541.html">racing</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-festival-tries-to-bring-back-the-heyday-of-music-gaming-153624729.html">rhythm game</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-aims-at-the-survival-builder-crown-with-its-new-lego-mode-151433897.html">LEGO spin-offs</a>). Epic clearly wants <em>Fortnite</em> to be Roblox, and reap the benefits of having an active community of adult and child users creating experiences for its platform. Cultivating that audience has led to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-15/roblox-faces-lawsuits-over-child-safety">all sorts of child safety problems</a> for Roblox,<em>&nbsp;</em>but Epic clearly views the risks to be worth it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/epic-will-let-fortnite-creators-sell-in-game-items-in-latest-attempt-to-compete-with-roblox-192059073.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The FTC and seven states <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-sues-live-nation-ticketmaster-engaging-illegal-ticket-resale-tactics-deceiving-artists-consumers">sued</a> Ticketmaster owner Live Nation on Wednesday. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/FTCvLiveNation-Ticketmaster-Complaint-filed.pdf">lawsuit</a> accused the company of knowingly allowing brokers to buy tickets in bulk. Ticketmaster allegedly then let them resell the tickets at a significant markup on its own second-hand market.</p>
<p>The FTC claims Ticketmaster was aware that resellers routinely bypassed its security measures for these purchases. The company profits three times from resales. It collects fees at the initial purchase, followed by both buyer and seller fees upon resale. Between 2019 and 2024, Ticketmaster raked in $16.4 billion in fees, according to the FTC.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The agency paints a picture of the company that epitomizes rampant corporate greed. The FTC claims an internal Live Nation review showed that five resellers alone harvested 246,407 tickets to 2,594 events. The agency accused Ticketmaster of admitting in an internal email that it &quot;turn[s] a blind eye as a matter of policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The company is said to even offer tech support to brokers through its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tradedesk-by-ticketmaster/id1231514736">TradeDesk</a> app. The software is designed to consolidate and manage tickets purchased through multiple Ticketmaster accounts.</p>
<p>Ticketmaster also allegedly failed to implement third-party identity verification tools that could have prevented the bulk purchases. Why? The FTC quotes the company as saying these tools would have been &quot;too effective.&quot; The company is also said to have admitted to engaging in deceptive pricing. Their alleged reason: Customers were less likely to buy tickets when they <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/ticketmaster-proudly-announces-it-will-follow-the-law-and-show-prices-up-front-194624489.html">saw the actual cost upfront</a>.</p>
<p>The FTC accused Live Nation of violating two laws: the FTC Act&#39;s ban on deceptive practices and the BOTS Act. The latter was <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-15-president-obama-signs-ticket-bot-bill-into-law.html">signed by President Obama in 2016</a>, just before leaving office. As its name suggests, it banned the use of bots or other software to obtain more tickets than is legally allowed. Earlier this year, President Trump <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/combating-unfair-practices-in-the-live-entertainment-market/">issued</a> an executive order to increase enforcement of the law.</p>
<p>The suit was filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California. Joining the FTC in the suit are Virginia, Utah, Florida, Tennessee, Nebraska, Illinois and Colorado.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/the-ftc-sues-ticketmaster-for-allegedly-colluding-with-resellers-191337586.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&#39;s Gaming Copilot AI assistant <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/18/gaming-copilot-xbox-pc-mobile/">is officially coming to</a> Windows PCs and the Xbox mobile app. The company has been testing the tool for PCs <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-try-microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-assistant-on-pc-184853884.html">with Xbox Insiders</a>, but now it&#39;s getting a broader rollout.</p>
<p>To that end, it&#39;ll be available to players aged 18 and older on the PC Game Bar. The Xbox app version rolls out this October, for both Android and iOS, after a beta test took place <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-in-mobile-beta-183344187.html">earlier this year</a>. Microsoft says that its Gaming Copilot will be available throughout the globe, except in mainland China.</p>

<p>So what exactly is this thing? It&#39;s sort of like an AI version of those old Nintendo help phone lines. The chat box appears as an overlay on the screen and players can use it to ask questions or to get tips about a game. The company says it &quot;knows what you&#39;re playing and understands your Xbox activity,&quot; as it uses in-game screenshots. It can also answer questions about an Xbox account and offer recommendations on stuff to buy.</p>
<p>The official version also offers voice chat, so you can just ask the questions out loud. On PC, there&#39;s a &quot;Push to Talk&quot; hotkey that activates the bot, which is handy. The app includes a microphone button. There&#39;s a widget for the PC build that can be placed anywhere on the screen. This is useful for longer conversations.</p>
<div id="53161d72fd3844f9b56bb28c3aa4f924"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With Copilot for Gaming, you can jump back into games faster, get real-time coaching, and stay connected... all on your own terms.

</div>
<p>Microsoft is still tinkering with this software and urges feedback from users as they &quot;continue to develop Gaming Copilopt and make it even more helpful for players&#39; needs and preferences.&quot; The company has been testing the system on Windows-based portable consoles, and it did recently announce the pending availability of its own <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-handhelds-will-be-available-october-16-but-we-still-dont-know-the-price-134015698.html">Xbox Ally handheld gaming machines</a>. It&#39;s likely that the software will get an official rollout for those consoles some time after they launch on October 16.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-windows-pcs-and-the-xbox-mobile-app-185452965.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steam is officially dropping Windows 32-bit support at the end of this year, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00"><ins>announced</ins></a> today. The only 32-bit version of Windows that is currently supported by Steam is Windows 10 32-bit. The company says 0.01 percent of systems reported through the Steam Hardware Survey are using that version of Windows. On any given day, Steam sees just over <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/stats/"><ins>36 million daily users</ins></a>, so it&#39;s safe to assume that this change will only affect a few thousand gamers.</p>
<p>While this doesn&#39;t mean that your Steam client running on Windows 10 32-bit will self-destruct at midnight on January 1, it does mean that you will no longer receive updates or technical support. Microsoft is also <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html"><ins>sunsetting Windows 10</ins></a> on October 14 of this year, which will similarly mean an end to security updates.</p>

At the time, you needed an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html">AI Pro or AI Ultra subscription</a> to access the AI assistant in the browser. That&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!FPnhblE5ZRQF1qh3yEaV-vyNBFujdOSYQ8M8XaYXIGxYMKw2nVXGU6vz0quRlOZ0ttHqIGYUL1cw_YeecDDYQFuoXznmEQ$">changing today</a>. Google has begun rolling out the tool to all Chrome desktop users on both Windows and Mac. Provided you have Chrome&#39;s language set to English and live in the US, you&#39;ll see a new <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/g-pG79LOtMw?si=UDjEW3S0ptiW3kZv">sparkle icon</a> at the top of the interface. Tapping it will allow you to start making requests of Gemini.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use the tool on a smartphone. On Android, you can do so by holding your phone&#39;s power button. On iOS, meanwhile, Google is working on bringing the assistant to the Chrome app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/b5f68780-94a6-11f0-b55b-2323b93aa75e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/b5f68780-94a6-11f0-b55b-2323b93aa75e" style="height:640px;width:1070px;" alt="A GIF demonstrating Gemini in Chrome, which is accessible through a new dedicated shortcut." data-uuid="f9612ca6-c109-364b-be83-ad55bc618516"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>Since its introduction at I/O, Google has made some enhancements to how Gemini works inside of Chrome. To start, the tool can now work across multiple tabs, allowing it to compare and summarize information from different websites. At the same time, Gemini can access your browsing history thanks to a new recall feature. Google suggests this can be helpful in situations where you can&#39;t quite remember where you saw something online. Instead of manually sifting through your browser history, you can write a prompt like &quot;what was that blog I read on back to school shopping?&quot; and Gemini will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>The new version of Gemini for Chrome also offers deeper integrations with other Google services, including Calendar, YouTube and Maps. For instance, you can ask the assistant to schedule meetings for you, and if you&#39;re working through a long YouTube video, Gemini can generate timestamps you can use to jump around the video.</p>

" data-uuid="21ba87f4-81f6-3270-bcbd-3ceb2f07640f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>At the start of May, Google <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chrome-will-now-use-gemini-nano-to-catch-scams-170057893.html">began using Gemini Nano</a> to upgrade Chrome&#39;s Enhanced Protection suite. On Thursday, the company said Gemini Nano would also soon work to protect users against websites that use fake viruses or giveaways to trick them. Google has also added an algorithm that will learn your preferences for granting permissions. When it determines you&#39;re unlikely to grant a website permission to access your computer&#39;s camera or location, it will present those requests in a less intrusive way. Similarly, Google will add an AI designed to make it easier to update compromised credentials through Chrome&#39;s built-in password manager. Starting with a handful of supported websites — including Coursera, Duolingo and Spotify — you&#39;ll be able to change your passwords with a single click.</p>
<p>In the coming months, Google plans to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome, meaning Gemini will be able to complete tasks for you. For example, the company envisions people using this feature to do their weekly grocery shopping through Instacart. The company first previewed this capability with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/jarvis-googles-web-browsing-ai-is-now-officially-known-as-project-mariner-191603929.html">Project Mariner</a> at the end of 2024. Over the last year, a few different companies have released their own takes on web-surfing agents with mixed results. For example, people have complained of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-operator-can-surf-the-web-for-you-210029243.html">OpenAI&#39;s Operator</a> failing to complete some tasks.</p>

<p>&quot;Our hope is that by the time this gets to users, we&#39;ve done away with many of the potential snafus,&quot; said Mike Torres, vice president of product for Chrome, during a media briefing Google held ahead of today&#39;s announcement. &quot;This is an experimental experience we&#39;re continuing to improve. We&#39;re not going to do something that compromises the user experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Last but not least, Google is adding an AI Mode mode shortcut directly to Chrome&#39;s address bar. If you need a refresher, AI Mode is Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html">dedicated search chatbot</a>. At I/O 2025, the company made it available to every <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-rolling-out-ai-mode-to-everyone-in-the-us-174917628.html">Search user in the US</a>. Now you can access it without navigating to Google first. When I asked Torres about the button, he was quick to note users don&#39;t have to use the shortcut. &quot;What we&#39;re trying to do is maintain users&#39; existing behavior,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As with any major update from Google, it may take a few days for the new features to roll out to your installation of Chrome.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-in-chrome-no-longer-requires-a-subscription-170045611.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html">CoPilot+ PC</a> owners have a new perk in the pipeline. Your AI PC will soon perform Notepad&#39;s AI writing features on-device — no subscription required. The app&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-notepads-latest-ai-trick-churns-out-custom-text-for-you-174257053.html">summarize, write and rewrite options</a> were introduced earlier this year.</p>
<p>Up to this point, you&#39;ve needed a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-pro-is-a-20-monthly-subscription-for-advanced-ai-features-234847522.html">CoPilot Pro</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-phased-out-replaced-by-microsoft-365-104748463.html">Microsoft 365</a> subscription to use Notepad&#39;s AI writing tools. So, if you&#39;ve splurged on an AI PC, this could save you a few bucks each month. And if you have both a subscription and a CoPilot+ PC, it lets you choose between local and cloud generation.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft is rolling out the new local AI feature now for its Windows Insider beta testers. It&#39;s available in English only, at least for now.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/bcb9f4e0-94aa-11f0-93bf-de4303973d43" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/bcb9f4e0-94aa-11f0-93bf-de4303973d43" style="height:639px;width:1065px;" alt="Sample image showing Microsoft Paint&#39;s new " data-uuid="3a089255-0de2-3361-8b44-b5e95b549261"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure>
<p>Paint is also getting some love in the latest Insider builds. You can now save projects, Adobe-style. If you&#39;re in the middle of an edit, you can choose <em>File &gt; Save as project</em>. You can then select a location to save the .paint file and pick up later where you left off.</p>
<p>On top of that, Paint is also adding an opacity slider to the pencil and brush tools. Nobody in their right mind will describe MS Paint as a Photoshop rival. But at least the simple drawing and editing app is growing <em>slightly</em> more advanced. It&#39;s gotten a renewed focus from the company after <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-paint-is-getting-an-ai-powered-image-generator-that-responds-to-your-text-prompts-and-doodles-190653716.html">adding AI image generation chops</a> last year.</p>
<p>Last but... definitely least is an update to Snipping Tool. Insiders will see a new quick markup option in the screenshot app. After snipping something onscreen, you&#39;ll find the feature in the capture toolbar. You can then scribble away before saving.</p>
<p>All the Windows updates are available in the Canary and Dev Insider channels. Anyone with a Microsoft account can <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsinsider/register">sign up</a> for free. The company does occasionally cancel beta features before they&#39;re released to Windows proper. But that&#39;s more the exception than the rule.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/notepads-ai-writing-features-will-soon-run-locally-on-copilot-pcs-163518223.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A former lobbyist for Meta is now in charge of the EU&#39;s chief regulator for big tech firms, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/17/ex-tech-lobbyist-named-to-data-protection-commission/"><ins>according to reporting by </ins><em><ins>The Irish Times</ins></em></a>. Niamh Sweeney has been named commissioner of the Data Protection Commission (DPC), which is one of the largest EU data protection authorities.</p>
<p>Prior to this, she worked at Meta for six years. Sweeney was director of European public policy at WhatsApp and head of Irish public policy at Facebook for many of those years. She becomes the third active commissioner of the regulatory body, joining Des Hogan and Dale Sutherland.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“As the responsibilities and scope of the DPC continue to grow, I am pleased that three commissioners will now lead and manage this key regulatory body,&quot; said Ireland&#39;s Minister for Justice Jim O’Callaghan.</p>
<div id="4a6dd6f9b83849179485204787c9f3e6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 A former Meta lobbyist will join the DPC as a commissioner in October.<br><br>With this appointment, the Irish government does not even pretend to care about enforcing EU law anymore.<br><br>Read our full statement on the matter here:<a href="https://t.co/1AFv9qfKSG">https://t.co/1AFv9qfKSG</a></p>— noyb (@NOYBeu) <a href="https://twitter.com/NOYBeu/status/1968601150468292795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>The organization has welcomed Sweeney&#39;s appointment, saying it looks forward to &quot;working with her as the DPC continues to uphold the EU&#39;s fundamental right to data protection.&quot; However, this regulatory body is notorious <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://noyb.eu/en/former-meta-lobbyist-named-dpc-commissioner-meta-now-officially-regulates-itself"><ins>for being friendly</ins></a> to big tech, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://euobserver.com/digital/arfd2322c4"><ins>as is Ireland in general</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The country offers a low corporate tax rate and tends to be lenient <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/24/ireland-data-privacy-1270123"><ins>when it comes to regulations</ins></a>. The DPC has developed a reputation for not actually calling on big tech companies to pay out fines for violating laws like the EU&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation. As a matter of fact, the organization has only managed to collect around 0.6 percent of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/13/data-regulator-collects-fraction-of-fines-levied/"><ins>billions of dollars in fines</ins></a> <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gdpr-fines-dla-piper-report-144510440.html"><ins>levied toward tech companies</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Some of these violations were attributed to Meta itself. The company was fined nearly $300 million <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/irish-data-protection-commission-fines-meta-eu251-million"><ins>after a data breach</ins></a> impacted Facebook accounts throughout the globe. Meta was <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-fined-102-million-for-storing-passwords-in-plain-text-110049679.html"><ins>fined another $100 million</ins></a> after it was found to be storing passwords in plain text, which is a GDPR violation. Here&#39;s hoping Sweeney is willing to step up against her old bosses.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/a-former-facebook-lobbyist-is-now-in-charge-of-the-eus-facebook-regulator-154444108.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>China is ending its antitrust probe into Google, which had centered around Android’s ubiquity in the mobile world and what impact, if any, it was having on Chinese phone makers like Oppo and Xiaomi that use the software. As reported by the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/069e1e62-748f-43d1-9559-18767ec53a48"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>, this move comes amid ongoing discussions between the US and Chinese governments over <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trumps-tiktok-deal-will-give-control-to-a-group-of-us-investors-report-says-201331190.html"><ins>TikTok</ins></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-bans-tech-companies-from-buying-nvidias-ai-chips-120143740.html"><ins>NVIDIA</ins></a>, tariffs and the broader trading relationship between the world&#39;s two largest economies.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s search engine remains blocked in China, along with many of its other core products like Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps. Despite this, the tech giant still generates substantial revenue in the country through cloud services and ad sales to Chinese companies targeting overseas audiences.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, the decision by Beijing to ease up on Google is a tactical move, as China increasingly flexes its regulatory scrutiny on NVIDIA as a negotiating tool during trade talks with the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer NVIDIA <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-may-give-us-government-a-cut-of-its-profits-to-sell-ai-chips-to-china-120003260.html"><ins>struck a deal</ins></a> with the Trump administration to sell its pared-back H20 GPUs in China on the condition that it gives the US government 15 percent of the sales. Shortly thereafter, however, China began <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html"><ins>discouraging</ins></a> local companies from buying the H20 chips. Recently, the government <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-bans-tech-companies-from-buying-nvidias-ai-chips-120143740.html"><ins>outright banned</ins></a> Chinese tech companies from buying NVIDIA&#39;s newest AI chip made specifically for the region, the RTX Pro 6000D.</p>
<p>In yet another move to exert control and flex power, Chinese regulators have accused NVIDIA of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-says-nvidias-mellanox-acquisition-violated-antitrust-law-200409929.html"><ins>violating Chinese antitrust laws</ins></a> with its acquisition of chipmaker Mellanox. Were the chipmaker to be found in violation of China&#39;s anti-monopoly law, the company could owe fines between 1 percent and 10 percent of its 2024 sales.</p>
<p>US and Chinese officials just wrapped three days of trade talks in Madrid, with President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping set to speak on Friday. The leaders are expected to discuss a supposed framework for a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trumps-tiktok-deal-will-give-control-to-a-group-of-us-investors-report-says-201331190.html"><ins>TikTok deal</ins></a> that would cede control of the company&#39;s US business to American companies, resulting in a roughly 80 percent stake in the entity domestically.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-closes-antitrust-probe-into-googles-android-operating-system-145815140.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve just shelled out thousands of dollars on one of Samsung’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/samsungs-2025-bespoke-appliances-are-going-all-in-on-ai-020018377.html"><ins>smart fridges</ins></a>, you’d be forgiven for expecting it to leave you alone, rather than encouraging you to spend even more money. But that is no longer the case — following a recent update, you’ll start seeing ads on the fridge’s display.</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-confirms-smart-refrigerator-ads-are-coming-3598848/"><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em></a>, the new software update is being rolled out to Samsung’s Family Hub <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c6e05d39-e331-4b2f-8c55-1bd0d4ad0e0b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=refrigerators&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9yZWZyaWdlcmF0b3JzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzZlMDVkMzktZTMzMS00YjJmLThjNTUtMWJkMGQ0YWQwZTBiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9yZWZyaWdlcmF0b3JzLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAV0ubZFUs-698Tx6MNC-2a-BBUDT2-XXO-wk7T4hzJDC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Frefrigerators%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/us/refrigerators/"><ins>refrigerators</ins></a> in the US, and will now display ads and promotions while the display is idle. In a statement to the outlet, Samsung confirmed that it’s conducting a pilot program as part of its commitment to (brace yourselves for this one) &quot;enhancing every day value for our home appliance customers.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Cover Screen on which ads show up appears when a refrigerator is not displaying something else, such as Samsung’s Art Mode or a photo album. Samsung told <em>Android Authority </em>that advertising won’t appear when one of these modes is active, adding that specific ads can also be dismissed and won’t appear again while the campaign is running.</p>
<p>What the statement doesn’t make clear is whether advertising can be turned off altogether, which again, seems like a reasonable option given that you can expect to pay anything between $1,800 and $3,500 for a Family Hub-equipped fridge. But it doesn’t appear to be possible while the pilot period is live. It also isn’t clear if any specific models are omitted from the testing.</p>
<p>Back in April, Samsung’s head of R&amp;D for digital appliances, Jeong Seung Moon, told <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/654685/samsung-screens-everywhere-home-appliances-strategy-interview-exclusive"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> that at that time the company had no plans to bring ads to its smart home displays, but in the case of its refrigerators it appears to have changed its mind pretty quickly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsungs-very-expensive-family-hub-fridges-will-now-treat-you-to-ads-on-their-displays-143529070.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Try as I might, turn-based strategy games don&#39;t usually do it for me. That&#39;s one reason I haven&#39;t yet dipped into <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-an-original-hit-rpg-090012488.html"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, many people&#39;s favorite of the year so far<em>. </em>I&#39;d almost always rather be playing a more action-based game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after trying the demo for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427450/Flick_Shot_Rogues/"><em>Flick Shot Rogues</em></a> on a whim during the most recent Steam Next Fest, the game hasn&#39;t been far from my thoughts. The debut title from Butter By The Fish, a three-person studio in Germany, arrived on Steam this week. Despite the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-should-give-you-a-chance-against-its-early-bosses-134125593.html"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> tugging at my attention, I keep turning back to this pirate-themed, turn-based roguelite.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a bit like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKkpZ5_tfAY">Subbuteo</a> but with crabs, monkeys and lasers. Each level features several enemies on red discs that you have to take out by flicking your character toward them. One hero causes damage when you clatter into enemies, and another will smash every foe within a certain radius after they stop moving. My favorite, the Froggomancer, collects frogs and uses them to attack goons that they slide by or end up next to.</p>
<div id="e37d2cef034b4526a745cd2a3ce0282b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-q0plGoBP_E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>You can take a couple of characters into each run (and swap to the other one before your turn) and equip each with a relic. These include fire damage, lightning attacks and sticky bombs. Many of these have chain effects, so you can use them to attack multiple bad guys in one turn. Since this is a roguelite, you&#39;ll upgrade your abilities as you go. After the first couple of stages, each level has at least one enemy or boss with a yellow disc. Once you take those out, you beat that wave or level.</p>
<p>There are no prizes for guessing that putting together a strong build is a big part of this game. In one run, I tripled up on a trinket that gave me a 50 percent attack boost (so 150 percent extra damage) when I had full shields, making the first shot of each round all the more important.</p>
<p><em>Flick Shot Rogues </em>echoes one of my favorite games of 2023, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397120/subpar_pool/"><em>Subpar Pool</em></a>. I played quite a bit of snooker and pool growing up, and I always enjoyed figuring out the angle and power of my shot — executing it successfully was an entirely different matter. Being able to replicate that here is one reason why I&#39;m digging this game so much.</p>
<p>You can see where your character will end up after hitting a wall or enemy to help you better plan your turn. So, for once in a video game, I&#39;m slowing down and taking more time to actually consider the consequences of my actions before doing anything.</p>
<p>The tactility of slamming my character&#39;s disc into enemies and causing a killer chain reaction helps make <em>Flick Shot Rogues</em> feel more active and engaging to me than many other turn-based games I&#39;ve tried. Each runs can take up to an hour or so, but they don&#39;t feel anything like that long.</p>
<p>I do wish the game did a better job of communicating the enemies&#39; next moves and how their attacks work. It&#39;s not clear to me, for instance, when a yellow-disc enemy is about to teleport to the other side of a level. You&#39;ll often get an indicator of what your foes are about to do, but not every time. That makes it a little more difficult to decide whether to attack, make a defensive move or reposition for a better angle on my next turn.</p>
<p>But still, I keep coming back for more. Launching a barrage of fire-inducing frogs after squeezing through a narrow gap on a bank shot is pretty fun. I&#39;m looking forward to finding out what other characters, relics and enhancements can do.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/flick-shot-rogues-is-the-rare-turn-based-game-that-my-brain-is-gelling-with-133020834.html?src=rss]]></description>
