<p>We&#39;ll tell you how to tune in to the livestream and what else you can expect to see.</p>

<p>Dr. Su will deliver a keynote speech from the Palazzo Ballroom at the Venetian on Monday, January 5 at 9:30PM ET (6:30PM PT).

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-amd-at-ces-2026">What to expect from AMD at CES 2026</h2>
<p>While AMD says it&#39;s keeping its product details under wraps, we <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html">can expect</a> &quot;updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the &quot;advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.&quot; That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever">better single-threaded performance</a> than its predecessors. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding AI, AMD could further discuss its new <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-will-preview-its-redstone-upscaling-tech-on-december-10-174507324.html">FSR Redstone</a> technology, which it previously previewed on December 10. AMD&#39;s upscaling tech aims to close the gap on NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS 4, which was announced during CES 2025.</p>
<p>Su&#39;s presentation caps off CES&#39;s press day, so she&#39;ll be taking the stage in the hours after rivals <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130028668.html">NVIDIA</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-core-ultra-series-3-panther-lake-launch-event-130040881.html">Intel</a> present their chipmaking and AI plans to the world.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waymo is getting a good look at the competition as Uber revealed the design of its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-and-lucids-robotaxis-will-debut-in-the-bay-area-in-2026-120000876.html">robotaxi</a> that&#39;s due to launch in San Francisco later this year. The upcoming robotaxi is a result of a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2025/Lucid-Nuro-and-Uber-Partner-on-Next-Generation-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Program/default.aspx">partnership</a> announced in July between Uber, Lucid and Nuro. The plan is still to deploy at least 20,000 <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ubers-latest-robotaxi-plan-involves-20000-lucid-evs-145943920.html">Lucid EVs</a> that will use the Nuro Driver autonomous driving tech and be available through the Uber platform.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that the robotaxi reveal will be a &quot;production intent design,&quot; so there may be some modifications to the version that will eventually hit the streets. However, the partnership started on-road testing last month in the San Francisco Bay Area, with Nuro using more than 100 robotaxi prototypes supervised by autonomous vehicle operators.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The robotaxi, which is a modified <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-lucid-gravity-is-the-coolest-three-row-ev-on-the-market-120024089.html">Lucid Gravity</a>, will feature a multi-pronged sensor system, including high-res cameras, lidar sensors, and radar. The design also incorporates a halo mounted onto the EV&#39;s roof, which will increase sensor visibility and double as a display that uses LEDs to display helpful info to passengers.</p>
<p>As for the interior, Uber designed the &quot;in-vehicle rider experience,&quot; which can accommodate six passengers and luggage space. Inside, the robotaxi will have a display that lets you activate heated seats, adjust climate controls and throw on music, while also offering options for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-tesla-robotaxi-inexplicably-drove-into-a-parked-car-171004400.html">emergencies</a>, like contacting support or requesting the robotaxi to pull over. Even though the passenger isn&#39;t behind the wheel, the robotaxi&#39;s interactive screen will show its planned path in real-time and all the decisions it makes while driving, like interacting with pedestrians, traffic lights or lane changes.</p>
<p>The partnership said the design is still awaiting final validation, but that the robotaxi production is slated to start at Lucid&#39;s factory in Arizona later this year. Before its official launch in late 2026, Uber&#39;s robotaxi will be on display at CES 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-reveals-the-design-of-its-robotaxi-at-ces-2026-230056302.html?src=rss]]></description>

This computer is filled with both bells and whistles, making it a decent choice for modern gamers.</p>
<p>To that end, the laptop can be equipped with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H processor. This is Intel&#39;s upcoming flagship mobile processor that has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109046/intel-core-ultra-9-386h-panther-lake-cpu-loses-to-amds-flagship-strix-halo-apu-in-geekbench/index.html"><ins>previously been known as Panther Lake</ins></a>.

<p>It comes with a 16-inch WQXGA OLED display that offers true HDR imaging support. The laptop can be loaded with up to 64GB of RAM and up to 2TB of storage. The connectivity here is on point, with support for Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth. Everything is housed in an 18.9mm slim metal chassis. It looks pretty solid.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have any pricing, and the company might still be calculating that, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://mashable.com/article/framework-price-hike-ddr5-ram-memory-shortage">given that ongoing RAM shortage</a>.

The company says it’s focused on what matters and on what you, hopefully, want in your next laptop. That means Intel’s latest chips, a cleaner design and battery life that lasts longer than a day. They’re really thin, too.</p>
<p>Timed alongside Intel’s CES announcements, the whole Galaxy Book 6 series features new Panther Lake chips, optimized by Samsung for three new laptops: The Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book 6 Ultra can be equipped with up to Core Ultra X9 processors and promises significant performance improvements, with a new 5th-generation MPU, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA’s RTX 50 series GPUs (with RTX 5070 and 5060 options). That package leads Samsung to promise up to 1.6x greater CPU power and 1.7x improved graphics performance compared to the last Galaxy Book series. (It’s worth noting that Samsung skipped an Ultra configuration of the Galaxy Book 5 series.)</p>
<p>All the laptops feature improved heat-management architecture, with a wider vapor chamber and re-engineered fans. At the same time, the Ultra features a new dual-path fan to cool the GPU even more efficiently and swiftly.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Book 6 Pro will come in 14- and 16-inch versions, with up to Core Ultra X7 processors and Intel Arc graphics. Both the Book 6 Ultra and Pro have improved AMOLED 2X (2,880 x 1,800) displays with touch, reaching up to 1000 nits of peak brightness — twice the brightness of the Book 5 Pro. Both models support adaptive refresh rates too, going up to 120Hz.</p>
<p>The Book 6 Ultra has a more typical laptop shape, while the Book 6 Pro has a teardrop profile, made famous by the MacBook Air.  Even if there’s some Apple inspiration, the Samsung laptops look great. Samsung has removed many unnecessary design elements. Although the Book 6 Ultra clings onto a USB-A port, it now (finally) has a full-size SD card reader, the lack of which was a major oversight on previous laptops.</p>

<p>Samsung has also tweaked the keyboard layout, though it’s too early to say whether it offers a significant improvement to the typing experience. It has added haptic trackpads to the Galaxy Book series for the first time too, although I found the one on my demo unit a little too hair-trigger sensitive to my touch. Thankfully, that’s something that can be addressed in the settings.</p>
<p>As you might notice from the photos, there are upward-firing speakers on either side of the keyboard. The Book 6 Ultra has six built-in speakers (four woofers, two tweeters) and has apparently balanced them symmetrically to reduce noise distortion.</p>
<p>Both laptops are slimmer than their predecessors, too. The Galaxy Book 6 Ultra is 15.4mm thick, while the Book 6 Pro is a svelte 11.9mm. Inside, Samsung has also enhanced heat management, including a wider vapour chamber and re-engineered fans, to ensure optimal performance during intensive tasks – apparently another priority for the Book 6 Series. Likewise, battery enclosures and placements have been re-engineered, and Samsung claims the new Book 6 Ultra and Pro can each deliver up to 30 hours of video playback. The Book 6 Ultra has the extra benefit of faster charging, reaching 63% in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a laptop launch in 2026 without AI features. Alongside the Book 6 series, Samsung highlighted a tool that uses AI to help create cut-outs of images for copy-and-pasting across devices, as well as a Note Assist feature to help collate and summarize your notes.</p>
<p>As is often the case at CES, Samsung hasn’t yet shared pricing or release dates for the Galaxy Book 6 series, so expect to hear more in the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MSI has presented its refreshed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-msi-prestige-ps42-business-laptop.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Prestige</a> lineup of business laptops, as well as its next-generation Raider, Stealth and Crosshair gaming models at this year’s CES. The Raider 16 Max HX is a 300w laptop, which the company says its its most powerful gaming model yet. It can supply 175w to its GeForce RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 GPU, while feeding 125w to its Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor at the same time under full-load conditions. To be able to handle that kind of power, MSI equipped it with a new cooling system consisting of three fans, six heat pipes, five exhaust vents and phase-change thermal compound. The Raider 16 Max also has a quick-access bottom panel that gives users an easy way to upgrade their storage and memory. </p><p>Meanwhile, the new Stealth 16 AI+ laptop’s selling point seems to be its portability. It’s just 16.6mm thin, weighs under two kilograms, comes equipped with RTX 50 series GPU and has dual memory and SSD slots. MSI has also introduced the new Crosshair 16 Max HX and Crosshair 16 HX laptops powered by Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs at the event. Buyers can pay extra for an optional QHD+ 165Hz OLED display if they want sharper visuals, as well. </p><p>In addition to its new gaming laptops, MSI has introduced its all-new Prestige 14 and Prestige 16 business laptops at CES. They’re slimmer with a more rounded silhouette compared to their predecessors, and they’re encased in full aluminum. The laptops are powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors and are equipped with an 81Wh battery that can offer over 30 hours of video playback in 1080p. MSI has debuted the new Modern 14S and 16S series powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors for everyday users, as well. Plus, the company has unveiled a Glacier Blue edition of its handheld gaming console, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/msis-new-claw-gaming-handhelds-have-lunar-lake-processors-and-nondescript-ai-powers-230028563.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Claw</a> 8AI+, that’s powered by the Intel Core Ultra 200V processor with Arc Xe2 graphics. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year HP is making an important change by taking its name off its gaming hardware entirely and letting its HyperX branding take center stage. At CES 2026, the company is celebrating this transition in a big way with Omen Max 16, which is being heralded as the world’s most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling.</p><p>Now the last part of that claim is a bit of a cop out, but considering that most gamers probably don’t want to lug around a notebook with hoses coming out the back, it’s an understandable qualifier. Plus, with a total platform power of 300 watts that includes support for the latest chips from Intel and AMD and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, this thing certainly won’t be lacking in speed. Under the hood, the Max 16 features a third cooling fan to prevent throttling under sustained workloads along with HP’s Fan Cleaner tech that reverses the direction of the laptop’s fans to prevent dust from building up inside.&nbsp;</p><p>As for its design, the Max 16 doesn’t stray too far from HyperX’s signature matte black color scheme, though I do appreciate that the company kept a handful of accents  like the RGB lightbar mounted on the laptop’s front lip. The notebook also features a per-key RGB backlit keyboard with a 1,000Hz polling rate, which should all but eliminate any issues with ghosting or rollover during hectic facerolling sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one quirk about the system I noticed when checking it out first hand is that even with above average brightness of 500 nits for its 2.5K OLED display, the screen also comes with an unusually glossy coating. The benefit of this is that colors appear super saturated. The downside is that especially in well-lit rooms with a lot of sunlight, there’s more glare and reflections than you might expect.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="d14e3a31-a7fc-4c97-abc2-119730bc135f"/><p>Another nice improvement about the Max 16 that might go unnoticed if you only look at its spec sheet is that despite having a TPP of 300 watts, its power brick is relatively compact. It wasn’t all that long ago that a laptop with this kind of performance might have required dual power cables in order to supply the notebook with the amount of juice it needs. That said, weighing between 6.1 and 6.5 pounds depending on the exact configuration, the Max 16 still isn’t the kind of laptop you’re going to want to carry around on a frequent basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, if you’re in the market for what is essentially an old-school desktop replacement laptop without moving up to even larger 18-inch machines, HyperX’s latest flagship gaming laptop should be a strong contender that won’t be lacking in speed.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Max-16-lid.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Max-16-lid.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="One change for 2026 is that HP is taking its name off of its gaming systems and letting the HyperX brand take center stage.

However, we should know more when it becomes available sometime later this spring. And finally, if you’re looking for something slightly smaller or a more affordable system (we don&#39;t have official pricing, but the Max 16 won&#39;t come cheap), HP is also updating the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4dec7c65-7950-497a-ac88-81181759bb39&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP+Store&amp;linkText=Omen+15&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ocC5jb20vdXMtZW4vc2hvcC9kbHAvaHAtb21lbi0xNS1sYXB0b3AiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRkZWM3YzY1LTc5NTAtNDk3YS1hYzg4LTgxMTgxNzU5YmIzOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHAuY29tL3VzLWVuL3Nob3AvZGxwL2hwLW9tZW4tMTUtbGFwdG9wIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdu9Dg7BcHo-2--kBMmaPcMeieN49axAhDk-wOZMgraw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fdlp%2Fhp-omen-15-laptop" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP Store;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/dlp/hp-omen-15-laptop">Omen 15</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4dec7c65-7950-497a-ac88-81181759bb39&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP+Store&amp;linkText=Omen+16&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ocC5jb20vdXMtZW4vZ2FtaW5nLXBjL2xhcHRvcHMvMjAyMy1vbWVuLTE2LWludGVsLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRkZWM3YzY1LTc5NTAtNDk3YS1hYzg4LTgxMTgxNzU5YmIzOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHAuY29tL3VzLWVuL2dhbWluZy1wYy9sYXB0b3BzLzIwMjMtb21lbi0xNi1pbnRlbC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYoFZ7yPzhl_BQQUnoaaOsDlHsdt65iNUdPCcN7sQkUi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fgaming-pc%2Flaptops%2F2023-omen-16-intel.html" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP Store;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.hp.com/us-en/gaming-pc/laptops/2023-omen-16-intel.html">Omen 16</a> with fresh components and new HyperX branding for 2026 as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-hp-says-the-hyperx-omen-max-16-is-the-most-powerful-16-inch-gaming-laptop-in-the-world-230000272.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jensen Huang took to the CES stage on Monday to share the latest from NVIDIA,  and while the presentation was more a refresher of technologies the company has been working on for the past few years, there were a couple of notable announcements. </p><p>NVIDIA announced  Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece of the release is Alpamayo 1 , a 10-billion parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says is capable of approaching driving more like a human being would. The model works by breaking down unexpected driving situations into a smaller set of problems before finding the safest  path forward. At each step of the way, the model can explain its reasoning. </p><p>A sister model named AlpaSim allows developers to do closed-loop training for driving scenarios that are rarely encountered in real life. Huang said the 2025 Mercedes Benz CLA will be the first vehicle to ship with NVIDIA’s entire AV stack, including Alpamayo. &quot;Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,&quot; Huang said. </p><p>Following the Alpamayo announcements,  a pair of BD-1 droids from <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </em>joined Huang on stage. We saw one join the executive at last year’s CES. After that, Huang turned to Vera Rubin. NVIDIA <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_(microarchitecture)" data-i13n="slk:first announced the GPU architecture in 2024;cpos:1;pos:1">first announced the GPU architecture in 2024</a>, and now the company has begun production on a super computer that makes use of the new tech. One Vera CPU has 88 custom Olympus cores and 1.5TB of system memory for a total of 227 billion transistors. Meanwhile, one Rubin GPU features 336 billion transistors. Each Vera Rubin supercomputer has a pair of both components.   </p><p>For those hoping for some gaming-related announcements, Huang didn’t have anything to say about NVIDIA’s consumer GPUs, but we may get something later during CES. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html?src=rss]]></description>

On one hand it felt like the natural evolution of bi-fold phones like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Z Fold 7</a>. But on the other, all this fancy tech comes with an even higher price — around $2,500 based on current conversion rates from Korean won — not to mention the added bulk you get from a third folding panel. So even as someone who has used a foldable as my daily driver for almost a decade straight, it felt like Samsung’s latest high-end phone was going backwards in terms of both portability and affordability. But then at CES 2026, I got a chance to go hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold and all of my concerns pretty much instantly disappeared because with this thing, flexing is believing.</p><p>My initial consternation comes in large part from using the Z Fold 7, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/foldable-phone-makers-have-solved-every-issue-except-one-130000891.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">hit a major milestone this year thanks</a> to a revamped design that doesn’t come with any added size or weight even when compared to comparable candybar-style phones like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-too-much-ai-not-enough-ultra-140022798.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. That’s a major breakthrough considering how hefty and chunky the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-14-samsung-galaxy-fold-redesign-review-durability-screen.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">original Galaxy Fold</a> was back in 2019. And when you compare the Z Fold 7’s dimensions (7.58 ounces and 8.9mm thick when folded) to the new TriFold (10.9 ounces and 12.9mm when folded), there’s no doubt that Samsung’s new flagship foldable comes with a lot of extra bulk. To put things into context, we have to go back several generations to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-5-review-five-years-in-samsung-is-treading-water-140002461.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Z Fold 5</a> just to find a comparable phone with similar thickness (13.4mm). And even then, that handset is still significantly lighter than the TriFold at 8.92 ounces.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-thickness.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-thickness.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="There&#39;s simply no denying that the Z TriFold (left) is a much bulkier device than the Z Fold 7 (right). " data-uuid="0436edc2-2210-4ce3-b714-3643112973bc"/><figcaption>There&#39;s simply no denying that the Z TriFold (left) is a much bulkier device than the Z Fold 7 (right). </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>But then I opened it up and my concerns were quickly pushed aside because suddenly you’re greeted with 10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness. As a phone that can pull double duty as a tablet, the jump up from the Z Fold 7’s 8-inch main display cannot be understated. Not only does it make multitasking so much easier, when combined with Samsung’s DeX desktop mode, you basically get a miniature laptop experience from a device that fits in a pocket. Especially if you don’t mind carrying around a travel-friendly mouse and keyboard. Plus, you can connect the TriFold to an external display (either wired or wirelessly) to access even more screen space. Way more than with the Z Fold 7, I can honestly see myself leaving my PC at home and using the TriFold as my primary work device.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important but easily overlooked upgrade on the Galaxy Z Trifold is the 4:3 aspect ratio for its 10-inch main display. Compared to the Z Fold 7 and its almost perfectly square screen, you just get so much extra room on the sides for widescreen movies and shows. I tested this out by watching the trailer for Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Odyssey</em>, and even though that movie uses a super wide aspect ratio due to being filmed entirely on IMAX cameras, the viewing experience was just so much better. Peak watchability is something the regular Z Fold line has sort of left by the wayside as the company moved to larger exterior displays, which resulted in the series’ primary screen becoming more square. The one downside though is that the TriFold may make you more of a resolution snob, as it’s a lot easier to tell the difference between 1080p and 2K or 4K on a larger 10-inch panel.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="8ace2500-60c9-402d-824d-64866eb5f9cd"/><p>The final pillar of the TriFold’s kit is all the engineering that Samsung put into making it easy to open and close. Simply moving from one hinge to two while adding a third folding panel undersells the complexity of its design. Samsung actually uses two different types of magnets that push or pull depending on where they are, which makes accessing the TriFold’s primary display practically just as easy as on the Z Fold 7. That’s no small feat. Opening and shutting this thing is just so satisfying on a tactile level, and that’s before you consider that there’s basically no downgrade in terms of image quality.&nbsp;</p><p>While there’s only one way to unfurl the TriFold, which might seem confusing at first, Samsung addressed that too by throwing up a warning and making the whole phone vibrate if you try to do it wrong. And then there are components like the glass-reinforced carbon panels Samsung uses to add strength and durability to its chassis while keeping it as thin as possible. The one potential concern in the future is that unlike Samsung’s older foldables, there’s not as much room for improvement to shrink its dimensions much further, as the TriFold’s slimness is currently limited by the size of its USB-C jack. So if the next model wants to make big gains there, it may need to go completely portless.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Z-Fold-TriFold-movie-watching.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Z-Fold-TriFold-movie-watching.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Here&#39;s what The Odyssey trailer looks like on the Z TriFold (right) compared to the Z Fold 7 (left).

It&#39;s such a better experience. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>On a certain level, I kind of hate how much I like the Galaxy Z TriFold. I really don’t want to go back to bigger, heavier phones that are even more bulky <em>and</em> expensive than the Z Fold 7. But the appeal is impossible to deny and for people who love a good multitasker, I can easily see how these tradeoffs are worth the upside of Samsung’s latest apex foldable.&nbsp;</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is currently on sale in South Korea, though we’re still waiting for official pricing and availability for the US and North American market.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I met up with a few people from Google at the Encore Villas <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-las-vegas-153146838.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABXCoIiT7WZOIxDxH-DQgZmdjVANBM7hcMi5214CK4PHcMhkCfyyZDDW-fRTcWmBUhG7IsyyYJl9WYSGZD1njXMVci3tfqkCLz_TkMtBbpUeoQDLlpOYG9uhyppHOlYl2HDsUZvl884yE2-pBFdXHM7cPSjLNFgAVP-bu9R4kdTj" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">during CES</a> (which is just 2,500 feet from my hotel but took 28 minutes to walk to, thanks to Vegas’s pedestrian-averse design [also I got lost]). Once there, I saw what “<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">more Gemini</a>” will mean for people with a Google TV. </p><p>The AI integration ranged from useful to probably unnecessary. The most useful bit, for me at least, came at the end. It’s admittedly a boring, but now you an adjust your TV’s settings just by talking. In the demo, Salahuddin Choudhary, Google’s Gemini for Android product lead said, “Can you boost the dialogue?” and Gemini changed the mode accordingly, without leaving the golf game he was watching. I asked if it could turn off motion smoothing, the first thing I adjust on a new TV (and sometimes other people’s). Yes, it can. </p><p>The “deep dive” Gemini feature could prove fairly useful, too. With it, asking for general information turns into a mini lesson on the subject, complete with generated images and narration. When Choudhary asked Gemini to “explain the Northern Lights to [his] eighth grader,” the screen filled with the standard Gemini answer: a brief definition and images and video tiles for further exploration. But a small Dive deeper button on the screen led to a narrated and illustrated tour of the science behind the phenomenon. My kid is at the age where he asks me questions I can’t answer about the fundamental makeup of the universe — maybe this could help.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google_tv_northern_lights_lesson.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google_tv_northern_lights_lesson.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The Google TV demo at CES showed an answer on the science behind how the northern lights are created " data-uuid="ad793028-3ace-46ef-be97-c1a70672c0fb"/><figcaption>The Google TV demo at CES showed an answer on the science behind how the northern lights are created </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Google Photos is getting a much deeper integration with Google TVs, too. Choudhary asked for pics from a trip to the beach and snapshots of happy people amongst the sea and sand popped up on the screen. One particular shot would make a nice screen saver, I was told, and he asked Gemini to give the photo an oil painting makeover using the Remix feature. </p><p>However, if you want your photo recast in a way not offered with Remix, you can use Nano Banana. Choudhary turned one of the personal photos into a cartoon just by asking. Using Veo turned the same image into an short (if slightly glitchy) animation of a person playing fetch with the dog in the photo.  </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Google_tv_demo_with_neo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Google_tv_demo_with_neo.jpg" style="height:1490px;width:2650px;" alt="Google TV used Neo to recast a picture as a cartoon." data-uuid="9082057f-3eda-4415-bc83-d1539b2b12c9"/><figcaption>Google TV used Neo to recast a picture as a cartoon.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Your ability to generate video will depend on your Gemini subscription tier, but I was told a purchase of a Google TV device would include most of the other AI capabilities that I saw demonstrated. </p><p>I’d classify the photo manipulation and video generation as decidedly less useful that the other features, but my kid would probably get a kick out of messing with them for a while. For people who use Gemini a lot, being able to do so on the biggest screen in the house may appeal. Ditto for those who like seeing your Google Photos in a giant format. Some folks will appreciate the AI image manipulation and generation, I’m sure, but I’m mostly excited about the admittedly boring part of not having to leave a show to boost the brightness of a scene. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tvs-new-gemini-features-range-from-useful-to-unnecessary-222900001.html?src=rss]]></description>

The post includes a series of striking claims about the unnamed food delivery company, like that its &quot;Priority Delivery&quot; option doesn&#39;t actually change delivery speeds, that it sorts delivery drivers based on their level of desperation and that it steals tips from drivers.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>TCL introduced the next entry in its flagship line of televisions during CES. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcl-unveils-x11l-series-sqd-mini-led-tv-at-ces-2026-delivering-ultimate-performance-with-an-all-new-level-of-accurate-color-302652292.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">X11L SQD-Mini LED Series</a> is available for pre-order now in three sizes. But like much of the gear on show in Las Vegas this week, it doesn&#39;t come cheap. The 75-inch model of the X11L costs $7,000, the 85-inch option is $8,000 and the 98-inch model goes for $10,000.&nbsp;That’s more than double the costs of the QD-Mini LED TV the brand <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/tcls-new-mini-led-tvs-aim-for-oleds-throne-again-190023765.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">unveiled</a> at last year’s CES. </p><p>The most notable addition in TCL&#39;s latest screen is the company&#39;s new Deep Color System. This tech leverages Super Quantum Dots, combined with its CSOT UltraColor Filter, and the Advanced Color Purity Algorithm. While a mini LED screen can&#39;t match the true blacks of an OLED, the X11L has TCL&#39;s Halo Control System to reduce the presence of bloom. The television also has 20,000 discrete dimming zones and boasts peak brightness of 10,000 nits.&nbsp;</p><p>Well-known brand Bang &amp; Olufsen continues to be responsible for the TV&#39;s audio system. The models use an upgraded AI processor to deliver enhanced color, contrast, clarity, motion, upscaling and sound. It&#39;s also integrated with Gemini for Google TV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/tcl-unveils-its-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tvs-at-ces-2026-205532386.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>CES has long felt like a full-on auto show, but the car-centric energy seems somewhat muted at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">CES 2026</a>.

<p>That includes Hyundai. While the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-mobis-to-unveil-30-new-technologies-at-ces-2026-aiming-to-strengthen-global-oem-partnerships-302635135.html">Mobis subsidiary</a> will present &quot;more than 30 mobility convergence technologies&quot; during CES week — including its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2026/holographic-windshield-display/">Holographic Windshield Display</a> — we&#39;re hearing the Korean auto giant will instead use its press conference to focus on its <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001093">AI Robotics Strategy</a>. That will apparently include showcasing its new Atlas robot, as well as the wheeled MobED robot line. We&#39;ll get into the details below, along with how to watch it today.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-hyundais-presentation-at-ces-2026">How to watch Hyundai&#39;s presentation at CES 2026</h2>
<p>Hyundai&#39;s presentation takes place today, January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@hyundai/streams">HyundaiUSA YouTube channel</a> or its <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HyundaiMotorGroup">global YouTube channel</a>. (We&#39;ve embedded the link below.)</p>

<p id="jump-link-what-to-expect">We&#39;ll also post relevant news from the Hyundai presser in our main <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-las-vegas-153146838.html">CES 2026 liveblog</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-hyundai-at-ces-2026">What to expect from Hyundai at CES 2026</h2>
<p>Hyundai is putting a huge focus on its <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.hyundainews.com/releases/4658">AI Robotics Strategy</a> during its presentation today — the theme is &quot;Partnering Human Progress.&quot; That&#39;ll include its strategies for commercializing AI-enhanced robotics, keeping with the very AI-centric focus of this year&#39;s CES.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-acquires-boston-dynamics-1-1-billion-110901223.html">purchased by the Korean multinational</a> back in 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,&quot; the company said in the same press release.</p>
<p>But Atlas isn&#39;t the only robot the company has up its sleeve. There&#39;s also the <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001097">MobED Droid</a>, a wheeled &#39;bot that scored a CES 2026 Innovation Award as the show opened this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While on stage, Hyundai says it will &quot;reveal its strategic AI Robotics learning, training and expansion plans,&quot; via its Group Value Network and Software-Defined Factory approach. That includes a manufacturing strategy and an advanced smart factory.</p>
<p>We originally thought Hyundai would showcase its <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2026/holographic-windshield-display/">Holographic Windshield Display</a> during its press conference, but a Hyundai representative notified us it won&#39;t be featured today. It will have a separate CES presence, though not a separate press conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update, January 5 2026, 2:58PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated to include information on the MobED robot line, and to note that the Holographic Windshield Display likely won&#39;t be featured at the press conference.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-press-conference-live-190051823.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Why is the world&#39;s most valuable company reportedly bringing back such an antiquated graphics card? You know the answer. It&#39;s the endless gaping maw known as AI. Tech companies have been hoovering up PC parts for AI applications with reckless abandon. It has become a legitimate challenge for a regular person to buy RAM and graphics cards, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html">which has led</a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">price increases across the board</a> and companies like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html">Crucial closing up shop</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s particularly difficult to get ahold of GDDR7 RAM, which is needed for the newer RTX 5060 cards. So NVIDIA&#39;s solution looks to be a hop in the time machine to 2021. Gamers will need something, after all, and the 3060 technically gets the job done. Any downgrade in graphics and performance will be worth it once you watch an AI-generated video of Kurt Cobain singing in heaven with Albert Einstein, am I right? It&#39;s hilarious because they never got to meet in real life.</p>
<p>The RTX 3060 <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">is still pretty popular</a>, despite NVIDIA <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/joao-silva/nvidia-will-reportedly-discontinue-the-geforce-rtx-3060/">phasing out the card back in 2024</a>. We don&#39;t know how much the company plans on charging for this trip down memory lane. The GPU originally cost around $329.</p>
<p>One would think that five-year-old technology could easily hit a much lower price point, but NVIDIA has us in a chokehold here and it can pretty much charge whatever it wants. Again, no price is too high when considering the magical wonders of generative AI. You can watch Tupac hang out with Mr. Rogers for five seconds.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-reportedly-bringing-back-2021s-rtx-3060-gpu-because-ai-is-eating-all-of-the-newer-cards-194241706.html?src=rss]]></description>

That's because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung has already held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. Presentations from NVIDIA, Sony, Lego, Hyundai and others are yet to come.</p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos that are being shown off at the event) right here.

Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;</p><p>We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>.

This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes.

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in.

L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation "effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F."

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dolby introduced its FlexConnect technology <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a few years ago</a>, vowing that it would allow customers to position soundbars and speakers anywhere in a room. The company said the platform would then reconfigure the sound automatically, taking into account any locations that may be further away from the center sweet spot. At CES 2026, LG is the first to put Dolby Atmos FlexConnect in a soundbar, offering the so-called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Sound Suite</a> that also includes satellite speaker options and a subwoofer. You don’t need every member of the lineup to use Dolby’s tech, so you can pick and choose which items work best for your living room.&nbsp;</p><p>The centerpiece of the Sound Suite is the H7 soundbar. This 9.1.6-channel speaker is configured for spatial audio (Dolby Atmos) and supports lossless audio up to 24 bit/96kHz. The standout on the spec sheet for me is the six up-firing channels, which should enhance the sensation of overhead sounds. Most of the soundbars I review have only two of those.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the H7 is equipped with a feature called Sound Follow that tracks the location of your phone to reconfigure the audio when your position changes. Maybe you move to a comfy chair instead of the sofa right in front of the TV. The idea is that you don’t have to suffer through subpar audio during a movie or show just because you aren’t in the best spot.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lg-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lg-2.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="LG Sound Suite H7 soundbar" data-uuid="fc481d92-5ba0-47fb-b7c5-4742d3a41e5b"/><figcaption>LG Sound Suite H7 soundbar</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Then there are the M5 and M7 speakers. When used with the H7 soundbar, these are the satellite speakers, but LG cautioned me against calling them “rear” units. While it’s true a pair of them will be positioned behind most people’s sofas, the company explained that there’s more audio content coming out of them than traditional rear channels provide. As such, two of the M5s or M7s that are used to complement the speakers inside one of LG’s impressively thin TVs are doing more work than just beaming sounds that are designed to come from behind.&nbsp;</p><p>The M5 is a 1.1.1-channel speaker while the M7 is 2.1.1. Like the H7, both support Dolby Atmos and lossless music. What’s more, the entire Sound Suite arsenal has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, including AirPlay 2, Google Cast and both Spotify and Tidal connect. The whole shebang also employs LG’s own AI Sound Pro and Room Calibration Pro, and all of the settings are customized in the ThinQ app for Android and iOS.&nbsp;</p><p>Each speaker can be used independently should the need arise, and as I already mentioned, you can pick and choose which components will work best for you — up to four total speakers. So you can opt for the H7, sub and two speakers or four of either the M5 or M7. You can also get a smaller setup with two speakers or just the soundbar and subwoofer. Dolby Atmos FlexConnect is still in play no matter what combination you decide on. I should note the optional W7 subwoofer is quite large, but you can use it standing upright or laying flat, according to LG.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lg-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lg-1.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="LG Sound Suite M5 speaker" data-uuid="bd8381a8-356c-48f8-9d21-dd7c9db4f0f4"/><figcaption>LG Sound Suite M5 speaker</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, none of this means anything if Sound Suite doesn’t actually sound good. I’m happy to report LG’s collection of speakers are sonically impressive. I was able to get a good sense of how they’ll perform in a quite demo room at CES. Watching a variety of movie clips in Dolby Atmos, I flipped back and forth between a setup with four M7 speakers and a more robust configuration of the soundbar, subwoofer and M7 speakers. While I preferred the overall tone and tuning of the four M7s, I can concede the bigger collection offered more immersive sound and better directional audio. That said, they both provided excellent clarity and pristine detail. </p><p>With Sound Follow, you can quickly have Sound Suite reconfigure the audio based on the location of your phone with just a tap. Let’s say you move from the couch to a comfy chair and want to adjust the sound to that spot. You can do that in the app. And while I could tell a slight difference in a side-of-the-room location and the center sweet spot in front of the TV, the correction did offer an improvement over the unadjusted audio.</p><p>I was also able to test standalone mode, where you can quickly use any Sound Suite speaker individually for music. Sound quality was consistent here too, and the system allowed me to add a second M7 speaker for a stereo pair with a few taps in LG’s app. Overall, the Sound Suite lineup offers lots of flexibility in terms of features and configurations. In fact, LG says that between the H7, W7, M5 and M7, there are 50 possible combinations. </p><p>Unfortunately, LG hasn’t announced pricing or availability yet. Given the capabilities of the Sound Suite system, I don’t expect the more robust collections to come cheap. However, I do think the company will offer a few different bundles that will hopefully provide a discount over buying each component individually. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-sound-suite-hands-on-at-ces-2026-home-theater-powered-by-dolby-atmos-flexconnect-192709499.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p>
<p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html" data-i13n="slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;cpos:3;pos:1">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward. </p>

<h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2>
<p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p>
<p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p>
<p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p>

The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p>
<p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2>
<p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;cpos:6;pos:1">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p>
<p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p>
<p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2>
<p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p>
<p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2>
<p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p>
<p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p>
<p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p>
<p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p>

Meet the Lego Smart Brick, a standard-sized 2 x 4 brick that’s packed with modern technology to enable sets that can respond to how they’re played with or the sets you build. It’s part of a <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6354879d-871a-4410-855d-b4db770893fe&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=new+initiative+called+Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2MzU0ODc5ZC04NzFhLTQ0MTAtODU1ZC1iNGRiNzcwODkzZmUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfP_aTDlIXUJrcSpv8DAU4bDzX0WVIU1j63Uxwwc1HbZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">new initiative called Smart Play</a>, which encompasses the Smart Brick as well as Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags. While we obviously don’t know yet how Lego fans will take to this new system, it’s still fair to say it’s the biggest move Lego has every made to infuse its products with connected technology.</p>
<p>The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside of it that Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It runs something called the Play Engine that can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields. Thanks to this and some integrated copper coils, the Smart Brick can sense distance, direction and orientation of other Smart Bricks near it when you’re building. The brick also has a tiny built-in speaker, an accelerometer and an LED array. Lego says the speaker can produce audio that is “tied to live play actions” rather than just playing pre-recorded clips. </p>
<p>The Smart Tag and Smart Minifigures are a lot simpler. The Tag is a 2 x 2 studless tile with a digital ID embedded in it that the Smart Brick can read via “near-field magnetic communication.” This obviously sounds a lot like NFC, but we can’t be sure that these new Lego pieces will be able to communicate with any other NFC devices. Similarly, the Smart Minifigure also has a digital ID readable by NFC. </p>
<p>The purpose of the Smart Tag as well as the similar tech in a Smart Minifigure is to let the Smart Brick know what kind of context it is being used in. As Lego puts it, “The role of the Smart Tag is to tell the Smart Brick how it should play back with you.” The Tag tells the Brick what kind of object, animal, vehicle and so forth it should become. A Smart Tag in a Lego Star Wars X-Wing set, for example, will contain the unique ID and instructions for how the Smart Brick should behave.</p>
<p>If this isn’t enough, Lego has also built a local wireless layer that connects this all together called BrickNet. It’s based on Bluetooth and uses Lego’s proprietary “Neighbor Position Measurement" system, which is what lets the Smart Bricks know how close they are to each other and how they’re oriented. Lego says that this lets the bricks “talk” to each other directly without the need for apps, internet connections or external controls. It sounds like the idea is all three of these new Smart pieces can communicate and interact without any need for setup, which should make it refreshingly like a traditional Lego set.</p>
<p>That said, these bricks naturally will need some power. Lego says that their batteries should still perform even after “years” of inactivity, and the coils and power system is designed so that multiple bricks can be charged wirelessly on a shared charging pad.</p>

<p>Speaking of sets, Lego is unsurprisingly launching the Smart Play system with its biggest licensed partner: Star Wars. There will be three “all-in-one” Star Wars sets available, all of which are on the smaller side and definitely geared towards kids, rather than the 1,000 piece and up sets that the company has released to get adults (like me) interested.</p>
<p>The prices are inflated compared to non-smart sets, but not outrageously so. Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter is a 473-piece set with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, priced at $70. Luke’s Red Five X-Wing is a 584-piece set with two Smart Minifigures, one Smart Brick and five Smart Tags, priced at $100. The Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing is a 962-piece set with three Smart Minifigures, two Smart Bricks and five Smart Tags, priced at a slightly shocking $160. </p>
<p>It’s an entirely new direction for Lego, and you won’t have to wait long to check it out. The company is putting those three sets up for pre-order on January 9, and they’ll launch on March 1. There’s obviously a lot of technology here that’s entirely new to Lego, and as such it’s hard to imagine just how this will all look when it comes together — but we’re hoping that Lego will have some sets on hand here at CES so we can get a closer look at how the Smart Play system works.</p>

That is not likely to be the case this year, though — it’s the hot new “luxury” display technology and is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">all over the place</a> at <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">CES 2026</a>. So why do we even need these new TVs and how are they different from OLED, Micro LED and Mini LED models? Here’s how it works and how it compares.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-a-brief-history-of-flat-panel-display-tech">A brief history of flat panel display tech</h2>
<p>To better understand Micro RGB, it helps to see how flat panel display technology has evolved over the last 20 years. The first LCD TVs used liquid crystals that become transparent to light when voltage is applied, letting a rear backlight shine through as a pixel. Those pixels combine to create moving or still images, with color created via an RGB filter layer placed in front.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The main problem is that LCD crystals let some light partially leak through, so blacks are dark grey instead of pure black. And for a backlight, early LCD TVs used a white screen lit by dim and power-hungry fluorescent lights, which caused uneven light distribution. And finally, the RGB filter color layer reduced a panel’s brightness.</p>
<p>The next step up, then, was to use LED backlights instead, placed at first at the edges of the white screen and then later directly behind it (the first TV with this tech was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2004-08-19-sonys-10-000-qualia-tv.html">Sony’s 2004 Qualia</a>). That added the benefits of higher brightness, lower power consumption, improved color balance and even light distribution. It also allowed individual dimming zones that improve contrast by allowing near-pure blacks in shadow areas of an image.</p>

<p>Quantum dot (QD) technology came on the scene around 2013 with Sony’s Triluminos televisions. This type of LCD panel employs a semiconductor nanocrystal layer (rather than an RGB filter layer) that can produce pure monochromatic red, green, and blue light when struck with a blue backlight. Unlike previous LCDs, they offer higher brightness and color accuracy thanks to the purity (narrowness) of the base RGB colors. The best-known TVs using this tech are Samsung’s QLED models.</p>
<p>The latest evolution of QD LED technology is Mini LED. That combines the accuracy of quantum dot tech with hundreds or even thousands of LED dimming zones. Those models offer high brightness and color accuracy along with good contrast, but still don’t deliver perfect blacks and can display “blooming” in scenes with bright points of light due to leakage into neighboring pixels.</p>
<p>Both of those problems were solved with OLED technology, which first came on the market in 2007 with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-12-01-sony-xel-1-oled-tv-unboxed.html">Sony’s XEL-1 model</a>. The panels are made using sheets coated with organic LEDs, each paired with a transistor that can switch the LED on or off. On regular OLED TVs, OLED pixels are white and a filter layer generates colors, much as with LED TVs. However, with QD-OLEDs, OLED pixels are blue and color is created via a quantum dot layer, like LED QD displays. The latest version of QD-OLED featured on<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html"> several new monitors at CES 2026</a> (Samsung’s 5th-gen QD-OLED) uses an RGB stripe pattern to reduce color “fringing” on text.</p>
<p>This is the first, and still the only widely commercialized TV tech that can switch its light source off on a pixel-by-pixel basis, allowing perfect black levels and near-infinite contrast. However, due to their organic nature, OLED TVs suffer from a lack of brightness and the potential for “burn-in” that can kill pixels.</p>
<p>There is another type of self-illuminating tech called Micro LED. Rather than organic, it uses microscopic inorganic LEDs to form the individual pixel elements. Those can also be turned on or off individually, so they offer the same pure blacks and sky-high contrast as OLED. At the same time they’re potentially brighter than OLED and don’t suffer from burn-in. The tech is still prohibitively expensive to manufacture, though, so none have arrived to market other than Samsung’s <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-wall-virtual-movie-studio-121524064.html">The Wall</a>, which costs a cool $40,000.</p>

<p>Before talking about Micro RGB, let’s look at color space and gamut both for HDR, which uses the BT.2020 standard, and SDR, commonly associated with the REC.709 standard. REC.709 is ideal for regular HD content like TV broadcasts and YouTube videos. It can display a limited set of colors and brightness is generally capped at 100 nits.</p>
<p>BT.2020, however, is designed for high-end HDR streaming and 4K or 8K content creation (via Dolby Vision, HDR 10 or HDR10+). It has a much wider color gamut, meaning it can display a wider variety of colors and a bigger chunk of the visible color spectrum. It’s also designed for significantly higher brightness levels of 1,000 nits or more.</p>
<p>To achieve the color accuracy required for BT.2020, TVs must have extremely accurate red, green and blue pixels. Up until last year, the most color-accurate TVs used quantum dot technology and achieved a maximum of around 85 percent BT.2020 coverage (some projectors can cover 100 percent or more of the BT.2020 spectrum as they use RGB lasers to create colors).</p>
<p>That brings us to Micro RGB (also known as <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2025/rgb-micro-led-tv/">RGB Mini LED</a>), the most advanced LED panel yet. Unlike the uniform white or blue backlights found on Mini LED models, it features individually-controlled, precise red, green and blue LED backlights that shine through a liquid crystal layer. It also offers more local dimming zones. The net result is higher color accuracy and better contrast than regular Mini LED displays, but with potentially greater brightness than OLED. Since each pixel still can’t be turned on and off like OLED or Micro LED, though, contrast falls short of those technologies.</p>

<p>So far, there is one and only one Micro RGB TV on the market, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=91b8cbcb-66aa-4a89-8cd3-0d9cd5003a6d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=Samsung%E2%80%99s+115-inch+4K+MR95F+model&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy90dnMvbWljcm8tcmdiLzExNS1pbmNoLWNsYXNzLW1pY3JvLXJnYi00ay10di1za3UtbXJuMTE1bXI5NWZ4emEvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5MWI4Y2JjYi02NmFhLTRhODktOGNkMy0wZDljZDUwMDNhNmQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbXN1bmcuY29tL3VzL3R2cy9taWNyby1yZ2IvMTE1LWluY2gtY2xhc3MtbWljcm8tcmdiLTRrLXR2LXNrdS1tcm4xMTVtcjk1Znh6YS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWKdK7nyNi920vDZ5ELJduQFbpIHcWuXY34VWZQXBu79&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Fmicro-rgb%2F115-inch-class-micro-rgb-4k-tv-sku-mrn115mr95fxza%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/us/tvs/micro-rgb/115-inch-class-micro-rgb-4k-tv-sku-mrn115mr95fxza/">Samsung’s 115-inch 4K MR95F model</a>. The color accuracy is impressive with 100 percent coverage of the challenging BT.2020 HDR standard, an industry-first and huge leap over quantum dot tech. That means it can produce billions of colors natively and display a higher percentage of them in the visible spectrum than any TV to date.</p>
<p>Samsung left out a few key specs like the local dimming zone count, only saying that it has four times more than its similarly-priced 115-inch Q90F QLED model (so likely around 3,600). The company also failed to disclose the total brightness in nits, but the figure should be impressive given the potential of Micro RGB.</p>
<p>We were gobsmacked with the MR95F Micro RGB model in person. Engadget editor Sam Rutherford said it produced “stunningly rich and vivid colors that put Samsung’s other top-tier TVs to shame,” including the aforementioned Q90F. It also came with an equally stunning $29,999 price tag.</p>
<p>A couple of other manufacturers including <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chy-5VW5Uxo">HiSense</a> have also released RGB Mini LED models similar to Samsung’s Micro RGB, but they differ slightly in that the RGB modules are larger than the ones found on Samsung’s latest TVs.</p>

<p>Luckily, the number of Micro RGB TVs is about to dramatically increase. Earlier this month, Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">announced</a> a full lineup using the technology with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch screen sizes, saying they’d set “a new standard for premium home viewing.” Those sets will also offer 100 percent BT.2020 HDR coverage under a new certification standard called Micro RGB Precision Color 100. While certainly likely to carry more reasonable prices than the first model, they’ll probably still be Samsung’s most expensive TVs when released later this year.</p>
<p>And on Sunday, Samsung also revealed a 130-inch Micro RGB prototype meant to showcase the technology. Once again, it blew us away partially just because of the huge size, but also due to the incredible &quot;color accuracy and richness,&quot; as Engadget editor Devindra Hardawar put it. &quot;I couldn’t help but notice how everyone just looked a bit stunned, like the monkeys from <em>2001</em> seeing the monolith for the first time,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>At the same time, LG <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">announced</a>  its first Micro RGB “evo” TV lineup in 75-, 86- and 100-inch models. The company is also promising 100 percent BT.2020 color gamut coverage and said the sets will have over a thousand local dimming zones for color control. Not only that, it said that its new TVs will deliver 100 percent coverage in SDR modes as well, both for Adobe RGB and the challenge P3 standard.</p>
<p>It was interesting to compare LG&#39;s Wallpaper and other OLED sets with the new Micro RGB tech, with our editor Devindra again being amazed. &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">LG already announced its Micro RGB set</a> a few weeks ago, but that didn&#39;t prepare me for standing in front of the 100-inch demo TV it brought to CES,&quot; he said. &quot;Throughout a variety of clips, colors looked wonderfully rich, and the overall texture of the images looked surprisingly life-like.&quot;</p>
<p>For its part, Hisense also <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hisense-unveils-innovating-a-brighter-life-at-ces-2026-302653092.html">unveiled</a> a lineup of &quot;evo&quot; TVs that it calls RGB Mini-LED instead of Micro RGB. It&#39;s offering them at two price points, called the UR9 and UR8, with sizes ranging from 55 up to 100 inches. The company is promising an even wider color gamut than Samsung and LG with up to 110 percent BT.2020 coverage and &quot;color control achieving 134 bits,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, HiSense had a surprise up its sleeve with the launch of an enormous 163-inch Micro LED TV to compete with Samsung&#39;s The Wall. The company actually calls it RGBY Micro LED, because it introduces a fourth yellow color into the RGB mix. The reason, according to the company, is that yellow expands the color spectrum &quot;where human vision perceives the most nuance.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> 
<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout. If that doesn't work, it's <strong>WS24D5XT3DV9</strong>. We haven't gotten a chance to try this one yet, but it looks promising.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-new-45w-charger-from-ces-is-already-10-off-160707324.html?src=rss]]></description>

Inside the fridge, GE Appliances also includes a flush-mount LED bar with a built-in camera that can deliver &quot;real-time, on-demand snapshots of crisper drawers, focusing on the most costly and perishable items.&quot; This &quot;FridgeFocus&quot; feature is supposed to prevent you from overbuying perishable produce that you might already have, by letting you see which perishables might go bad first.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Profile_SmartFridge_1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Profile_SmartFridge_1.jpg" style="height:2500px;width:2400px;" alt="A silver four door refrigerator nestled in wooden shelves." data-uuid="e2f6db31-934c-4b98-af4f-87163e27af80"/><figcaption>GE Appliances&#39; fridge is stainless steel and has a built-in touchscreen display.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>On top of those smart features, the GE Profile Smart Refrigerator has a four-door stainless steel design, with door-in-door storage and an adjustable temperature drawer. The fridge also has an 8-inch touchscreen display for viewing recipes or the current weather conditions, and microphones for accepting voice commands. When you&#39;re dispensing water, the fridge&#39;s water dispenser is supposed to be smart enough to fill a container with the exact right amount of water using built-in sensors, too.</p><p>The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant will be available from GE Appliances and select retailers starting in April 2026 for a suggested MSRP of $4,899.</p><p><strong>Update, January 5, 1:09PM ET: </strong>Headline and article updated to refer to GE Appliances rather than GE, because they’re separate companies.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ge-appliances-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326073.html?src=rss]]></description>

It premieres on January 12. <em>One Last Adventure</em> focuses on the making of season five, so it&#39;s not a full series retrospective. This seems similar to what Disney+ does a few weeks after a popular Star Wars or Marvel show drops.</p>
<p>Still, it&#39;s a documentary about the very last season of the show, so there&#39;s likely to be some tearful goodbyes and all of that jazz. As a matter of fact, the trailer shows plenty of hugs along with sit-down interviews.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f2b829906fe14046b9cda0296809b6b0"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLxvdUroRic?si=u-SwIUcGi-5oH4nI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It&#39;ll shine a light on how some of the stunts and set pieces came together, which is cool. <em>Stranger Things</em>, after all, is primarily a show about spectacle and season five had plenty to spare. The Duffer Brothers will also discuss how they came to write some of those final character arcs (no spoilers here.)</p>
<p>If you&#39;re grieving the loss of Steve Harrington, Delightful Derrick, Eleven and the rest, this should make for a nice watch. It&#39;s worth noting that while <em>Stranger Things</em> has doled out its last needle drop, the franchise itself is still going.&nbsp;</p>

So what's in store for this year's show? New leadership, for starters.</p>
<p>The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-to-appoint-james-fishler-to-c-suite-as-the-company-strengthens-its-u-s-strategy-ahead-o">press release</a>, Hisense said Fishler's experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company "builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES."</p>

<p>Hisense is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8-2WhTCCI">livestreaming the event</a> on its YouTube channel today (Monday, January 5) at 1PM ET. We've embedded it below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand.

Vocci is one such gadget, a titanium ring with a single button capable of recording audio for up to eight hours on a charge.

Instead, you’ll be able to record whole conversations and meetings from the comfort of your proximal phalanx.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can start and end recordings by double clicking the ring’s single button, while single clicks are used to mark important moments within the recording. Tagged moments will instruct the AI app to add more context, highlights or reminders, where appropriate. Once the file has been processed, you’ll receive a transcript, complete with a summary and commentary.</p><p>I’m told the ring has a range of five meters, but I was unable to hear an example recording or see a working demo of the technology. I did ask why a ring would be more effective at capturing a room’s worth of chat over, say, using a recording app on one’s phone laid on a table. But the response was to point out a user may forget to start the recording, and you can’t disagree with that.</p><p>Vocci will ship with a charging case, and will be able to recharge to full in half an hour, but it’s not clear yet how much (if at all) power will be stored in the case’s batteries. We also don’t know how much the ring will cost, but it’s likely to be available for pre-order at some point in February. As for the ring’s pedigree, it comes from Gyges Labs, the company which leant its name, manufacturing and engineering expertise to last year’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/halliday-glasses-review-ambitious-smart-glasses-with-frustrating-flaws-130000207.html" data-i13n="slk:Halliday Smart Glasses;cpos:4;pos:1">Halliday Smart Glasses</a>.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/voccis-ai-note-taking-ring-aims-to-do-much-more-170536442.html?src=rss]]></description>

Maxwell 2 pairs that with 90mm planar magnetic drivers, which offer a wide frequency range of 10Hz to 50kHz. Audeze says the result is clearer detail for every in-game sound from subtle directional footsteps in competitive FPS games to bass-heavy moments like big explosions with near-zero distortion.</p>

The headset can connect with a wireless USB-C dongle as well as Bluetooth 5.3. Battery life is rated at over 80 hours of wireless playback and the headset supports USB-C fast charging.</p>
<p>Pricing is set at $329 for the PlayStation version and $349 for the Xbox model (which supports Dolby Atmos on compatible devices). Both versions also support Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch and they’re available now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/audeze-has-unveiled-the-maxwell-2-gaming-headset-at-ces-2026-170056068.html?src=rss]]></description>

The new model revealed at CES 2026 has many of the bells and whistles found on professional-level projectors including a dynamic IRIS system for improved contrast, along with a new thermal system designed to boost brightness.</p>
<p>The Titan Noir Max has a design to XGIMI&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cc6c7651-cb49-4ad3-b82e-8f4e898e23c4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Titan+model&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V1LnhnaW1pLmNvbS9wYWdlcy90aXRhbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2M2Yzc2NTEtY2I0OS00YWQzLWI4MmUtOGY0ZTg5OGUyM2M0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V1LnhnaW1pLmNvbS9wYWdlcy90aXRhbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAajl8pNfxM89vXljZfgtRxRdhqtQm66ys-3DPPL1ynIp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Feu.xgimi.com%2Fpages%2Ftitan" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://eu.xgimi.com/pages/titan">Titan model</a> announced last year, but it&#39;s taller and a bit squarer with an elegant grille-like pattern on the front. As with other XGIMI models, it features a laser light engine and 4K video quality, though the company didn&#39;t say if it had the same big Texas Instruments 0.78-inch DMD (digital micromirror device) chip as the original Titan model.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The key new feature is a dynamic IRIS system that boosts native contrast to 10,000:1 for deeper blacks and brighter highlights. At the same time, it boasts new &quot;precision tuned optics&quot; (ie a better lens) also designed to improve contrast and color nuance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another key feature is a re-engineered DMD architecture that can handle &quot;substantially higher light power densities,&quot; XGIMI says. This should allow for increased brightness, though the company didn&#39;t provide a figure in ANSI Lumens. It would be impressive if it topped the 5,000 Lumen Titan, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many other specs are lacking, like color accuracy in the Rec.2020 space. However, the company is promising a lot, saying that the Titan Noir Max will offer &quot;the stability, accuracy, and reliability required for color-critical work, studio environments, and high-end installations.&quot; At the same time, it&#39;s also targeted at home enthusiasts, promising to &quot;turn a blank wall into a cinematic event.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>XGIMI&#39;s Titan was only recently released for $3,999 but there&#39;s no word yet on the price or release date of the Titan Noir Max. Unlike the Horizon 20 series (which has a smaller 0.47-inch DMD chip) the Titan has received very few reviews so far, but one <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.mondoprojos.fr/2025/12/20/test-xgimi-titan/">French projector site</a> gave it a solid score.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xgimis-titan-noir-max-4k-projector-has-a-dynamic-iris-for-increased-contrast-170044625.html?src=rss]]></description>

With the Neoma multi-function countertop oven, the company offers AI features that can serve as both sous chef and nutritionist, helping you create dishes that fit your budget, diet and other lifestyle needs. The Brisk It Agentic AI can also help with meal planning and grocery orders on top of automatic cooking cycles for recipes it selects. </p><p>The Neoma has a temperature range from 90 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and cooking times of one minute up to twelve hours. This means you can do everything from baking to roasting, air frying and more. In fact, it comes with an air fry basket, baking pan, oven rack, and crumb tray. The robust steel construction, glass door and interior space should make the Neoma well-suited for most kitchens. </p><p>Brisk It isn’t leaving the grill game though. The company also announced the AI Hybrid Gas Grill at CES. The hybrid bit describes the dual gas and wood pellet combustion, giving users the ability to infuse wood smoke in their high-heat grilling sessions. Of course, Brisk It’s AI goes to work here too, with adaptive cooking and personalized meal plans. </p><p>The AI Hybrid Gas Grill will be available at retailers later this year.

The chip is also equipped with a third-generation Qualcomm Oryon CPU with either six cores or ten cores. For comparison, the Snapdragon X2 Elite gives options of either 12 or 18 cores.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company, this iteration of the CPU boasts up to 35 percent faster single-core performance compared with the previous generation. It also says the six-core model has up to 10 percent faster multi-core performance over the prior model, while the ten-core option has up to 17 percent better multi-core performance.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Projector maker XGIMI has turned up at CES to launch its own range of AR glasses, but don’t get the champagne out too soon. MemoMind is a new brand under which its AI-infused eyewear will be sold, with two distinct units arriving at some point in the near future. The company says it has leveraged its know-how in optics and engineering to produce glasses which are unobtrusively light, all the better for blending into your daily life. Fashionistas will even be overjoyed to learn the glasses’ ship in eight different frame styles, five different temple designs and can be worn with prescription lenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Memo One is the company’s flagship option, with dual-eye displays and integrated speakers so you can see and hear your AI assistant. The Memo Air, meanwhile, is a more stripped down model&nbsp; weighing just 28.9 grams which just has a single eye display. Unfortunately, the company is using microLED displays rather than waveguides, making them a far harder sell for a lot of would-be users. After all, putting something that small so close to your eye but behind your prescription means it’s a painful experience for short sighted folks to focus on text. As I explained in my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/halliday-glasses-review-ambitious-smart-glasses-with-frustrating-flaws-130000207.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Halliday review</a>, this technology is no friend to the glasses wearers who would otherwise be the ideal early adopters.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/20251218-110941_%281%29.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/20251218-110941_%281%29.png" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="MemoMind Lineup" data-uuid="97258fc3-192a-4976-be81-8062f6573f6a"/><figcaption>MemoMind Lineup</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">XGIMI</div></figure><p>The glasses are just a vehicle for the company’s AI assistant, promising translation, summarization, note-taking, reminders and contextual guidance. Unlike some of its would-be rivals, XGIMI says its platform will switch between OpenAI, Azure and (Alibaba’s) Qwen depending on what it thinks will offer you the best result for each task. Naturally, we’ll need to get them in to test before passing final judgment on their qualities but, you can color us naturally hostile to those damn microLEDs until we’re convinced otherwise.</p><p>XGIMI says the flagship Memo One will be available to pre-order “soon,” priced at $599, with additional models available further down the line.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/xgimi-best-known-for-projectors-launches-its-own-smart-glasses-170000968.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2026, HP is showing off its latest flagship consumer laptop: The Omnibook Ultra 14.  It features an all-new super thin design that’s much tougher than it looks.&nbsp;</p><p>According to HP, the Omnibook Ultra 14 is the “world’s most durably slim 14-inch consumer notebook,” which is a somewhat convoluted way of saying the system remains quite portable — just 0.42 inches thick — while still passing 20 different military standard tests (MIL-STD-810) for things like shock resistance, drops and extreme temperatures. The whole system is crafted from aluminum, though instead of taking a unibody approach like you see on Apple’s MacBooks, HP opted for forge stamped manufacturing which is said to give the laptop added strength and bend resistance. The result is a notebook that’s both 52 percent lighter than the previous model at 2.8 pounds and five percent thinner than a 2025 M4 MacBook Air 13. And after seeing it in person, I have to say it looks pretty slick, too.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylYtEvhpIVw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>As you’d expect from a premium ultraportable, the Omnibook comes with a vivid 3K OLED display, up to 64GB of memory, 2TB of storage and your choice of either an Intel Core Ultra 3 CPU or a Snapdragon Elite X2 chip. That said, thanks to an exclusive partnership with Qualcomm, anyone planning on running a lot of AI-based apps on the Ultra 14 may want to go with the Snapdragon variant as it’ll come with a slightly more powerful NPU that maxes out at 85 TOPS (that’s <em>trillions</em> of operations per second) rather than the 80 TOPS you’d get from other OEMs. Furthermore, to help support strong sustained performance, the Ultra 14 is also the first Omnibook to feature a built-in vapor chamber.&nbsp;</p><p>Granted, as a pretty straightforward ultraportable, this thing doesn’t have a ton of special features. But even so, I appreciate that HP didn’t cut corners regarding its keyboard, which has a nice feel that’s not too stiff or bouncy and sits above a rather large touchpad. The company even found room for quad speakers and three USB-C ports that offer Thunderbolt 4, power delivery (USB PD 3.1) and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9b9cc85f-2eab-41ba-9c43-53c5b121e384" /><p>My one small nitpick is that I would have liked to see an SD or microSD card reader as well, but considering HP’s emphasis on portability and toughness, I’m not surprised that it didn&#39;t make it. The other thing I’m not so sure about is the Omnibook name in general. It’s been a little while since HP axed the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-spectre-x360-14-review-2024-keeping-the-2-in-1-laptop-dream-alive-140045823.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Spectre branding</a> for its top tier consumer laptops and I kind of wish HP would bring it back as it sounds better and feels more befitting of a flagship system like this.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, if you’re in the market for a premium 14-inch Windows laptop, the Omnibook Ultra 14 looks like it will be a very strong contender when it goes on sale later this month starting at $1,550.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-hp-omnibook-ultra-14-at-ces-2026-super-sleek-and-surprisingly-durable-170000330.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We typically see LG TV announcements a bit before CES, but this year the company had a surprise in store. CES 2026 marks the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">return of LG&#39;s ultra-thin &quot;Wallpaper&quot; TV</a>. The latest version sports a gorgeous OLED screen and wireless connectivity, and it&#39;s about as thin as a pencil. We were able to check out the new Wallpaper TV during a CES preview event, along with LG’s Gallery and Micro RGB sets. The company also announced refreshed OLED and LED sets for this year, but it&#39;s clear that 2026 will be filled with intriguing TVs for a variety of consumers.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-5.jpg" style="height:1396px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV" data-uuid="58f3d374-411f-4f30-ace0-0a163a26875f"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="831aff76-954b-413f-ad53-1c525ef027ff">The Wallpaper TV (LG W6)</h2><p>If money were no object, I&#39;d want a 100-inch LG Wallpaper TV in my family room immediately. It looks shockingly thin in person — almost as if it&#39;s some sort of sci-fi prop — and it delivers the rich colors and dark levels we expect from OLED. Cable management is also a cinch, since it requires just a single power cable. The A/V inputs are handled by LG&#39;s One Connect box, which you can position wirelessly up to 10 meters away from the TV. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-2.jpg" style="height:1333px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear" data-uuid="76d95849-a1b3-4ee2-b3e8-944800c0dba6"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Wallpaper OLED TV from the rear</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The LG W6 combines the best of LG&#39;s OLED technology, including &quot;Hyper Radiant Color&quot; for improved black levels and color, &quot;Brightness Booster Ultra&quot; to crank up luminance 3.9 times more than conventional OLEDs and a reflection free screen material. LG&#39;s Alpha 9 Gen 3 processor beefs up its performance, and its NPU also helps to improve upscaling and overall image performance. (And yes, you can also access generative AI features via Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.)</p><p>All of that adds up to one of the most remarkable TVs I&#39;ve seen in years. I haven&#39;t been too enamored with other TV gimmicks lately, like everything trying to mimic Samsung&#39;s The Frame, or the usless 8K sets. But a super-thin wireless TV with the best OLED panel available? That&#39;s the stuff dreams are made of. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-6.jpg" style="height:1253px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV" data-uuid="3419e13f-8e77-4dd1-8a33-97994b44a84c"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s 2026 Gallery TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="c4158606-b48b-431e-b6d6-e9e573054349">The Gallery TV competes with Samsung’s Frame</h2><p>While LG has made Gallery TVs before, in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">2026 it&#39;s making a more concerted effort</a> to take on Samsung&#39;s popular Frame TV. LG says the new sets were designed with the help of museum curators, which helps the &quot;Gallery Mode&quot; adjust brightness and contrast to specific works of art. They also ship with magnetic frame-like bezels, and they have anti-reflective screens to help make the art shine. </p><p>In person, the new Gallery TV looks fine, though it&#39;s easy to tell that the colors and contrast levels don&#39;t match LG&#39;s premium OLED TVs.  To avoid burn-in issues, these sets feature Mini LED panels. As I noted above, I&#39;m not the core consumer for one of these TVs, but it&#39;s nice to see more competition against Samsung&#39;s Frame TVs. (Despite pioneering the idea of TVs displaying art, the Frame sets are still fairly mediocre when it comes to actually watching TV shows and movies.) </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/LG_CES_2026-4.jpg" style="height:1316px;width:2000px;" alt="LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV" data-uuid="72bf06b4-100f-4522-a0be-2025ac961562"/><figcaption>LG&#39;s Micro RGB TV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="0b43ff1a-5c6e-434e-b754-a7d35f025952"><strong>Micro RGB looks like a genuine Mini LED upgrade</strong></h2><p>As if we needed more TV acronyms to worry about, say hello to Micro RGB, a new technology built atop Mini LED to cover vastly more color range. Just don&#39;t confuse it with Micro LED, which is the wildly expensive evolutionary step forward for OLED. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">LG already announced its Micro RGB set</a> a few weeks ago, but that didn&#39;t prepare me for standing in front of the 100-inch demo TV it brought to CES. Throughout a variety of clips, colors looked wonderfully rich, and the overall texture of the images looked surprisingly life-like. </p><p>I&#39;d have to compare it to LG&#39;s Wall TV side-by-side to truly see how Micro RGB competes with OLED, but technically OLED should still offer better contrast and black levels, since each of its pixels are self-emissive. But sure, if I couldn&#39;t get a 100-inch Wall TV in my family room, I certainly wouldn&#39;t turn down an enormous Micro RGB. </p><h2 id="c5a82153-d91f-4549-93d2-6ed9c5eee16d"><strong>What about LG&#39;s other OLED TVs?</strong></h2><p>All of the next-generation OLED technology in the wallpaper TV will also make its way into LG&#39;s G6 OLED models, while the new C6 and other lines will see improvements of their own. All I can say is that the new G6 OLED looked impressive, with a noticeably brighter picture and HDR elements compared to G-series OLEDs from several years ago.  </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html?src=rss]]></description>

The appropriately-named Work voice recorder is primarily intended for professionals, but also seems useful for students and anyone else who wants an AI to transcribe conversations.</p>
<p>To that end, the company promises 97-percent transcription accuracy via the AI algorithm. The affiliated app will also provide summaries of conversations, like many modern AI tools. Users can double-tap the gadget during important parts of a conversation to ensure it gets preferential treatment.</p>

<p>None of this is really that new.

The Soundcore Work, however, is extremely small and could make for an inconspicuous recording method.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker, one of the leaders in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html" data-i13n="slk:third-party chargers;cpos:1;pos:1">third-party chargers</a>, has unveiled a new portfolio of "smart" chargers and docks at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html" data-i13n="slk:CES 2026;cpos:2;pos:1">CES 2026</a>. The company says the lineup adds improved visual interfaces, faster Qi2 wireless charging and "upgraded ecosystems" for the latest line of iPhone models.</p>
<p>First up is the Anker Nano Charger, which features a smart display, 180-degree foldable prongs and provides up to 45W of power. The plug can identify the exact iPhone model connected and then deliver the right amount of power for your phone. Anker says the Nano uses three-stage power delivery and a "Care Mode" that the company claims keeps batteries cooler than some competing 45W chargers. It arrives in late January 2026 and will retail for $40.</p>
<p>For fans of wireless charging stations, the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station offers a 3-in-1 solution for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. It uses a "AirCool" system for "faster, safer performance" and offers up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. The design is also foldable for compact travel. It's set for release in Q1 2026 and will retail for $150.</p>
<p>The company debuted a clamp-on 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip with 70W of output and built-in surge protection. It sports two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and six AC outlets. The Nano Power Strip is getting a late January release, and it will sell for $70.</p>
<p>Anker also unveiled a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station. This serves as an all-in-one hub with support for up to three displays (with 4K resolution supported on a single display), up to 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between connected devices. It also features a removable 6-in-1 hub with SD and microSD card readers, a USB-A port and a 5 Gbps USB-C port. The Nano Docking Station is available now and retails for $150.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker&#39;s sub-brand Eufy just revealed a high-tech baby bottle washer at CES 2026. The Bottle Washer S1 is filled to the brim with nifty features that should please frazzled parents.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been designed to clean deeper than rival models. The Bottle Washer S1 features a built-in water softener, a first in the product category, which should help remove stubborn minerals. It also includes proprietary HydroBlast technology that cleans baby bottles from every angle. This is assisted by the inclusion of a multi-layer rotating spray.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sterilizes up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and dries in just 40 minutes. These are both fantastic metrics for baby bottle washers. It also holds more bottles than comparable units, with the ability to clean eight bottle sets at once.</p>

<p>The device allows for complete app control, which lets users set cleaning schedules and perform simple maintenance routines. After cleaning, it can keep bottle sets in a sterile standby mode for up to 72 hours. This really looks like the best bottle washer out there, but quality comes at a price. We don&#39;t have any details yet regarding pricing or availability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eufy also announced a portable milk cooler at CES. This should be another boon for busy parents.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/eufy-just-revealed-a-tech-heavy-baby-bottle-washer-at-ces-160021666.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Anker affiliate just unveiled the 1080p Nebula P1i portable projector that's less than half the price and even more portable, albeit with less brightness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of detachable speakers like the Nebula P1, the P1i's speakers are embedded in the projector and can be flipped open and tilted through 180 degrees. It also lacks the P1's tilting projector body and instead offers a stand that can incline the projector from zero to 12 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though it offers the same 1080p maximum resolution as the Nebula P1, it's a bit less bright at 400 instead of 650 ANSI Lumens. Like the more expensive model, though, it supports autofocus, auto keystone correction and screen fit, which will make setup easy for spontaneous outdoor use. And like other projectors in the Nebula lineup, it supports Google TV so you can stream Netflix, Prime Video, Disney and other apps. Best of all, the Nebula P1i is priced at a very reasonable $369 and is set to arrive in "early 2026," according to Soundcore.&nbsp;</p>

As a reminder, the projector delivers 3,500 ANSI lumens and an impressive 110 percent coverage of the Rec.2020 HDR color space. The sound system, meanwhile, features a floating subwoofer, 80W soundbar speakers and two wireless satellite speakers for 7.1.4 surround sound. It even supports Dolby Atmos, which the projector on its own doesn't do, while offering IP43 protection from light rain and dust if you want to use it outdoors.</p>

At CES 2026, Anker is trying to change that with the Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro, the company&#39;s first open-ear earbuds that offer ANC.</p>
<p>The Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro features a similar adjustable ear-hook design to Anker&#39;s previous <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:soundcore;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=179e17fc-174d-4d38-8428-4b655a48c3d4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39d9829e-e044-4b85-a493-4fe2cd29ec83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcore&amp;linkText=AeroFit+2&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3VuZGNvcmUuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2EzODc0LWFlcm9maXQtMi1vcGVuLWVhcmJ1ZHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5ZDk4MjllLWUwNDQtNGI4NS1hNDkzLTRmZTJjZDI5ZWM4MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc291bmRjb3JlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9hMzg3NC1hZXJvZml0LTItb3Blbi1lYXJidWRzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWz4BTqgiAbE2KefW3MIXfU9FMNdIdZyhFbb_ShJ1-3S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundcore.com%2Fproducts%2Fa3874-aerofit-2-open-earbuds" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.soundcore.com/products/a3874-aerofit-2-open-earbuds"><ins>AeroFit 2</ins></a> and AeroFit, but with one extra level of adjustment to help the earbuds create more of a seal in your ear. That change, plus tweaks to the tips of the Pro, seem to be how Anker is offering ANC on the new earbuds. Anker says the algorithm running on the Pro checks 380,000 times per second to adjust its level of noise cancellation on the fly. The earbuds&#39; custom diaphragms also offer deeper bass and clearer highs, according to the company.</p>

<p>Alongside new open-ear earbuds, Anker is also introducing a new portable Bluetooth speaker. The Soundcore Boom Go 3i is a palm-sized speaker with a strap that&#39;s ideal for attaching to a bag or taking on a camping trip. Anker says the 15W speaker gets 22 hours of battery life, and that the Boom Go 3i&#39;s 4,800mAh battery can be used to charge other devices in an emergency. With an IP68 rating, the speaker also has ample dust and water protection.</p>

<p>Anker says the Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro will be available in February for $179.99. Final pricing for the Soundcore Boom Go 3i wasn&#39;t shared by Anker, but the company says the speaker will be priced between $65-$80 and will go on sale in March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ankers-new-aerofit-2-earbuds-can-switch-between-open-ear-and-anc-form-factors-160014977.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>8BitDo just revealed a new gamepad at CES and it&#39;s a doozy. The Ultimate 3E Controller for XBox is a modular marvel that should suit just about any configuration preference. That&#39;s because many elements are swappable.</p>
<p>There are two different button modules, each with a different feel when pressing down. There are several joystick options, including standard, tall and thick-neck designs. The controller even ships with a pair of D-pad options. One is intended for precision and the other for &quot;smooth, directional rolls.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/a1d86a40-df5e-11f0-bf77-0b3c7dd18e7e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/a1d86a40-df5e-11f0-bf77-0b3c7dd18e7e" style="height:606px;width:907px;" alt="Thumbsticks." data-uuid="3dfecae9-1c24-3be7-9fef-29c836c20a82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">8BitDo</div></figure>
<p>There are other bells and whistles here. The Ultimate 3E offers a 1000Hz max polling rate, hall-effect impulse triggers, remappable bumpers that have been designed for speed and customizable 6-axis motion control. It also ships with a wireless charging case. This thing is a beast.</p>
<p>Despite being officially licensed by Xbox, the controller works with other platforms. It looks like a great option for PC, Android and Apple devices.</p>
<p>Now for the bad news. These pro-level features come with a pro-level price tag. The Ultimate 3E costs $150. The company says preorders will open up in the near future and that it should ship later in the year. In the meantime, you&#39;ll have to make due with this nifty <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-all-button-arcade-controller-is-almost-as-thin-as-a-macbook-pro-161712267.html">arcade-style controller</a> by 8BitDo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-ultimate-3e-gamepad-for-xbox-offers-swappable-button-modules-and-joysticks-160011248.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like only a few years ago that Anker made nothing more than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-anker-laptop-power-bank-soothed-my-self-inflicted-battery-anxiety-123000024.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">batteries</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-announces-new-140w-wall-charger-with-a-handy-built-in-display-at-ces-2025-030027200.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">chargers</a>. But 15 years into its history, the company&#39;s CES portfolio continues to illustrate how much it&#39;s expanded. Among other announcements, the company has a new robot vacuum, video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. They&#39;re all rolling out under Anker&#39;s Eufy smart home brand.</p><p>The company hopes its Eufy Clean Robot Vacuum Omni S2 will be your next robovac. The $1,600 device vacuums with 100 AW suction, and it mops, too. Anker claims the vac works on shag carpets up to about 2 inches (5 cm) in pile height. It has an 11.4-inch rolling mop that applies up to 15 N of downward pressure.</p><p>As is increasingly common in robovacs, Omni S2 uses AI to identify floor types and adjust several factors on the fly. These include cleaning mode, suction, scrubbing force and wheel height. The machine can also generate lightly oxidizing disinfectants (a hypochlorous acid and ozone water solution) inside its tank.</p><p>Presales for the Eufy Clean Robot Vacuum Omni S2 begin on January 6. Shipping and in-store availability for the $1,600 robovac kicks off on January 20.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_2.jpg" style="height:1791px;width:3184px;" alt="A person reaching their finger to touch a smart doorbell" data-uuid="a5582f97-afa5-4b18-8910-c8b82aa106c1"/><figcaption>Eufy Video Doorbell S4</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker</div></figure><p>Anker also has a new doorbell, the Eufy Video Doorbell S4. It includes an AI-powered people detection feature with auto-framing. The doorbell has 3,024 x 3,024 resolution at 24 FPS and offers a panoramic (180 x 180-degree) view.</p><p>You can use the doorbell in either wired or wireless mode, and it supports solar charging. The Video Doorbell S4 is scheduled to launch &quot;later in Q1&quot; for $280.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eufy_Solar_Wall_Light_Cam_S4_Lifestyle_Image_2.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eufy_Solar_Wall_Light_Cam_S4_Lifestyle_Image_2.png" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Product lifestyle photo of a solar-powered smart light mounted on an outdoor wall of a home" data-uuid="9da19c6f-b524-4c92-81cb-15b84cc1636a"/><figcaption>Eufy Solar Wall Light Cam S4</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker</div></figure><p>Along similar lines, there&#39;s the Solar Wall Light Cam S4. The outdoor light has a built-in 4K camera with an f/1.6 aperture. The light has a color temperature ranging from warm white (2700K) to cool white (6500K).</p><p>As its name suggests, it supports solar charging. It’s bundled with a detachable 2W solar panel. It also has a 10,000mAh battery that&#39;s rated for up to two months. Anker says the Solar Wall Light Cam S4 will arrive in Q1 for $200.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/anker_3.jpg" style="height:4483px;width:7969px;" alt="Product lifestyle photo of a mother and daughter using a mounted smart lock.

It has &quot;advanced 3D face recognition&quot; that can identify you and your family from up to 10 feet away, unlocking accordingly. Its camera has 2K resolution and a 135-degree field of view, which should capture visitors from head to toe. The lock has a removable 15,000mAh battery (rated for six months) and a smaller 800mAh backup battery to keep things running while the main one is charging.</p><p>The Smart Lock E40 supports Matter, Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home Assistant and Samsung SmartThings. It&#39;s expected to launch in Q1 at Home Depot (online and in stores) for $300.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ankers-ces-smart-home-lineup-includes-a-1600-eufy-robovac-160000133.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JLab, known for quality consumer audio that doesn&#39;t break the bank, is diving further into gaming. At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, the company has new keyboards, mice and headsets aimed at gamers. Sticking with the brand&#39;s &quot;bang for your buck&quot; angle, they&#39;re available in three reasonably priced tiers.</p><p>The entry-level tier adopts the Nightfall brand name, which JLab already used on its 2023 gaming headphones. (They&#39;re still available and now come in pink and white colors, alongside the preexisting black.) Joining them is a $40 &quot;ultra-light&quot; mouse that weighs 53g. Also costing $40 is a Nightfall keyboard that the company claims has &quot;unmatched precision and accuracy for its price.&quot; Its specs include a 52±7 gram-force actuation and a 2.4mm key travel distance.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jlabs_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jlabs_2.jpg" style="height:2274px;width:3789px;" alt="A keyboard, mouse and gaming headset" data-uuid="069b2486-3bbc-4df3-8081-0ece5528ce0f"><figcaption>JLab&#39;s Midnight tier</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLabs</div></figure><p>JLab’s mid-range suite is called Midnight. In that tier, you&#39;ll find a $100 mechanical tenkeyless keyboard with N-key rollover, anti-ghosting, and a media dial. You&#39;ll also find the $70 Midnight mouse with a 1,000Hz polling rate. And there&#39;s a $100 wireless gaming headset with 50mm drivers and an estimated 70+ hours of battery life.</p><p>Finally, there&#39;s the premium (but still reasonably affordable) Daybreak tier. This segment&#39;s mouse costs $100 and offers &quot;true 1:1 tracking&quot; with a PAW3395 sensor. Meanwhile, the $150 Daybreak keyboard is a mechanical tenkeyless model with magnetic keys and a built-in palm rest. The $130 Daybreak headset uses dual drivers (50mm + 20mm) and supports DTS Headphone:X Spatial Audio.</p><p>JLab hasn&#39;t yet announced specific release dates. But it says all the new gaming products will arrive in Q2 2026.

You can pick up the smartwatch for $300, which is 25 percent off its regular price, a discount of $100. Discounts tend to increase as we get closer to September, when the next generation of Apple Watch is typically announced.</p>
<p>The Series 11 is our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html"><ins>best overall smartwatch</ins></a> pick, and we gave it a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html"><ins>hands-on review</ins></a>. We were impressed with the battery life, which lasted longer than the 24 hours it&#39;s rated for in our testing. We also liked how lightweight and thin the watch is. The 9.7mm thick case on the Series 11 ties the Series 10 for the thinnest Apple Watch so far.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fitness and health tracking are the main appeals of an Apple Watch, and the Series 11 introduces sleep tracking and hypertension notifications. The sleep tracking was comfortable thanks to the watch&#39;s small form factor. The watch also added a new wrist flick gesture that lets you dismiss notifications, end calls and silence alarms or timers.</p>
<p>The GPS + cellular model of the Series 11 is also $100 off, and it&#39;s the first Apple Watch to support 5G networks. It&#39;s not too often you see an Apple product for 25 percent off its retail price, so if you were in the market for a smart watch, and especially if you are an iPhone user, it&#39;s worth checking out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-apple-watch-series-11-is-at-the-lowest-price-weve-ever-seen-154609747.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might think of Bosch as the modern European equivalent to what the GE brand once was in America. It&#39;s a home appliance name (thanks to its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational brand&#39;s core business is really about providing the underlying technology and engineering that powers cars, homes and factories around the world. That focus is reflected at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html">CES 2026</a>, where much of what Bosch is unveiling is intended to be licensed to other companies rather than sold as Bosch-branded products on store shelves.</p>
<p>Case in point is Bosch&#39;s automotive plans at CES. The company is showcasing what it calls &quot;AI in the car,&quot; or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. &quot;Bosch&#39;s AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants,&quot; Bosch board member Markus Heyn <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ai-in-the-car-bosch-presents-cockpit-innovations-at-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-280272.html">said in a press release</a>. We&#39;ll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-boschs-ces-2026-presentation">How to watch Bosch&#39;s CES 2026 presentation</h2>
<p>You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ces-2026-livestream.html">Bosch press page</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzDeUHM8eik">YouTube</a>. (We&#39;ve embedded the stream link below.)</p>

<p id="jump-link-what-to-expect">We&#39;ll also be highlighting any relevant info from Bosch&#39;s presentation in the main Engadget CES 2026 liveblog.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/ces-2026/#what-to-expect">three big themes</a> — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.</p>
<p>Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &quot;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:</p>

The tech giant held its &quot;first look&quot; presentation to show off new home products and make a plethora of AI-infused announcements. New TVs, speakers, projectors and more were among the headliners, along with updated gaming monitors and soundbars.</p>
<p>Many of the products announced on stage were not actually new, but instead had been dripped out by Samsung recently. Like its minimalist Music Studio speakers or new Micro RGB TVs. We did get a closer look a previously undisclosed set, a flagship 130-inch Micro RGB TV framed by a giant metal easel with embedded speakers. It&#39;s one of the most striking sets we&#39;ve ever seen, but it&#39;s much more in the realm of concept than reality. (That&#39;s not to say they won&#39;t sell it, just that we&#39;ve heard no plans and if they do it will be hideously expensive.)</p>

<p>As for the rest of Samsung&#39;s Micro RGB TV line, that may actually be slightly more affordable. The company released its first set last year for an eye-watering $30,000, but that was a 115-inch proof of concept. This year it&#39;ll be <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">offering TVs in more reasonable sizes</a>, including the ever-popular 55-, 65- and 75-inch sets. We don&#39;t know pricing on those but those smaller models will definitely be cheaper than $30,000. For those that want something bigger, there&#39;ll also be 85-, 100- and 115-inch models. As before, the Micro RGB range will offer a purported 100% coverage of the Rec.2020 color space, which is something that even the highest-end OLEDs can&#39;t match.</p>
<p>While they may have been announced prior to CES, we did get <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html">a few minutes in person with Samsung&#39;s Music Studio speakers</a> in the demo area after the big show. The Music Studio 5 and 7 are wireles speakers supporting both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, while the Studio 7 has a 3.1.1 setup with top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers to give an &quot;immersive 3D audio experience.&quot; For all of that, it&#39;s clear the main draw of these new speakers is the design, which is definitely striking.</p>
<p>Another thing from those heady pre-CES days was the Freestyle+, the latest attempt at a micro projector from Samsung. Like previous Freestyle models, it&#39;s small and unobtrusive, but this one is a little brighter and has &quot;smarter AI capabilities.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Freestyle+ reflects Samsung’s vision to create displays that adapt naturally to how people live and move between spaces,” said Hun Lee, Executive Vice President of the Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “By combining true portability with intelligent AI that optimizes both the viewing environment and the content itself, The Freestyle+ makes it easier to enjoy a consistent, high-quality experience wherever you are.”</p>

<p>There were even products that Samsung didn&#39;t mention on stage that we then found in the demo area. Like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html">Samsung HW-QS90H soundbar</a>, a new skew on its popular HW-QS90 line that targets those of us that would rather not have a subwoofer sitting in our living rooms. It&#39;s an all-in-one 7.1.2 soundbar with 13 drivers, including four (we&#39;re assuming) woofers for its &quot;Quad Bass Woofer system.&quot; Or the&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was really that for the big announcements. The rest of the stage show was focused on how Samsung thinks (or really, at this point, insists) AI is going to make all of its products more useful. Demos included using AI noise cancelling to turn off the commentators in a soccer match, using AI to watch recipes on your fridge door, using AI to wash your clothes better (?) and... to cut a long story short, Samsung would very much appreciate it if you could please use AI.</p>
<p>We&#39;re expecting to see and hear more from Samsung during CES, but for now you can find all of our news stories and more detailed hands-on impressions below, or if you want to relieve the event in extruciating detail there&#39;s the livestream replay too. (Don&#39;t worry, though the video is three hours long the event itself  was a tight hour.)</p>

<p>The web model won&#39;t be much different from the existing Alexa+ that&#39;s already available on Echo devices, Fire TV and Fire tablets.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bee, the company behind an always-listening AI wearable that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-acquiring-an-ai-wearable-that-listens-to-everything-you-do-221103233.html"><ins>Amazon acquired last year</ins></a>, has announced new features in a status update. The device is designed to run in the background of daily life and captures conversations or thoughts spoken aloud. Recording can be started or stopped with the push of a button.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Bee, Maria de Lourdes Zollo, says the company has shipped four major updates that will run on the existing Bee Pioneer hardware. The first is “Actions,” which connects Bee to a user&#39;s email and calendar and works to turn spoken commitments into actions. The company says that when you say you need to send an e-mail, for instance, Bee can draft one for you.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Daily Insights” is designed to identify patterns and trends based on information collected over weeks or months. The company says the goal of this feature is to notice things before a user might, including &quot;shifts in your relationships&quot; and recommend personalized goals related to these, like a life coach of sorts.</p>
<p>“Voice Notes” lets a user press the record button on Bee and log a fleeting thought, a task for a to-do list or anything else that a user wants to recall later. Finally, &quot;Templates&quot; is designed to organize and summarize large amounts of information into a more digestible format. It can also create a study plan from a lecture or recap a sales meeting with a client.</p>
<p>Most of these features would presumably be more useful if a user sets their Bee to record constantly, which raises questions around legality and privacy. Zollo says that Bee processes audio in real time so no audio is ever stored, adding that neither Bee nor Amazon ever have access to transcripts. Still, the wearable could come up against recording consent laws which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.justia.com/50-state-surveys/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations/"><ins>vary by jurisdiction</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/bee-has-been-busy-since-its-acquisition-by-amazon-last-year-150025311.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon just revealed the Ember Artline TV at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html">CES 2026</a>. This is a lifestyle TV that displays art, putting it in direct competition with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">Samsung&#39;s The Frame</a>. The 4K QLED screen is extremely thin, at 1.5-inches, so it&#39;ll likely fit just about anywhere.</p>
<p>It also features a glare-reducing matte screen that has been &quot;designed to make your art and photos look great.&quot; The Artline integrates with Amazon Photos and offers access to 2,000 pieces of free art to display. For those worried about electricity usage, the TV includes proprietary technology that senses when someone has entered or left the room and turns on or off accordingly.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The display comes with Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html">new smart assistant Alexa+</a>, allowing it to double as a smart TV. This is helped along by the inclusion of far-field microphones. Alexa+ is a beefier version of the company&#39;s long-standing digital assistant. You can talk to it like a person, if that&#39;s your bag. There&#39;s even a new use case in which Alexa+ analyzes the aesthetics of a room and recommends art to throw on the screen.</p>

<p>This is also a standard TV. It features support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6 and will operate on the Fire TV platform. Customers can choose from 10 magnetic frames in a wide variety of colorways, further diversifying the aesthetics.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have a release date yet, other than &quot;later this spring.&quot; Amazon has released pricing, however, as this TV starts at $899 for the 55-inch version.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ember-artline-is-amazons-answer-to-samsungs-the-frame-150015104.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is kicking off the new year by announcing a redesign of its Fire TV UI at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>. The new UI is designed to make finding things to watch on the platform faster, while making it easier to access more of Fire TV&#39;s features straight from the home screen.</p><p>On first blush, the biggest difference in the new Fire TV UI is that everything is rounder. Shows, movies and apps have rounded corners, and Amazon&#39;s changed the spacing in the interface to give everything more room to breathe. Tweaks to typography and color gradients also give the UI a more modern feel, and Amazon says it&#39;s rebuilt the code of the Fire TV software to make everything faster, too, in some cases demonstrating &quot;up to 20-30 percent gains in speed.&quot;</p><p>The fundamentals haven&#39;t changed all that much, however. There&#39;s a menu bar of different tabs at the top of the interface that separates the Home page from things like Movies, TV Shows and Sports. Each page shows content in carousels, and Amazon still lets you pin streaming apps like Netflix or Apple TV underneath recommended content, with the biggest difference being you can now pin more apps at once (20 rather than six). Amazon is also changing up how the Fire TV Remote works. Pressing the Menu button now lets you quickly access Fire TV&#39;s Art &amp; Photos, Games and Ambient Experience features, and a long press of the Home button pulls up a shortcut panel with access to things like settings and connected Ring cameras. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Alexa+</a>, Amazon&#39;s rebuilt AI assistant, is also available directly inside of the Fire TV interface for adding things to your watchlist, recommending content and controlling your smart home.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Fire-TV-mobile-app.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Fire-TV-mobile-app.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The redesigned Fire TV mobile app with access to content and browsing watchlists." data-uuid="5afe480c-fe8a-42f4-bd35-96401e6a6de8"/><figcaption>The new Fire TV mobile app can act as a remote and a way to search Amazon&#39;s library of content.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon offers the Fire TV mobile app as a way to control its streaming devices and TVs with a smartphone, but alongside this redesign, the company is also expanding what the app can do. The new Fire TV app lets you browse content, edit your watchlist and start playing things on your TV, in much the same way Roku and Google&#39;s streaming apps do.</p><p>Both the new Fire TV mobile app and redesigned Fire TV UI will be available for free for all users, Amazon says. The new Fire TV UI will launch in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, the second-generation Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED series. Later in the spring, Amazon says it will bring the redesign to more countries and devices, including the latest Fire TV 4K streaming devices, TVs like the Fire TV 2-series, 4-series and Fire TV Omni QLED series and TVs from third-party partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic and TCL.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/amazon-is-redesigning-its-fire-tv-ui-for-streaming-sticks-and-tvs-150000622.html?src=rss]]></description>

While not as expensive as an iPad or another flagship tablet, these e-paper devices can be more expensive than you think, but right now you can save on one of our favorites. Amazon&#39;s base <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0CNVCQZG1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e9865d5d-82c0-47b4-858f-2d61df88bf8c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FtYXpvbi1LaW5kbGUvZHAvQjBDTlZDUVpHMT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlOTg2NWQ1ZC04MmMwLTQ3YjQtODU4Zi0yZDYxZGY4OGJmOGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vQW1hem9uLUtpbmRsZS9kcC9CMENOVkNRWkcxIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARwL4yr9OWUmLZ8hMMGdyB_Y6VDLKvXaTHkB9-pMzWND&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Kindle%2Fdp%2FB0CNVCQZG1" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1">Kindle</a> is on sale for $90 — that&#39;s $20 less than usual and only $10 more than its record-low price.</p> 
<p>This made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html">best ereaders</a>, and for good reason. It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="feed13a4ff304bf1a5611d4015f6cd38" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>
