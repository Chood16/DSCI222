<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-wireless-charger">What to look for in a wireless charger</h2> 
<p>While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">3-in-1 wireless charger</a> or full wireless charging station.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-where-and-how-will-you-use-your-charger">Where and how will you use your charger?</h2>

<p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours.</p> 
<p>For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-charging-performance">Wireless charging performance</h2> 
<p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility.</p> 
<p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p> 
<p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DGJ4QQ5W&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1fe3d1e8-55e1-40d5-a463-1336dd916f19&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=latest+MagSafe+charging+pad&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1hZ1NhZmUtQ2hhcmdlci1DYXBhYmlsaXR5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjBER0o0UVE1Vy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWZlM2QxZTgtNTVlMS00MGQ1LWE0NjMtMTMzNmRkOTE2ZjE5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1hZ1NhZmUtQ2hhcmdlci1DYXBhYmlsaXR5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjBER0o0UVE1Vy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf2JDWR8j2ixl2Us5tU8PS-hr3dpnlftRDq8cDXA8Pwd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ4QQ5W%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible/dp/B0DGJ4QQ5W/">latest MagSafe charging pad</a> can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can.</p>

<p>Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link.</p> 
<p>Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs.</p> 
<p>You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-chargers-faqs">Wireless chargers FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-wireless-chargers-work-if-you-have-a-phone-case">Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case?</h3> 
<p>Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-know-if-my-phone-supports-wireless-charging">How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging?</h3> 
<p>Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.”</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-cords-charge-your-phone-faster">Do cords charge your phone faster?</h3> 
<p>Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss]]></description>

Her name may not be familiar to you, but her contributions certainly are; West&#39;s work laid the foundation for the global positioning system.

</div><p>West was born in 1930 in Virginia. Despite the oppression of Jim Crow laws in the south, she was able to pursue higher education at Virginia State College (now named Virginia State University), obtaining bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees in mathematics. In 1956, West was hired at what is now called the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, VA. Her focus during the 1970s and 1980s was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.war.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/article/3700859/navy-scientist-helped-develop-gps/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">creating</a> accurate models of the Earth&#39;s shape based on satellite data, a complex task requiring the type of mathematical gymnastics that would make the average person dizzy. Those models later became the backbone for GPS. West worked at the Dahlgren center for 42 years, retiring in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>As has been the case with so many of the women, particularly those of color, behind tech and science breakthroughs in the US, West&#39;s work went largely uncelebrated for decades. After submitting a short biography of her accomplishments to a sorority function in 2018, members of Alpha Kappa Alpha helped West to receive belated recognition for her contributions. She was inducted into the US Air Force Space and Missiles Pioneers Hall of Fame and honored as Female Alumna of the Year by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Awards in that same year. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/19/gladys-west-the-hidden-figure-who-helped-invent-gps" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a> published an interview with West in 2020 that shared some insights on her journey, including a note that when West was out and about, she favored paper maps over the technology she indirectly helped create.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/dr-gladys-west-whose-mathematical-models-inspired-gps-dies-at-95-234605023.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ASUS appears to be shifting its business operations away from smartphones. According to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/asus-confirms-it-wont-launch-phones-in-2026-may-leave-android-altogether?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&amp;test_variant=A" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">translations</a> of recent quotes from Chairman Jonney Shih, the company does not plan to release new phone models in the future. The chairman did not confirm whether smartphones would be completely phased out, but he did acknowledge that possibility. Whatever direction ASUS takes, its existing phones will continue to receive software updates and warranty assistance. Shih suggested that its future plans may include a shift into AI-related projects such as robotics or smartglasses.</p><p>Previous <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260102PD236/smartphone-asus-taiwan-mobile-market.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reports</a> hinted that ASUS would not introduce any smartphones in 2026, but Shih&#39;s recent comments indicate that the pause may stretch longer than a year. We&#39;ve reached out to ASUS for additional comment and will update if the company shares any further information.&nbsp;</p><p>ASUS had plenty of other updates emerging from CES at the start of the month unrelated to smartphones, such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-asus-zenbook-duo-got-a-fantastic-redesign-for-ces-2026-173000392.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">dual-screen</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">laptops</a> and a pair of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">gaming smartglasses</a>. So if it does decide to leave that product segment, there will still be other ASUS-branded gear on the market. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/asus-will-not-release-any-new-smartphones-this-year-213043832.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK Gambling Commission has raised concerns that Meta is ignoring advertisements by illegal gambling websites on its platforms. At a conference in Barcelona, the commission&#39;s Executive Director Tim Miller criticized Meta&#39;s behavior towards advertisements for online gambling on its Facebook and Instagram social networks.</p><p>&quot;Companies like Meta will tell you that they don’t tolerate the advertising of illegal sites and will remove them if they are notified about them,&quot; Miller&#39;s speech transcript <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/ice-barcelona-2026-tim-miller-speech" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reads</a>. &quot;But that approach suggests that they don’t know about those ads unless alerted. That is simply false.&quot;</p><p>Meta&#39;s internal <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=58a137b8-4748-4ad2-b1db-003c79a332f5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ffc49933-c6b0-4df4-92f7-55ecc8fe6659&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Facebook&amp;linkText=policy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaGVscC80NzQwMzI1OTg5MzQwODU2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZmM0OTkzMy1jNmIwLTRkZjQtOTJmNy01NWVjYzhmZTY2NTkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWxwLzQ3NDAzMjU5ODkzNDA4NTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVBrJifMvrdqBaSigqxQPN0_eYolx603g6lnq0KR_QZI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F4740325989340856" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Facebook;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/4740325989340856">policy</a> is that gambling sites must be licensed in the markets where their ads run. However, the agency was able to conduct basic searches for advertisers that are not on its GamStop platform, which helps people block themselves from accessing online gambling sites. GamStop integration is required for an operator to receive a UK license.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I would be very surprised if Meta, as one of the world’s largest tech companies is incapable of proactively using their own keyword facility to prevent the advertising of illegal gambling,&quot; Miller said. &quot;It could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking money from criminals and scammers until someone shouts about it.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/uk-agency-questions-metas-policies-for-illegal-gambling-site-ads-210500714.html?src=rss]]></description>

Alongside a definitive release date, Bungie shared a new gameplay trailer, in addition to details about the game&#39;s forthcoming deluxe edition, which fans can pre-order today on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. All versions of the game will support crossplay, meaning you&#39;ll be able to play with your friends, no matter where they decide to buy <em>Marathon</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Sony, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buy-bungie-destiny-studio-180905449.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Bungie&#39;s parent company</a>, had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-in-march-200838426.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">previously committed to a March release</a> for <em>Marathon</em>, but stopped short of sharing an exact date.

This came after the company said it would take more direct control of Bungie. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2013034224828215706"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that Tesla will be restarting work on Dojo3, the third generation of its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-autonomous-driving-091123615.html"><ins>in-house supercomputer project</ins></a>. The Dojo team had been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/tesla-shuts-down-in-house-dojo-ai-supercomputer-project-155420734.html"><ins>disbanded last year</ins></a> as the company prioritized the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-wins-165-billion-deal-to-make-teslas-ai6-chips-124515017.html"><ins>AI chips</ins></a> that run on board Tesla vehicles. Musk said the company is returning to the project &quot;now that the AI5 chip design is in good shape.&quot;</p>
<p>The purpose of the Dojo project is to process video recordings and other data from Tesla vehicles and use that <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-autonomous-driving-091123615.html"><ins>to train</ins></a> the &quot;neural net&quot; behind the company&#39;s Full Self-Driving software. Last year, however, Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1953660184351707210"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that &quot;It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs. The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AI chips Musk is referring to are ones <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-02-tesla-is-quietly-making-its-own-ai-chip-for-self-driving-cars.html"><ins>developed for running FSD</ins></a> onboard Tesla vehicles and are not optimized for training. The AI6 chips will be <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-wins-165-billion-deal-to-make-teslas-ai6-chips-124515017.html"><ins>made by Samsung</ins></a> in the company&#39;s Texas factory, after it struck a $16 billion agreement with Tesla.</p>
<p>Musk has also claimed a lot of things over the years, and many of those assertions either were misrepresentations or simply didn&#39;t pan out. Working against this chip project: Musk <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2012756384559817033"><ins>said</ins></a> that Dojo3 will be &quot;space-based AI compute,&quot; as he <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=55d30955-bdc6-4ff8-adb4-b5acdd5e0c7e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=and+others+believe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAxLzAxL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvc3BhY2UtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXJzLWFpLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU1ZDMwOTU1LWJkYzYtNGZmOC1hZGI0LWI1YWNkZDVlMGM3ZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyNi8wMS8wMS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NwYWNlLWRhdGEtY2VudGVycy1haS5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYdqHii_Sg1J6lzzAMVxJwwBpWHC-lQ7JcYLygXHz0fw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F01%2F01%2Ftechnology%2Fspace-data-centers-ai.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/01/technology/space-data-centers-ai.html"><ins>and others believe</ins></a> that <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/ai-spacex-elon-musk-data-centers"><ins>data centers in orbit</ins></a> are a superior alternative to the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-announces-huge-new-data-centers-but-they-could-gobble-up-millions-of-gallons-of-water-per-day-174000478.html"><ins>land-based behemoths</ins></a> currently being built.

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from the usual $160, and League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. Considering we&#39;re almost halfway though the season, the discount makes sense and is a good deal for anyone who wants to keep a close eye on the rest of the games to be played this year.</p> 
<p>The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Last year, League Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html">added multiview</a>, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.</p> 
<p>Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.</p>

Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D54JZTHY&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=24b60c33-f851-4bee-9d8b-9c00c8cc034a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=AirTags&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRiNjBjMzMtZjg1MS00YmVlLTlkOGItOWMwMGM4Y2MwMzRhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR-tHxD_n-S9V6FZTggBPzQxNCDZMIugRbDnHNS6azZ_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?">AirTags</a> for $65.

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta’s Threads is pulling further ahead of Elon Musk’s X on mobile, based on recent estimates from analytics firm Similarweb, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2026/01/16/threads-widens-lead-over-musks-x-zuckerbergs-platform-adds-millions/"><em><ins>Forbes</ins></em></a> reports. In the first stretch of January, Threads averaged roughly 143 million daily active users worldwide on mobile devices, compared with about 126 million for X.</p>
<p>Similarweb’s year-over-year snapshot shows <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-reaches-150-million-daily-users-and-is-ramping-up-ads-214259945.html"><ins>Threads growing sharply</ins></a>, up 37.8 percent year-over-year, while X’s daily mobile audience fell 11.9 percent across the same period. The picture is more mixed in the US, where X still holds a narrow edge on mobile. Similarweb data puts X at about 21.2 million daily active US mobile users in early January versus roughly 19.5 million for Threads.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, Threads’ US mobile usage has risen substantially faster over the past year, surging almost 42 percent to X&#39;s 18 percent. X remains far larger on desktop, where it draws around 150 million daily users or visits worldwide, while Threads’ web presence sits at just 9 million.</p>
<p>Forbes also reported on Similarweb data for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-and-threads-showed-us-very-different-visions-for-a-post-x-future-171046336.html"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a>, another competing text-based platform started by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. Dorsey left the board in the summer of 2024, later telling <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/interview-with-jack-dorsey-mike-solana"><em><ins>Pirate Wires</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>he believed Bluesky was &quot;literally repeating all the mistakes we made as a company,&quot; in reference to Twitter. The social network opened registrations in 2024, and sits now with a daily mobile user base of 3.6 million, which Similarweb says is down 44.4 percent year-over-year.</p>
<p>X has found itself in hot water yet again over xAI&#39;s Grok chatbot, which was altering pictures of women on the platform to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html"><ins>create lewd images</ins></a> at the request of users without the consent of those pictured. In some cases, the chatbot also altered the images of underage girls. The <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html"><ins>uproar in response</ins></a> led the company to shut off image generation for nonsubscribers and place firmer guardrails on what types of images can be generated. The delayed action came after weeks of Grok creating tens of thousands of these images, and after the Attorney General of California <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai"><ins>launched an investigation</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-has-more-global-daily-users-than-x-on-mobile-for-the-first-time-144936831.html?src=rss]]></description>

You can whip one out at a party or event and take a snap, then a couple of minutes later you have a real, physical, instant photo that everyone can touch, feel and enjoy instead of staring at a screen. It’s also a lot cooler than a smartphone shot thanks to the retro, nostalgic vibes of analog photography.<br><br>Given the large number of camera brands on the market, choosing one can be tricky. That’s why we’ve put together this buying guide that will help you choose the best instant camera for you based on factors like price, instant film size, photo quality and more.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-an-instant-camera">What to consider before buying an instant camera</h2> 
<p>The main factor for most people is the size of the film. When most people think of retro instant cameras, they think of a square image size. That’s why Instagram, which used to have a Polaroid-like app icon, only supported square images for years. If that’s what you want, then Fuji’s Square or either of Polaroid’s formats are best.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>However, if you want as large an image as possible, Fujifilm’s Instax wide is the way to go. For those who prefer a smaller size to pin on their fridge or slip in an envelope (or the cheaper film), Fujifilim’s Instax Mini or Polaroid’s Go format are best.</p> 
<p>With that in mind, here are the choices. Fujifilm’s Instax alone offers three formats: Mini, Square and Wide, with film sizes of 3.4 x 2.1 inches, 3.4 x 2.8 inches and 3.4 x 4.3 inches. The corresponding image sizes are 2.44 x 1.81 inches, 2.44 x 2.44 inches and 2.44 x 3.9 inches.</p> 
<p>Leica’s Sofort 2 and Lomography models also uses Fujifilm’s Mini format, while Polaroid’s smaller Go format is 2.64 x 2.13 inches (1.81 x 1.83-inch image) and its i-Type size is 3.46 x 4.21 inches, with a square image size of 3.11 x 3.11 inches.</p> 
<p>As for prices, Fujifilm’s Instax films are generally around $1 - $1.20 per shot for square or wide color film and $.60 - $.75 for mini color film. Those prices go up a bit if you choose custom models with colorful or patterned borders, and down if you buy in bulk. Polaroid’s i-Type film is a bit more at about $2.00 per shot or $1.00 - $1.35 per shot for Go color film.</p> 
<p>Image quality isn’t really the point with instant cameras of course, as they’re always going to be fuzzy compared to digital photos. However, some models (notably Fujifilm and Polaroid models) are a bit better than others.</p> 
<p>And in terms of pricing for the cameras themselves, models with larger film are generally more expensive. It also increases if you add hybrid features like USB-C connectivity, smartphone sharing, the ability to print out photos and more, along with niceties like a selfie mirror. The best, most feature-laden cameras can cost upwards of $200 and basic versions can be well under $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-instant-camera-120034778.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That's 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-180602104.html?src=rss]]></description>

The latest &quot;out-of-band&quot; update repairs an issue for some Windows 11 devices that would only restart when users tried to shut down or hibernate. The same update restores the ability for Windows 10 and Windows 11 users to log into their devices via remote connection apps.</p>
<p>Microsoft said the inability to shut down or hibernate affected Windows 11 devices using Secure Launch, a security feature that protects a computer from firmware-level attacks during startup. As for the remote connection issue, Microsoft explained in its <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-server-2025#3760msgdesc">Known issues page</a> that credential prompt failures were responsible when users tried to log in remotely to affected Windows 10 and 11 devices.</p>

That&#39;s a dollar per month. This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21.</p> 
<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>

The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Washington state residents may soon be forced to produce IDs before getting onto websites with pornographic content. Within the state&#39;s House of Representatives, Rep. Mari Leavitt introduced <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?BillNumber=2112&amp;Year=2025&amp;Initiative=false">House Bill 2112</a>, which is informally known as the Keep Our Children Safe Act. Similar to the initiatives seen in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/louisiana-government-id-to-access-porn-online-065536172.html">other states</a>, the bill proposes to restrict access to &quot;online sexual material harmful&quot; to anyone under 18.</p>
<p>In practical terms, those living in Washington state could see websites asking for digital identification or demanding the user go through an age verification system that requests a government-issued ID. If a website that has more than one-third of its content being &quot;sexual material harmful to minors&quot; is found not following these rules, the state&#39;s attorney general can pursue steep civil penalties.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If those restrictions sound familiar, it&#39;s because many <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">other states</a> have also passed similar constraints. Washington state&#39;s proposed bill is very similar to Texas&#39; age verification law that went into effect in September 2023 and was recently upheld by the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/supreme-court-upholds-texass-porn-site-age-verification-law-155007840.html">US Supreme Court</a>. Like the Texas law, several groups expressed disapproval of the bill during the public hearing at the House committee level. As reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-age-verification-bill-targets-access-to-online-adult-content/"><em>The Seattle Times</em></a><em>, </em>groups including the ACLU, Lavender Rights Project and the Northwest Progressive Institute warned of privacy risks related to potential data breaches and the loose definition of &quot;sexual material harmful to minors&quot; in the bill&#39;s language.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/washington-is-the-latest-state-pursuing-an-age-verification-law-for-porn-sites-174423529.html?src=rss]]></description>

To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a>, one of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">Engadget&#39;s favorite budgeting apps</a>, for just $50 if you use code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout and you&#39;re a new subscriber. That&#39;s a 50 percent discount on the service&#39;s normal $100 price.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarch.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The peak time for deals on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That&#39;s $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

The Las Vegas deal ultimately &quot;didn&#39;t come to fruition,&quot; spokesperson Sara Collins told<em> </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Las Vegas Sun</em></a> this week, and Atari Hotels is putting its focus into the Phoenix site &quot;for the time being.&quot;</p><p>Phoenix was always meant to be the first site, followed by other hotels in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. But Las Vegas is now apparently off the table, and there haven&#39;t been any signs of life around the other planned locations. The FAQ on the Atari Hotels website notes, &quot;Additional sites, including Denver, are being explored under separate development and licensing agreements.&quot; The Atari Hotel project was announced in 2020 just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and consequently experienced development delays. Construction on the Phoenix hotel, which was supposed to break ground in 2020, is expected to begin late this year, with its opening now planned for 2028.&nbsp;</p><p>But maybe don&#39;t hold your breath. According to a December press release, the company is still trying to raise $35 million to $40 million to fund the &quot;playable destination&quot; for gamers in Phoenix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-plan-for-a-gaming-themed-atari-hotel-in-las-vegas-has-reportedly-been-scrapped-214212269.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is reportedly adding Teresa Palmer (<em>The Fall Guy, Warm Bodies, Hacksaw Ridge</em>) to its pantheon of Norse gods for its <em>God of War</em> TV show adaptation. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, Palmer will play Sif, Thor&#39;s wife and eventual leader of the Aesir, in the live-action adaptation. It may not carry as much weight as the casting of the video game&#39;s protagonist that was revealed earlier this week to be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html">Ryan Hurst</a>, but it could hint at the direction the TV show may take.</p>

<p>While Sif plays a minor role in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a> game, the early casting confirmation could indicate that the showrunner, Ronald D. Moore, may give the character a more involved role. In <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, Sif is known as Odin&#39;s diplomat before the events of Ragnarok, where she becomes the new leader of the Aesir, one of two tribes of Norse gods. Notably, Amazon&#39;s adaptation is still missing the casting confirmations for Atreus, Thor, Odin and many other Norse gods seen in the video game. Even so, the <em>God of War</em> TV show has already secured at least <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/amazons-god-of-war-adaptation-gets-a-two-season-order-133059803.html">two seasons</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In another attempt to reduce our attention spans to mush, TikTok has released the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinedrama/id6754134922">PineDrama</a> app, which offers serialized drama series that are roughly a minute per episode. As first spotted by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-launches-a-new-micro-drama-app-called-pinedrama-2026-1"><em>Business Insider</em></a>, the app is designed exactly like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html">TikTok</a>, but instead of trendy dance videos, you can scroll through and watch &quot;micro dramas.&quot;</p>
<p>For those new to the category, micro dramas are bite-sized TV shows shot in vertical video and available in minute-long episodes. Don&#39;t expect any nominations for Best Original Screenplay with series like <em>The Officer Fell For Me </em>or<em> Married to my past life&#39;s nemesis</em>, since they typically offer soap opera vibes with cliffhangers that keep users scrolling to the next episode. The app is designed to keep people on it with a Discover tab, a place to save favorites and the ability to react in real time alongside other viewers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Right now, the micro dramas on PineDrama are all free to watch and don&#39;t have any ads. It&#39;s unclear if TikTok will introduce any costs or ads to the app, since other micro drama options like DramaBox or ReelShort have a paid structure. Late last year, TikTok also introduced a way to watch micro dramas within its own app, with a section called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-jumps-into-micro-dramas-buzzy-bite-sized-soaps-2025-12">Minis</a>. It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;re seeing shorter TV show formats, since Quibi made waves with a format of episodes that were less than 10 minutes long.

The savings vary depending on the bundle you configure, but this can bring your out-the-door cost down to $449 from $529 for the tablet, Marker stylus and polymer weave book folio. The offer runs through January 17.</p> 
<p>The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">best e-ink tablet</a>. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-tablet-e-ink-hands-on-review-marker-writing-note-taking-130044070.html">review</a>, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable.</p> 
<p>The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn&#39;t think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless.</p> 
<p>The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges.</p> 
<p>The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet. The pricier tablet also has bundle deals right now with savings up to $80 depending on configuration.</p>

As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the latest filing, as part of a lawsuit that accuses the AI giant of abandoning its non-profit status, claims that Musk is owed anywhere between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages from the &quot;wrongful gains&quot; of OpenAI and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Musk claimed in the filing that he&#39;s entitled to a portion of OpenAI&#39;s recent valuation at <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-private-company-at-500-billion-133028221.html">$500 billion</a>, after contributing $38 million in &quot;seed funding&quot; during the AI company&#39;s startup years. Along with providing &quot;roughly 60 percent of the nonprofit&#39;s seed funding,&quot; Musk offered recruiting of key employees, introductions with business contacts and startup advice, according to the filing. The monetary estimate comes from C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist who&#39;s serving as Musk&#39;s expert in the case. According to Wazzan&#39;s calculations, OpenAI earned between $65.5 billion and $109.43 billion in wrongful gains, while Microsoft saw between $13.3 billion and $25.06 billion.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AirPods work most smoothly with Apple hardware, but they also connect reliably to Android phones, Windows laptops and other Bluetooth devices. The pairing process depends on the platform in use although the basics remain the same. Once the AirPods are placed in pairing mode, most devices detect them quickly and handle the remaining steps in the background. The guide below explains how to pair AirPods with Apple products, how the process differs on newer iPhones that support H2 features and how to connect them to non-Apple devices.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pair-airpods-with-apple-devices">How to pair AirPods with Apple devices</h2><p>Apple builds AirPods to pair almost instantly with devices in its own ecosystem. Opening the charging case near an unlocked iPhone or iPad usually brings up an on-screen prompt. Tapping <strong>Connect</strong> links the earbuds to the device and to every other Apple product signed into the same iCloud account. After that, switching between devices is automatic. Audio output follows the active device as long as each product is using updated software and is signed in with the same Apple ID.</p><p>If the pairing prompt does not appear, there are a few simple checks that help things move along. Opening the <strong>Control Center</strong> and selecting the audio output menu confirms whether the AirPods already appear as an available device. If they are listed there, choosing them establishes the connection. If they do not appear, opening the <strong>Settings</strong> app and checking <strong>Bluetooth</strong> usually reveals whether the AirPods are in range or already recognized. Opening the case while viewing the Bluetooth menu often triggers the pairing card once more.</p><p>The process is similar across Apple Watch and Mac. When the AirPods are already linked to an iPhone, they tend to show up automatically on a paired Apple Watch. On Mac, opening <strong>System Settings</strong> and viewing the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> section reveals the same device list seen on an iPhone. Selecting the AirPods from that list completes the connection and also syncs the pairing status back to every other Apple device using the same account.</p><h2 id="jump-link-enhanced-pairing-with-newer-iphones">Enhanced pairing with newer iPhones</h2><p>Some newer iPhones support features enabled by the H2 chip used in newer AirPods models. With compatible AirPods, models such as iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and the iPhone 16 lineup tend to deliver a faster and more responsive setup experience. When an AirPods case is opened near one of these phones, the device quickly detects the earbuds and displays the pairing card with little delay. This also tends to speed up transitions between devices and improves reliability when switching audio sources.</p><p>If the fast pairing prompt does not appear on a newer iPhone, reopening the case while the phone is unlocked is usually enough to reinitiate the process. It also helps to confirm that Bluetooth is turned on. Placing the AirPods back in the case for a few seconds and trying again will often reset the pairing state if the earbuds were connected elsewhere.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/fc3e54e0-c61d-11f0-a4db-6ace49d303da" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/fc3e54e0-c61d-11f0-a4db-6ace49d303da" style="height:1347px;width:2560px;" alt="AirPods Pro 3" data-uuid="ae83d4b4-39cf-36ff-9422-72c881ba45e2"/><figcaption>AirPods Pro 3</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-put-airpods-into-pairing-mode">How to put AirPods into pairing mode</h2><p>Every AirPods model supports a manual pairing mode. This is essential when linking the earbuds to devices outside the Apple ecosystem, or when the automatic prompt fails to appear on an iPhone or Mac.   On older AirPods models, pairing mode is activated by opening the lid and pressing and holding the setup button on the back of the case until the LED light flashes white. Newer models, including AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 3, use a touch-based method instead. With the lid open, tapping the area near the LED light places the earbuds into pairing mode. Leaving the lid open keeps the AirPods discoverable for nearby devices. Closing the case ends the process and requires it to be repeated if the device fails to detect them.</p><p>Pairing mode does not remove any previous connections. It simply makes the AirPods available to new devices, which is helpful when switching between ecosystems. However, connecting to a new device usually takes priority. If the AirPods are already linked to something else that is nearby, turning off Bluetooth on the previously connected device prevents interference and helps the new device detect them more easily.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pair-airpods-with-android-devices">How to pair AirPods with Android devices</h2><p>Although AirPods are designed for Apple hardware, they function like any other Bluetooth earbuds on Android. Opening the case and placing the AirPods in pairing mode allows Android phones to detect them through the standard <strong>Bluetooth</strong> menu. The earbuds appear in the list of available devices and selecting them initiates the connection. Once paired, AirPods work for calls and media playback. Some features, such as automatic ear detection and battery status indicators, may require a third-party app on Android and are not supported at a system level. Features such as spatial audio and device switching remain exclusive to Apple’s ecosystem but day-to-day performance is consistent on Android.</p><p>If the AirPods fail to appear, refreshing the Bluetooth device list on the Android phone usually helps. Making sure the earbuds are still in pairing mode is essential since the white LED indicator stops flashing after a short period. Reopening the case and holding the button again, or tapping on the front for newer models, restores discoverability.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-pair-airpods-with-windows-laptops">How to pair AirPods with Windows laptops</h2><p>Windows 11 handles AirPods as a regular audio device. Opening the <strong>Bluetooth and Devices</strong> menu in <strong>System Settings</strong> displays a list of nearby accessories. With the AirPods in pairing mode, the laptop should detect them and display them as an audio device. Selecting them completes the process and adds the earbuds to the device’s known accessories. Windows generally reconnects to AirPods automatically on future sessions as long as Bluetooth remains enabled.</p><p>If the earbuds do not appear in the list, toggling Bluetooth off and back on helps the system refresh the device scan. Checking whether the AirPods are already linked to a different device is another useful step. Windows sometimes struggles to take over a connection when the earbuds remain in range of a previously paired phone so disabling Bluetooth on the other device often resolves the issue.</p><h2 id="jump-link-troubleshooting-common-pairing-issues">Troubleshooting common pairing issues</h2><p>Most pairing problems come down to the AirPods not being in discoverable mode or being connected to another device nearby. Resetting the earbuds solves many problems. On AirPods models with a setup button, placing the AirPods in the case, leaving the lid open and holding the button until the LED turns amber then white restores the factory pairing state. On newer models without a physical button, place the AirPods in the case, close the lid for about 30 seconds, then open it and quickly tap the front of the case three times. The status light should then flash amber and then white, to indicate that the reset is complete. This clears previous connections and makes the AirPods behave as if they are new out of the box.&nbsp;</p><p>Low battery levels can also interrupt pairing. Ensuring both the earbuds and the case have enough charge prevents unexpected disconnections during setup. Interference from other wireless accessories affects pairing on crowded networks. Moving to a quieter spot or turning off surrounding Bluetooth devices helps the AirPods stand out when scanning.</p><p>AirPods are built to pair quickly with Apple devices but they also integrate smoothly with other platforms. Keeping the earbuds in pairing mode and confirming that Bluetooth is enabled on the device in use ensures a smooth setup every time. Once connected, the AirPods tend to remember the device and reconnect whenever they are nearby which keeps day-to-day use simple regardless of the platform.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-pair-airpods-with-any-device-140000234.html?src=rss]]></description>

However, even an expert review is subjective, and there&#39;s a chance CyberGhost will not work for you. If that’s the case, here&#39;s how to cancel your subscription.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-stop-your-cyberghost-subscription-renewing"><strong>How to stop your CyberGhost subscription renewing</strong></h2><p>Cancelling your CyberGhost subscription won&#39;t end it right away, unless you delete your account or get the refund (I&#39;ll explain how to do both of those later). Instead, the way to cancel CyberGhost is to stop your subscription from renewing at the end of each billing period. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can keep using CyberGhost until your current period ends.</p><p>The following steps will cancel auto-renewal if you got CyberGhost through its website. If you bought it through an app store instead, see the next section.</p><ol><li><p>Open your browser and go to <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eb43eed0-f954-43d3-964f-bfeb8e845bd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViNDNlZWQwLWY5NTQtNDNkMy05NjRmLWJmZWI4ZTg0NWJkOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAU-Gf6nZo62L9GIIKc76mweGLaqSbTDQX2mLoNjPWUrb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>At the top-right of the screen, click the box labeled <strong>My Account</strong>.

The next time you would have been billed, your subscription will expire. You can resubscribe by purchasing another term.

If you bought CyberGhost through an app store and want to cancel, you&#39;ll have to ask the app store in question, not CyberGhost. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p><p>If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, you&#39;ll need to cancel through your Apple ID. Here are the steps.</p><ol><li><p>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your home screen.</p></li><li><p>At the top of the Settings menu, you&#39;ll see your name.

If you don&#39;t, you might still be charged for the subscription you&#39;re not using, and it&#39;s a huge hassle to end that without an account.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve done that, log into your account on <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eb43eed0-f954-43d3-964f-bfeb8e845bd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViNDNlZWQwLWY5NTQtNDNkMy05NjRmLWJmZWI4ZTg0NWJkOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAU-Gf6nZo62L9GIIKc76mweGLaqSbTDQX2mLoNjPWUrb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a> and click on your account profile at the top-right, just like when you canceled auto-renewal.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. Several neat-looking games arrived this week, we got release dates for several others that I&#39;m <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heist-game-relooted-gets-a-release-date-173456541.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">really looking forward to</a> and a brand-new Steam festival was announced.&nbsp;</p><p>The Love, Romance, and Heartbreak Debutante Ball is said to be the first Valentine&#39;s Day-themed Steam festival. It&#39;ll run from February 13 to 20 and feature more than 100 games, including discounts and demos. A showcase will take place on February 13 at 1PM ET on the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHFkzHblsQfyuQF-mR-MPA" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Sunny Demeanor Games YouTube channel</a> too.</p><p>Organizers say the festival includes a wide variety of games about love, including RPGs, puzzle games and (naturally) visual novels. You might play as a cat or someone trying to fish an engagement ring out of a claw machine, as a secret agent or a couple that&#39;s run off to another planet. I&#39;m intrigued! There will be some NSFW games involved, for what it&#39;s worth.</p><h2 id="jump-link-new-releases">New releases</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn1pi1UKJXc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check </em>seems like a 3D version of <em>Papers Please</em> but with zombies. At a checkpoint amid a zombie outbreak, your mission is to screen survivors for signs of infection. If you&#39;re unsure of their status, you can send an individual to quarantine for further observation or a lab for additional screening. Otherwise, you can let them in or send them to &quot;liquidation.&quot; Get things wrong and it could spell disaster, but at least you have a sidearm (and a weaponized drone) to help you deal with sticky situations.</p><p>It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check,</em> which is from Brigada Games and publisher Devolver Digital. There are base and resource management aspects as well. It&#39;s out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam</a> (usually $20, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until January 26) and PC Game Pass.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1c9juK-z7Fw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Air Hares</em> seems to draw inspiration from classic top-down shoot-&#39;em-ups. But instead of simply blowing up countless ships, your mission is to restore farmland. You&#39;ll fire seeds and water to turn barren land into fertile carrot fields. There are still enemies to contend with — you (and perhaps a co-op partner) can dodge and ram them as you try to protect the land.&nbsp;Expect boss battles, too.</p><p>I really like the aesthetic here. It has a &#39;90s-style cartoon look (I suddenly really want a modern Bucky O&#39;Hare game). Also, the song from the trailer is going to live in my head for weeks.</p><p>Husband-and-wife team Tim and Megan Bungeroth created <em>Air Hares </em>over six years with the help of several contributors. According to a press release, the game is &quot;inspired by the creators’ personal journey with infertility and the idea of creating life rather than destroying it.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Air Hares</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Steam</a>. It typically costs $9, but there&#39;s a 20 percent discount until January 28.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpEAiQ5BCqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Luckshot Games&#39; <em>Big Hops</em> looks like my kind of 3D platformer: joyous and playful. As a young frog who has been kidnapped, you&#39;ll try to find airship parts for a raccoon who has promised to help get you home.</p><p>There are tons of movement mechanics here, and Hop&#39;s tongue plays a major role in those. You can use it to swing across gaps, hookshot your way to higher platforms and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Big Hops</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221480/Big_Hops/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/big-hops-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016219" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">PS5</a> for $20.

You can rotate the world to discover new secrets and hide enemies and hazards from view so you can move past them. If you can&#39;t see something on your screen, it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s a bit of a <em>Fez </em>influence here, it would appear.</p><p>Wonderland Kazakiri and publisher Pocketpair are behind this one, which I&#39;m looking forward to checking out when I have a chance. <em>Cassette Boy </em>is available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Steam</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cassette-boy-switch/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Switch</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016744" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">PS4, PS5</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=65a90182-7193-42ba-8fdd-e43829c445b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+One+and+Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9jYXNzZXR0ZS1ib3kvOU5DTlJIS0cySDQ0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NWE5MDE4Mi03MTkzLTQyYmEtOGZkZC1lNDM4MjljNDQ1YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2Nhc3NldHRlLWJveS85TkNOUkhLRzJINDQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcgUS1P_S6SZc3gQOZUAPu-jnXaxMK7syPIPSyWIV-6w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fcassette-boy%2F9NCNRHKG2H44" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cassette-boy/9NCNRHKG2H44">Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S</a> for $13.</p><h2 id="jump-link-upcoming">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akOVT_R3QXY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-spooky-nes-platformer-more-n-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000259.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">I really enjoyed the demo</a> for <em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em> (as well as Aerial_Knight’s previous games).

You compete with four enemies to grab the only available parachute as you&#39;re falling through the air.

It&#39;s designed to be a playable cartoon (with a runtime of about eight hours) and it has an art style to match.&nbsp;</p><p>The cast is pretty stellar, with Ben Starr (<em>Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II</em>), Joel Fry (<em>Our Flag Means Death</em>) and a whole load of British comedy figures on board.

You can knock people off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, ram kids off of scooters, actually go skateboarding and, uh, cause havoc from above. In classic <em>THPS</em>-style, there are hidden areas too.&nbsp;</p><p>This looks like a fun distraction from [gestures at everything]. <em>Pie is the Sky</em> will swoop onto <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941360/Pie_in_the_Sky/" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">Steam</a> on February 2.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/papers-please-but-with-zombies-a-farming-based-shoot-em-up-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-123000437.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn&#39;t crack our top list above, but we&#39;re summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former&#39;s no-nonsense privacy and the latter&#39;s healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe&#39;s server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn&#39;t copy the most important part of Proton VPN&#39;s free plan — the unlimited data. You&#39;re only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn&#39;t enough for regular streaming. It&#39;s also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-private-internet-access"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=Private+Internet+Access&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb2xZhJgbuYJ1Fdt6xW-K50AZouRlBZmdjdZsNQwkI8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h3> 
<p>Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it&#39;s a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won&#39;t see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.</p> 
<p>PIA&#39;s apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html">PIA VPN review</a>.</p> 
<p>The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA&#39;s apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren&#39;t directly reflected in the speed tests. It&#39;s also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it&#39;s heavily bulked out by virtual locations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it&#39;s far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:VyprVPN;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1ac8eebf-61d7-4584-9f21-7053ac17ead1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=VyprVPN&amp;linkText=VyprVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52eXBydnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudnlwcnZwbi5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATWG0NqEJnfLwacpOW9Xap1dcDWgI9JL41k8O7ZSdLor&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vyprvpn.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn&#39;t crack the VPN encryption itself). It&#39;s also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn&#39;t make the top seven because its connection speeds aren&#39;t up to scratch — you&#39;ll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It&#39;s a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn&#39;t to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won&#39;t find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We&#39;re here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren&#39;t always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla&#39;s speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it&#39;s actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it&#39;s using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN&#39;s origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It&#39;s a dealbreaker if you can&#39;t figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you&#39;ll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it&#39;s available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you&#39;re comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vpn-faqs">VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>To wrap up, let&#39;s answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don&#39;t cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we&#39;re talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you&#39;re assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it&#39;s possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN&#39;s servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won&#39;t trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN&#39;s IP address, not yours. If you&#39;re interested in more detail, I&#39;ve written a whole article on <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">how a VPN works</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN&#39;s IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn&#39;t blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN&#39;s homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn&#39;t mean that authorities can&#39;t detect that it&#39;s being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It&#39;s no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there&#39;s nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you&#39;re using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can&#39;t do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that&#39;s concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there&#39;s very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before.</p> 
<p>All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html">secretly working off the same backend</a>. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you&#39;re free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google&#39;s One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you&#39;re a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don&#39;t recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

And it discounted compelling testimony from browser makers like Apple and Mozilla who said they choose to feature Google because it provides the highest quality search experience for their consumers.”</p><p>The company says that the requirement that it “provide syndication services to rivals” and share search data is a privacy risk and could “discourage competitors from building their own products.” Both remedies where compromises based on what the Justice Department originally proposed, which included <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/department-of-justice-confirms-that-it-wants-google-to-sell-off-chrome-094929822.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser</a>. </p><p>After <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">a 10-week trial</a> held in 2023, Google was found to have a search monopoly in 2024 because of the placement it maintained <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">as the default search engine</a> on multiple platforms, and the control it exerted over the ads that appear in search results.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CyberGhost is the middle child of the Kape Technologies VPN portfolio, but in quality, it&#39;s much closer to ExpressVPN than Private Internet Access. I mainly put it on my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPN</a> list because it&#39;s so cheap, but I wouldn&#39;t have done that if it didn&#39;t earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all.</p>
<p>My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that&#39;s not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that&#39;s not a bad thing — especially at such a low price.</p>
<p>Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it&#39;s got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I&#39;ll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-installing-configuring-and-using-cyberghost">Installing, configuring and using CyberGhost</h2>
<p>CyberGhost gets installation and UI largely right. There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don&#39;t overload you with needless information. I&#39;ve broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3>
<p>CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn&#39;t even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault.</p>

<p>Once inside, you&#39;re greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it&#39;s not broken, don&#39;t fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn&#39;t open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name.</p>
<p>To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can&#39;t argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3>
<p>The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It&#39;s best to download directly from <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5YzRlNDcwLTBkNDctNGY3OS1iYTg0LTRjNGMwOWE5ODdlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2N5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYX7tTagjB-oRngJXvg0K0XJtWIMFT26Kdu8C0caoEyb&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="http://cyberghostvpn.com"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghostvpn.com</a>, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers.</p>
<p>Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it&#39;s in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there&#39;s not much reason to ever leave it pinned.</p>

<p>The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it&#39;s permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list.</p>
<p>Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab.</p>

<p>Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn&#39;t give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-android">Android</h3>
<p>CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It&#39;s nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I&#39;d clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren&#39;t too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn&#39;t do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. &quot;Anonymous statistics&quot; and &quot;Share network data for troubleshooting&quot; sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting.</p>
<p>Still, I&#39;m nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost&#39;s Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren&#39;t necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3>
<p>Much like its Android app, CyberGhost&#39;s iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest.</p>

<p>The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3>
<p>CyberGhost doesn&#39;t have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won&#39;t find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location.</p>
<p>However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">how a VPN works</a>. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they&#39;re no substitute for a full VPN. They&#39;re free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don&#39;t get caught, but they aren&#39;t secure.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-speed-test">CyberGhost speed test</h2>
<p>I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here&#39;s what each metric means in the table below:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p><strong>Ping, </strong>measured in <strong>milliseconds (ms), </strong>is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Download speed, </strong>measured in <strong>megabits per second (Mbps), </strong>is what you probably think of as &quot;internet speed&quot; — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Upload speed, </strong>also measured in <strong>Mbps, </strong>determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It&#39;s useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls.</p></li>

<p>CyberGhost&#39;s speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost&#39;s 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Surfshark</a>, currently the fastest VPN overall.</p>

<p>Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s.</p>
<p>As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It&#39;s just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-security-test">CyberGhost security test</h2>
<p>VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it&#39;s using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it&#39;s being applied equally to all data packets. Let&#39;s get started.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3>
<p>CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. <strong>OpenVPN, </strong>available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. <strong>WireGuard, </strong>supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. <strong>IKEv2, </strong>which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn&#39;t open-source.</p>
<p>I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn&#39;t make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can&#39;t complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3>
<p>I used <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a> to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there&#39;s no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn&#39;t find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server&#39;s IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn&#39;t leaking.</p>
<p>There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It&#39;s annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you&#39;ll be fine.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3>
<p>For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-much-does-cyberghost-cost">How much does CyberGhost cost?</h2>
<p>CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" style="height:1576px;width:3418px;" alt="These prices are subject to change." data-uuid="99bfda39-6767-47ff-bcd8-00601369b0a7">
 <figcaption>

<p>One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That&#39;s still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-side-apps-and-bundles">CyberGhost side apps and bundles</h2>
<p>CyberGhost doesn&#39;t have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that&#39;s honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it&#39;s nice to see a VPN that&#39;s content with just being a VPN.</p>
<p>CyberGhost does have a broader &quot;security suite,&quot; but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the &quot;Extra features&quot; section below.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-dedicated-ip">Dedicated IP</h3>
<p>You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you&#39;ll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It&#39;s also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-close-reading-cyberghosts-privacy-policy">Close-reading CyberGhost&#39;s privacy policy</h2>
<p>CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It&#39;s not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That&#39;s a great start, but to be certain about a company&#39;s approach to privacy, it&#39;s best to look at its own words.</p>
<p>A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don&#39;t go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption.</p>
<p>When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it&#39;s not in their interest to lie outright in the document.</p>
<p>I went over CyberGhost&#39;s privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=here&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5cG9saWN5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM0ZTQ3MC0wZDQ3LTRmNzktYmE4NC00YzRjMDlhOTg3ZTciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tL3ByaXZhY3lwb2xpY3kifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASYbXwLN1vzWv2OcswQUEfLaywO4SqmgX5b_74w4QCmU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fprivacypolicy" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacypolicy">here</a> if you&#39;d like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of &quot;uncompromising protection&quot;: CyberGhost swears that &quot;<strong>we are NOT storing</strong> connection logs, meaning that <strong>we DON&#39;T have</strong> any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration&quot; (all emphasis theirs).</p>
<p>That&#39;s the standard I&#39;ll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let&#39;s see how it holds up.</p>
<figure>

<p>The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN.</p>
<p>Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are &quot;fraud detection/prevention&quot; and &quot;To enforce the terms of service,&quot; but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government.</p>
<p>The only potential problem comes in the section titled &quot;Sharing Your Personal Data.&quot; Here, CyberGhost states that &quot;we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,&quot; meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won&#39;t rehash the case against Kape in full — my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">ExpressVPN review</a> covers it in detail.</p>
<p>Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn&#39;t a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn&#39;t own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia.</p>
<p>Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won&#39;t share information with any entity not &quot;located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.&quot; Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn&#39;t have. It&#39;s not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn&#39;t a problem; it&#39;s just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it&#39;s located.</p>
<p>To sum up, I didn&#39;t see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I&#39;m confident that using this VPN doesn&#39;t risk your personal privacy.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-independent-corroboration">Independent corroboration</h3>
<p>CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=again+in+2024&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9wcml2YWN5aHViL3ByaXZhY3ktYXVkaXQtMjAyNC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5YzRlNDcwLTBkNDctNGY3OS1iYTg0LTRjNGMwOWE5ODdlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeWh1Yi9wcml2YWN5LWF1ZGl0LTIwMjQvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQqglCsIonIccFpaZHW6KnhW7P-QW7kU2nCRfgJGNXoY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fprivacyhub%2Fprivacy-audit-2024%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacyhub/privacy-audit-2024/">again in 2024</a>. Following that pattern, I&#39;ll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it&#39;s only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost&#39;s systems that conflicted with its privacy policy.</p>
<p>The audit notes CyberGhost&#39;s server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn&#39;t see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers.</p>
<p>CyberGhost also posts a regular <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c4e470-0d47-4f79-ba84-4c4c09a987e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;linkText=transparency+report&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS90cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktcmVwb3J0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM0ZTQ3MC0wZDQ3LTRmNzktYmE4NC00YzRjMDlhOTg3ZTciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZ2hvc3R2cG4uY29tL3RyYW5zcGFyZW5jeS1yZXBvcnQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbIOdcmaiBYXn6RqiuhzeQMEbgLLJjp-Y4S6KeT9EbvV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Ftransparency-report" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CyberGhost;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/transparency-report">transparency report</a> that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there&#39;s never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-can-cyberghost-change-your-virtual-location">Can CyberGhost change your virtual location?</h2>
<p>For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">virtual location changes</a> are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn&#39;t happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem.</p>
<p>Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below.</p>

<p>This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix&#39;s firewalls.

<h2 id="jump-link-investigating-cyberghosts-server-network">Investigating CyberGhost&#39;s server network</h2>
<p>CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost&#39;s VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That&#39;s good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are.</p>

<p>Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you&#39;re likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There&#39;s a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia.</p>

</figure>
<p>The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you&#39;re using CyberGhost in Argentina, don&#39;t expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it&#39;s actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost&#39;s support center does include <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/214495965-CyberGhost-VPN-s-Virtual-Server-Locations" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">a list</a> of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it&#39;s not up to date.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-extra-features-of-cyberghost">Extra features of CyberGhost</h2>
<p>CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">NordVPN</a>, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost&#39;s offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn&#39;t matter as much if the features work well. Let&#39;s see how they do.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-kill-switch">Kill switch</h3>
<p>CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it&#39;s fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired.</p>
<p>Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it&#39;s still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It&#39;s an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user&#39;s control.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3>
<p>Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds.</p>
<p>CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It&#39;s limited, but works as advertised.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-optimized-servers">Optimized servers</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: &quot;For gaming,&quot; &quot;For torrenting,&quot; &quot;For streaming&quot; and &quot;NoSpy.&quot; Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn&#39;t see much difference between them and the normal servers.</p>
<p>&quot;For torrenting&quot; is called &quot;For downloading&quot; on Mac, but it&#39;s all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great.</p>

 <div class="photo-credit">

 </div>
</figure>
<p>Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it&#39;s important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming.</p>
<p>Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost&#39;s own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who&#39;s running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That&#39;s relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn&#39;t insist on high standards from collaborators.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-content-blocker">Content blocker</h3>
<p>CyberGhost&#39;s content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There&#39;s no customization like you get with Windscribe&#39;s R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it&#39;s getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn&#39;t test it in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-smart-rules">Smart Rules</h3>
<p>The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost&#39;s features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost&#39;s behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_smart_rules.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_smart_rules.png" style="height:1441px;width:2424px;" alt="You can program CyberGhost to take different actions on each of your usual networks." data-uuid="d8ae2ccf-0ae8-4a19-8146-9e5a5c82c415">
 <figcaption>

 <div class="photo-credit">
  Sam Chapman for Engadget
 </div>
</figure>
<p>Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It&#39;s at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-customer-support-options">CyberGhost customer support options</h2>
<p>CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://support.cyberghostvpn.com" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">support.cyberghostvpn.com</a> or by going through the app. If you choose the options &quot;CyberGhost VPN help&quot; or &quot;FAQ&quot; in the app settings, you&#39;ll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page.</p>
<p>The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I&#39;m having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for &quot;connection issues macos&quot; turned up 72 results, including one called &quot;Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS&quot; and another titled &quot;Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.&quot; These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn&#39;t been checked since.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-live-support-experience">Live support experience</h3>
<p>If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://cyberghostvpnsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">a Zendesk portal</a>. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply.</p>
<p>Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://cyberghost.com" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">cyberghost.com</a> by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a &quot;CyberGhost AI Assistant&quot; (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don&#39;t — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn&#39;t working for them.</p>

<p>I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn&#39;t.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cyberghost-background-check">CyberGhost background check</h2>
<p>CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it&#39;s still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can&#39;t find much information about its history — it doesn&#39;t even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn&#39;t court controversy. Still, I&#39;m naturally paranoid, so I&#39;d understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN.</p>
<p>There is precisely one date in CyberGhost&#39;s history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn&#39;t measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a &quot;malware distributor&quot;; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector.</p>
<p>Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn&#39;t make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not here to defend Kape — I&#39;m just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn&#39;t backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape&#39;s consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">Private Internet Access</a>, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It&#39;s up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost&#39;s parent company presents a hard line you won&#39;t cross.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2>
<p>At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I&#39;m definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it&#39;s not pushing any envelopes, but it&#39;s cheap and it does the job.</p>
<p>All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It&#39;ll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss]]></description>

Anthropic launched Cowork as an exclusive feature for its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Max subscribers</a>, who pay a minimum of $100 per month for more uses of Claude&#39;s expensive reasoning models and early access to experimental features. Now Claude Cowork is available at a cheaper price, though Anthropic notes &quot;Pro users may hit their usage limits earlier&quot; than Max users do.</p><p>Like other AI agents, the novelty of Claude Cowork is its ability to work on its own. If you have the macOS Claude app and a Pro subscription, you can prompt Claude Cowork to work on tasks on your local computer, like creating documents based on files you have saved or organizing your folders. The feature is an evolution of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Claude Code</a>, Anthropic&#39;s AI coding agent, and can similarly use connectors and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Claude Chrome plugin</a> to work with other apps and the web.</p><p>As part of this expanded rollout, Anthropic has included a few fixes inspired by early user feedback. You&#39;ll now be able to rename sessions with Claude Cowork (&quot;Tasks&quot; in the parlance of the Claude app) and the company says the AI assistant will offer better file format previews, more reliable use of connectors to other apps and confirmation messages before it deletes files.</p><p>Coding agents top the list of applications of AI that have gained real traction in the last year, so Anthropic applying what it learned with Claude Code to a more general collection of computer tasks makes sense. Claude Cowork is still limited to macOS and Anthropic&#39;s paid subscribers, but assuming the AI agent continues to be popular, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if the company brought it to other platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-opens-up-its-claude-cowork-feature-to-anyone-with-a-20-subscription-194000021.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you follow Anthropic, you&#39;re probably familiar with Claude Code. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-is-letting-claude-ai-control-your-pc-181500127.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Since the fall of 2024</a>, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/blog/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRfApB7i3w$" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Claude Cowork</a>.</p><p>The company is billing Cowork as &quot;a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.&quot; After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. </p><p>Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that&#39;s easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" data-i13n="slk:Claude in Chrome;cpos:3;pos:1">Claude’s Chrome plugin</a> — and make can use Anthropic&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://claude.com/connectors" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Connectors framework</a> to access third-party apps like Canva. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&quot; However, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">does note</a> the system can &quot;take potentially destructive actions,&quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it&#39;s best to give &quot;very clear&quot; guidance to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">seemingly limited adoption</a>. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   </p><p>Anthropic briefly made Cowork preview only available to users of its pricey <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Claude Max</a> subscription. That changed on Friday when the company expanded access to include customers of its $20 per month Pro plan.  If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you&#39;ll need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. </p><p><strong>Update 01/16/26 2:30PM ET</strong>: Updated to reflect Claude Cowork is now also available to Claude Pro customers. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-launches-claude-cowork-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000849.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside of ChatGPT &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot; In a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post published Friday</a>, the company said adult users in the US of its free and Go tiers (more on the latter in a moment) would start seeing sponsored products and services appear below their conversations with its chatbot. &quot;Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer,&quot; OpenAI said, adding any sponsored spots would not influence the answers ChatGPT generates. &quot;Answers are optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI says people won&#39;t see ads appear when they&#39;re talking to ChatGPT about sensitive subjects like their health, mental state of mind or current politics. The company also won&#39;t show ads to teens under the age of 18. As for privacy, OpenAI states it won&#39;t share or sell your data with advertisers. The company will also give users the option to disable ad personalization and clear the data it uses to generate sponsored responses. &quot;We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,&quot; OpenAI adds. Users can dismiss ads, at which point they&#39;ll be asked to explain why they didn&#39;t engage with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/chatgpt-ads-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/chatgpt-ads-2.jpg" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about sponsored content. " data-uuid="17a47300-6434-42a8-af6e-84b62372379c"/><figcaption>Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about sponsored content. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OpenAI</div></figure><p>&quot;Given what AI can do, we&#39;re excited to develop new experiences over time that people find more helpful and relevant than any other ads. Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,&quot; OpenAI said. However, the company was also quick to note its &quot;long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for.&quot;</p><p>To that point, OpenAI said it would also make its ChatGPT Go subscription <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">available to users in the US</a>. The company first launched the tier in India last August, marketing it as a low-cost alternative to its more expensive Plus and Pro offerings. In the US, Go will cost $8 per month — or $12 less than the monthly price of the Plus plan — and offer 10 times higher rate limits for messages, file uploads and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-image-generation-is-now-faster-and-better-at-following-tweaks-180000750.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">image creation</a> than the free tier. The subscription also extends ChatGPT&#39;s memory and context window, meaning the chatbot will be better at remembering details from past conversations. That said, you&#39;ll see ads at this tier. To go ad-free, you&#39;ll need to subscribe to one of OpenAI&#39;s more expensive plans. For consumers, that means either the Plus or <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-wants-200-a-month-for-its-most-advanced-features-191054506.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Pro plans</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, OpenAI had been testing ads inside of ChatGPT since at least the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/leak-confirms-openai-is-preparing-ads-on-chatgpt-for-public-roll-out/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">end of last year</a>. As companies continue to pay a high cost for model training and inference, all chatbots are likely to feature ads in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/elon-musk-says-x-plans-to-introduce-ads-in-groks-responses/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">some form</a>. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html?src=rss]]></description>

There’s one where they undressed me and bent me over, and in the background is my child’s backpack that he’s wearing right now,” she said.</p><p>“I am also seeing images where they add bruises to women, beat them up, tie them up, mutilated,” St. Clair told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/05/elon-musk-ashley-st-clair-grok-fake-sexualised-images" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. “These sickos used to have to go to the dark depths of the internet, and now it is on a mainstream social media app.”</p><p>St. Clair said that, after she reported the images to X, the social platform replied that the content didn’t violate any policies. In addition, she claims that X left the images posted for up to seven days after she reported them. St. Clair said xAI then retaliated against her by creating more digitally undressed deepfakes of her, therefore “making [St. Clair] the laughingstock of the social media platform.”</p><p>She accused the company of then revoking her X Premium subscription, verification checkmark and ability to monetize content on the platform. “xAI further banned [her] from repurchasing Premium,” St. Clair’s court filing states.</p><p>On Wednesday, X said it changed its policies so that Grok would no longer generate sexualized images of children or nonconsensual nudity “in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal.” However, the standalone Grok app reportedly continues to undress and sexualize photos when prompted to do so.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-09/8424f5a0-4f40-11ee-acbb-bab134a1b1db" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-09/8424f5a0-4f40-11ee-acbb-bab134a1b1db" style="height:3402px;width:5103px;" alt="WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 23: Google CEO Sundar Pichai (L) and Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) listen as U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable with American and Indian business leaders in the East Room of the White House on June 23, 2023 in Washington, DC.

You are supposed to feed AI humanity and thoughts, and when you are doing things that particularly impact women, and they don’t want to participate in it because they are being targeted, it means the AI is inherently going to be biased.”</p><p>Speaking about Musk and his team, she added that “these people believe they are above the law, because they are.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Last week at CES, Lego <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">introduced its new Smart Play system</a>, with a tech-packed Smart Brick that can recognize and interact with sets and minifigures. It was unexpected and delightful to see Lego come up with a way to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-is-trying-to-make-tech-invisible-with-smart-play-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">modernize its bricks</a> without the need for apps, screens or AI.&nbsp;</p><p>So I was a little surprised this week when the Lego Education group <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=55b2488e-c460-4d49-99ec-60dfa20ede3f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=announced&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9hYm91dHVzL25ld3MvMjAyNi9qYW51YXJ5L2xlZ28tZWR1Y2F0aW9uLWNzLWFpIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NWIyNDg4ZS1jNDYwLTRkNDktOTllYy02MGRmYTIwZWRlM2YiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL2Fib3V0dXMvbmV3cy8yMDI2L2phbnVhcnkvbGVnby1lZHVjYXRpb24tY3MtYWkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYdEE5V4t61RjVVhKdLrAzFg9QCmcTCAZ8UncrC-OrdJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2026%2Fjanuary%2Flego-education-cs-ai" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/january/lego-education-cs-ai">announced</a> its latest initiative is the Computer Science and AI Learning Solution. After all, generative AI feels like the antithesis of Lego’s creative values. But Andrew Silwinski, Lego Education’s head of product experience, was quick to defend Lego’s approach, noting that being fluent in the tools behind AI is not about generating sloppy images or music and more about expanding what it means by teaching computer science.</p><p>“I think most people should probably know that we started working on this before ChatGPT [got big],” Silwinski told Engadget earlier this week. “Some of the ideas that underline AI are really powerful foundational ideas, regardless of the current frontier model that&#39;s out this week. Helping children understand probability and statistics, data quality, algorithmic bias, sensors, machine perception. These are really foundational core ideas that go back to the 1970s.”&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, Lego Education designed courses for grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8 that incorporate Lego bricks, additional hardware and lessons tailored to introducing the fundamentals of AI as an extension of existing computer science education. The kits are designed for four students to work together, with teacher oversight. Much of this all comes from learnings Lego found <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/resources/cs-ai-education-insights/#global-report" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">in a study it commissioned</a> showing that teachers often find they don’t have the right resources to teach these subjects. The study showed that half of teachers globally say “current resources leave students bored” while nearly half say “computer science isn’t relatable and doesn’t connect to students’ interests or day to day.” Given kids’ familiarity with Lego and the multiple decades of experience Lego Education has in putting courses like this together, it seems like a logical step to push in this direction.&nbsp;</p><p>In Lego’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/lego-education-computer-science-and-ai/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">materials about the new courses</a>, AI is far from the only subject covered. Coding, looping code, triggering events and sequences, if/then conditionals and more are all on display through the combination of Lego-built models and other hardware to motorize it. It feels more like a computer science course that also introduces concepts of AI rather than something with an end goal of having kids build a chatbot.</p><p>In fact, Lego set up a number of “red lines” in terms of how it would introduce AI. “No data can ever go across the internet to us or any other third party,” Silwinski said. “And that&#39;s a really hard bar if you know anything about AI.” So instead of going to the cloud, everything had to be able to do local inference on, as Silwinski said, “the 10-year-old Chromebooks you’ll see in classrooms.” He added that “kids can train their own machine learning models, and all of that is happening locally in the classroom, and none of that data ever leaves the student&#39;s device.”</p><p>Lego also says that its lessons never anthropomorphize AI, one of the things that is so common in consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and many more. “One of the things we&#39;re seeing a lot of with generative AI tools is children have a tendency to see them as somehow human or almost magical. A lot of it&#39;s because of the conversational interface, it abstracts all the mechanics away from the child.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lego also recognized that it had to build a course that’ll work regardless of a teacher’s fluency in such subjects. So a big part of developing the course was making sure that teachers had the tools they needed to be on top of whatever lessons they’re working on. “When we design and we test the products, we&#39;re not the ones testing in the classroom,” Silwinski said. “We give it to a teacher and we provide all of the lesson materials, all of the training, all of the notes, all the presentation materials, everything that they need to be able to teach the lesson.” Lego also took into account the fact that some schools might introduce its students to these things starting in Kindergarten, whereas others might skip to the grade 3-5 or 6-8 sets. To alleviate any bumps in the courses for students or teachers, Lego Education works with school districts and individual schools to make sure there’s an on-ramp for those starting from different places in their fluency.</p><p>While the idea of “teaching AI” seemed out of character for Lego initially, the approach it’s taking here actually reminds me a bit of Smart Play. With Smart Play, the technology is essentially invisible — kids can just open up a set, start building, and get all the benefits of the new system without having to hook up to an app or a screen. In the same vein, Silwinski said that a lot of the work you can do with the Computer Science and AI kit doesn’t need a screen, particularly the lessons designed for younger kids. And the sets themselves have a mode that acts similar to a mesh, where you connect numerous motors and sensors together to build “incredibly complex interactions and behaviors” without even needing a computer.</p><p>For educators interested in checking out this latest course, Lego has single kits up for pre-order starting at $339.95; they’ll start shipping in April. That’s the pricing for the K-2 sets, the 3-5 and 6-8 sets are $429.95 and $529.95, respectively. A single kit covers four students. Lego is also selling bundles with six kits, and school districts can also request a quote for bigger orders.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/legos-latest-educational-kit-seeks-to-teach-ai-as-part-of-computer-science-not-to-build-a-chatbot-184636741.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>While the latter lets you choose between building either a <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>OoT</em>-themed replica of the wise old guardian of the forest, the upcoming set is aimed squarely at fans of the series’ debut 3D outing. As you can probably guess from the name, it’s a brick-built tribute to Link and Princess Zelda’s climactic battle with Ganondorf in the seminal Nintendo 64 game, in what remains of the castle. Inside the rubble are three recovery hearts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>It’s hard to see how this works without a video, but Lego says you can release Link’s nemesis by pressing a button that raises him from the debris. As well as the minifigures for Zelda and Link — complete with his Master Sword and Hylian Shield — you also get a suitably transparent Navi to display. And then there’s the large poseable Ganon (the pig demon version of Ganondorf), which is probably the highlight of the whole set.</p>

You’ll just have to do the final Hyrule-saving &quot;Hyah!&quot; yourself, I guess.</p> 
<p>Lego The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle is available to pre-order from today and will be available from March 1, priced at $130.</p>

That&#39;s where things stand after a group of fired TikTok moderators in the UK filed a legal claim with an employment tribunal. <em>The Guardian</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/16/sacked-tiktok-workers-uk-legal-action-union" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reported</a> on Friday that around 400 TikTok content moderators who were unionizing were laid off before Christmas.</p><p>The workers were sacked a week before a vote was scheduled to establish a collective bargaining unit. The moderators said they wanted better protection against the personal toll of processing traumatic content at a high speed. They accused TikTok of unfair dismissal and violating UK trade union laws.</p><p>&quot;Content moderators have the most dangerous job on the internet,&quot; John Chadfield, the national officer for tech workers at the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said in a statement to <em>The Guardian</em>. &quot;They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use. Their job is to make sure this content doesn&#39;t reach TikTok&#39;s 30 million monthly users. It is high pressure and low paid. They wanted input into their workflows and more say over how they kept the platform safe. They said they were being asked to do too much with too few resources.&quot;</p><p>TikTok denied that the firings were union-busting, calling the accusations &quot;baseless.&quot; Instead, the company claimed the layoffs were part of a restructuring plan amid its adoption of AI for content moderation. The company said 91 percent of transgressive content is now removed automatically.</p><p>The company first <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cwu.org/press_release/tiktok-moderator-redundancies-union-busting-and-putting-millions-at-risk/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced a restructuring exercise</a> in August, just as hundreds of moderators in TikTok&#39;s London offices were organizing for union recognition. At the time, John Chadfield, CWU&#39;s National Officer for Tech, said the workers had long been &quot;sounding the alarm over the real-world costs of cutting human moderation teams in favour of hastily developed, immature AI alternatives.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That TikTok management have announced these cuts just as the company&#39;s workers are about to vote on having their union recognised stinks of union-busting and putting corporate greed over the safety of workers and the public,” Chadfield said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-sued-by-former-workers-over-alleged-union-busting-170446921.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Verizon is offering a very small <em>mea culpa</em> after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/verizon-says-its-service-is-back-after-a-10-hour-outage-183048229.html" data-i13n="slk:Wednesday&#39;s massive outage;cpos:1;pos:1">Wednesday&#39;s massive outage</a>, which drew more than 1.5 million reports on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/" data-i13n="slk:Downdetector;cpos:2;pos:1">Downdetector</a> and lasted hours. Initially, the carrier <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/verizonnews/status/2011820123154182420?s=61&amp;t=a-bloX1n-TZ50ofqhetO1A" data-i13n="slk:posted on X;cpos:3;pos:1">posted on X</a> that it will offer a $20 credit, but customers must redeem it in the myVerizon app. The company then said the credit could be claimed though customer service (via phone or chat), but our editors’ attempts to do so via chat were met with a message to wait for a text with further instructions. </p><p>Engadget editors began receiving the texts this morning (Jan 16) with a link to redeem. From there, you need to log into your account and visit the Account Overview section. Up top, there should be a Take Action or Mobile Actions button with a red notification circle. Click that and you’ll see a pop-up about the credit and a Redeem Now button. After you click that, you’re done, and Verizon says you should see the credit in one or two billing cycles. Of course, you’ll want to keep an eye out that it actually happens and contact the company if it doesn’t show up. </p><p>&quot;This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit really can,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us.&quot; Incensed customers have largely replied with incredulity, both at the miniscule amount, and that it isn&#39;t being applied automatically. The entire redemption process takes a few clicks and about a minute to complete, which makes it even more frustrating that it can’t be automatically applied to every customer’s bill. </p><p><strong>Update, January 15 2026, 11:57 PM ET:</strong> Verizon says the credit can be claimed through customer service via phone, chat and online in addition to the myVerizon app.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update, January 16 2026, 10:29 AM ET:</strong> This story has been updated with detailed info about the redemption process which Verizon now says is completed with a link that will be texted to customers. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-claim-verizons-20-credit-for-wednesdays-service-outage-171909695.html?src=rss]]></description>

If the Netflix deal does go through, the company’s co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos, has attempted to ease concerns around what that could mean for theaters.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=edff5e5c-58a3-46cc-ae59-ade329f56281&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=The+New+York+Times%2C&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAxLzE2L2J1c2luZXNzL21lZGlhL3RlZC1zYXJhbmRvcy1uZXRmbGl4Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkZmY1ZTVjLTU4YTMtNDZjYy1hZTU5LWFkZTMyOWY1NjI4MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyNi8wMS8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS90ZWQtc2FyYW5kb3MtbmV0ZmxpeC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeh75TwJihcd4wrBucs6kH49a4c5e4VrKjTXI89QUGos&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F01%2F16%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fted-sarandos-netflix.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/business/media/ted-sarandos-netflix.html"><em>The New York Times</em>,</a> Sarandos responded to a question about his company’s commitment to the theatrical business by insisting that he has no interest in bringing a swift end to it. &quot;We will run that business largely like it is today, with 45-day windows,&quot; he said.  &quot;I’m giving you a hard number. If we’re going to be in the theatrical business, and we are, we’re competitive people — we want to win. I want to win opening weekend. I want to win box office.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Prior to this new <em>NYT </em>interview’s publication, <em>Deadline </em><a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/box-office-stranger-things-finale-1236660176/">reported</a> that it had been told by sources that Netflix was supportive of a 17-day window, which would obviously be far more damaging to theaters. This came after the <em>Stranger Things </em>finale reportedly banked north of $25m during its brief theatrical run over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>Sarandos was also asked if he regretted <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">saying</a> the theatrical business as we know it today is an &quot;outmoded&quot; idea. He told the <em>NYT</em>: &quot;You have to listen to that quote again. I said &#39;outmoded for some.&#39; I mean, like the town that &#39;Sinners&#39; is supposed to be set in does not have a movie theater there. For those folks, it’s certainly outmoded. You’re not going to get in the car and go to the next town to go see a movie.&quot; (Movies are actually nascent technology in <em>Sinners</em>, which is set in the 1930s. Bad example, Ted!) He went on to explain that for someone like his daughter, who lives in Manhattan and has a number of theaters within walking distance of her home, the term does not apply in the same way.</p>
<p>The Netflix co-chief exec’s latest comments seem to be designed to appease theater owners as much as the movie-going public, after a number of chains <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/movie-theaters-netflix-warner-bros-1236466424/">opposed</a> the proposed WBD sale. &quot;Such an acquisition will further consolidate control over production and distribution of motion pictures in the hands of a single, dominant, global streaming platform in a market that is already highly concentrated,&quot; said trade organization Cinema United in a statement to Congress.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-will-give-wbd-movies-45-day-theater-exclusivity-if-deal-goes-through-141223786.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039"><ins>opened two investigations</ins></a> into Microsoft-owned game studio Activision Blizzard, centered around the mobile games <em>Diablo Immortal</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>. The AGCM alleges the free-to-play games use &quot;misleading and aggressive practices&quot; to encourage in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Regulators say the games rely on a &quot;deceptive user interface design&quot; meant to encourage longer and more frequent play sessions while bombarding players with reminders and opportunities to spend real money in-game. Players might be reminded to buy a limited-time item before it&#39;s gone or urged not to miss out on rewards, with in-app messages and push notifications that reach players during and outside gameplay. The authority also raised concerns about virtual currency and in-game currency bundles that can make it harder to understand real-world costs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Parental control settings are also being scrutinized as the AGCM says the default settings are too permissive, such as allowing in-game purchases and unlimited play time. The watchdog will also investigate potential violations of consumer contractual rights and practices that may encourage players to unknowingly give up those rights, such as the EU&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.europe-consommateurs.eu/en/shopping-internet/14-days-to-withdraw.html"><ins>14-day right of withdrawal</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Free-to-play games have long leaned on loot boxes and other in-game purchases to drive monetization. Unlike full-priced games like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-reveals-diablo-iv-monetization-170021763.html"><em><ins>Diablo IV</ins></em></a>, these systems can blur the line between natural progression and pay-to-win. For an idea of how quickly costs can add up, consider one player who reportedly <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-immortal-player-spends-100k-on-game-now-cant-find-anyone-suitable-to-matchmake-with"><ins>spent $100,000</ins></a> on <em>Diablo Immortal</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/italian-regulators-are-investigating-activision-blizzards-monetization-practices-135057481.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco-founded Smart glasses maker Viture has been sued in a US court by rival XREAL over claims it infringed on its patents, XREAL announced in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xreal-files-us-patent-infringement-lawsuit-against-viture-to-defend-foundational-augmented-reality-technology-302662707.html">press release</a>. The complaint, lodged in a federal Texas court, accuses Viture of illegally incorporating XREAL&#39;s patented tech into its products including the Luma Pro, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e519e04-ca2b-46bc-8145-ca18295fa581&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Luma+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52aXR1cmUuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3Qvdml0dXJlLWx1bWEtdWx0cmEteHItZ2xhc3Nlcz9jb2xvcj1KZXQrQmxhY2smc2l6ZT1SZWd1bGFyKyUyOElQRCs1OC03MG1tJTI5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZTUxOWUwNC1jYTJiLTQ2YmMtODE0NS1jYTE4Mjk1ZmE1ODEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpdHVyZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC92aXR1cmUtbHVtYS11bHRyYS14ci1nbGFzc2VzP2NvbG9yPUpldCtCbGFjayZzaXplPVJlZ3VsYXIrJTI4SVBEKzU4LTcwbW0lMjkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcKC1VJzG4tMr2c7w7OeNOOwp7PlQ2uR0mH9kap76Wof&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viture.com%2Fproduct%2Fviture-luma-ultra-xr-glasses%3Fcolor%3DJet%2BBlack%26size%3DRegular%2B%2528IPD%2B58-70mm%2529" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.viture.com/product/viture-luma-ultra-xr-glasses?color=Jet+Black&amp;size=Regular+%28IPD+58-70mm%29">Luma Ultra</a> and Beast models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The lawsuit is not merely about enforcing a single patent,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;It is about stopping a pattern of intellectual property infringement that undermines the integrity of innovation and endangers continued technological development in this industry.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>XREAL has already won a preliminary injunction against Viture in Germany. That resulted in a sales freeze in that country, which could spread to nine other European nations including France, Italy and Spain. That injunction affects Viture&#39;s Pro, Luma and Luma Pro smart glasses.</p>
<p>Both companies make augmented reality (AR) glasses with built-in displays that connect to smartphone or laptops, letting you play games, watch movies or do productivity tasks. Their products offer similar display resolutions and fields of view, both of which are key specifications for those products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, Viture issued its own statement: &quot;Our product does not infringe upon the cited patent in any way,&quot; the company told Tom&#39;s Guide. &quot;We encourage everyone to look closely at the patent itself and form their own judgment, it becomes clear very quickly how weak and questionable it is. XREAL has simultaneously circulated false claims suggesting that Viture is &#39;banned across nine European countries.&#39; This is entirely untrue.&quot; The company added that it&#39;s taking legal action itself because of XREAL&#39;s comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viture is a relatively new player in the AR/VR world, but XREAL&#39;s lawsuit could be a prelude to similar actions, judging by the wording in its press release. XREAL holds over 800 patent and patent applications around the world around AR, VR and other tech, and claims that Viture has fewer than 70 and none in the US and Europe. At CES 2026, XREAL unveiled <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/xreal-updates-its-entry-level-personal-cinema-glasses-at-ces-140000544.html">several new products</a>, including the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html">ROG X R1 AR glasses</a> built in conjunction with ASUS.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/xreal-files-lawsuit-against-rival-smart-glass-maker-viture-133018692.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-has-stopped-producing-the-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb-saying-theyve-reached-end-of-life-162012253.html">telling</a> the YouTube channel <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em></a> that it was putting its RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and 5070 Ti into &quot;end-of-life status,&quot; ASUS has backtracked on those comments and now says the GPUs will remain on sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Certain media may have received incomplete information from an ASUS PR representative regarding these products,&quot; the company said in a dedicated <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://press.asus.com/news/statements/asus-rtx-5070ti-5060ti-statement/">press release</a>.&quot; The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL). ASUS has no plans to stop selling these models.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ASUS further clarified that supply fluctuations, primarily due to memory supply constraints, have temporarily affected production output and stocks. &quot;As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement. ASUS will continue to support the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB and is working closely with partners to stabilize supply as conditions improve.&quot;</p>
<p>Yesterday, <em>Hardware Unboxed</em> said that ASUS &quot;explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.&quot; In a new pinned comment, the channel noted that the new information &quot;completely walks back their original statement to us.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Hardware Unboxed</em> learned of the shortage by speaking to resellers in Australia, who said that the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year. Based on that, along with ASUS&#39;s statement, they released the video in question yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although ASUS now says that it will still make both of those GPUs, being able to buy one could be next to impossible, based on what retailers told <em>Hardware Unboxed</em>. The AI boom has sent the cost of memory soaring, leading to price hikes for GPUs and other PC components. That in turn has led to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1povjfp/nvidia_to_cut_gaming_gpu_production_by_3040/">anger</a> among gamers, and the problem <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/gamers-face-another-crushing-blow-as-nvidia-allegedly-slashes-gpu-supply-by-20-percent-leaker-claims-no-new-geforce-gaming-gpu-until-2027">may get much worse</a> before it gets better.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/asus-changes-mind-will-continue-selling-the-rtx-5070-ti-after-all-130934271.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/ireland-is-investigating-tiktok-and-linkedin-for-possible-dsa-violations-194519622.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">TikTok</a> is bolstering its age-verification measures across Europe. In the coming weeks, the platform will roll out upgraded age-detection tech in the European Economic Area, as well as in the UK and Switzerland. </p><p>The systems will assess the likely age of a user based on their profile information and activity. When the tech flags an account that may belong to a user aged under 13 (the minimum age to use TikTok), a specialist moderator will assess whether it should be banned. TikTok will send users in Europe a notification to tell them about these measures and offer them a chance to learn more.</p><p>Also, if a moderator is looking at content for other reasons and thinks an account might belong to an underage user, they can flag it to a specialist for further review. Anyone can report an account they suspect is used by someone under 13 as well. TikTok says it removes about 6 million underage accounts in total from the platform every month.</p><p>Those whose accounts are banned can appeal if they think their access was wrongly terminated. Users can then provide a government-approved ID, a credit card authorization or selfie for age estimation (the latter process has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/robloxs-age-verification-system-is-reportedly-a-trainwreck-220320016.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">not gone well for <em>Roblox </em>as of late</a>, as kids found workarounds for age checks). </p><p>TikTok acknowledged that there&#39;s no single ideal solution to the issue as things stand. &quot;Despite best efforts, there remains no globally agreed-upon method for effectively confirming a person&#39;s age in a way that also preserves their privacy,&quot; it stated in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/updates-to-how-we-enforce-age-appropriate-experiences-in-europe?lang=en-150" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a blog post</a>. &quot;At TikTok, we&#39;re committed to keeping children under the age of 13 off our platform, providing teens with age-appropriate experiences and continuing to assess and implement a range of solutions. We believe that a multi-layered approach to age assurance — one in which multiple techniques are used — is essential to protecting teens and upholding safety-by-design principles.&quot;</p><p>TikTok is rolling out these practices after a pilot in Europe over the last year. That project helped the platform to identify and remove thousands more underage accounts. It worked with the Data Protection Commission (its main privacy regulator in the EU) to help ensure it complied with the bloc’s strict data protection standards.</p><p>These measures are coming into force amid intensifying calls to keep kids off social media. A social media ban for under 16s in Australia went into effect last month. Affected platforms have collectively closed or restricted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/jan/15/australia-u16-social-media-ban-millions-accounts-blocked" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">millions of accounts</a> as a result. Reddit has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-sues-australia-over-underage-social-media-ban-143018208.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">filed a lawsuit over the ban</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar ban <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k9z535e08o" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">might be on the cards in the UK</a> amid public pressure and cross-party support. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said &quot;all options are on the table&quot; and that he was watching &quot;what is happening in Australia.&quot;</p><p>The House of Lords is set to vote on proposals for an under-16 social media ban next week. If an amendment passes, members of parliament will hold a binding vote on the matter in the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-tightens-age-verification-across-europe-130000847.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you thought we were <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html"><ins>exaggerating</ins></a>, the hunger for memory and GPUs is making many companies reassess their priorities. YouTube channel Hardware Unboxed discovered ASUS has stopped producing the RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB due to the ongoing memory crunch. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to manufacture in the current climate.</p>
<p>“Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” an NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget.</p>
<p>At CES 2026, we saw PCs and computing in the next 12 months will have higher prices and more limited availability for consumers. At the end of 2025, RAM prices skyrocketed, driven by demand from AI data centers. That’s not stopping anytime soon.</p>

<p>Matthew McConaughey filed trademark applications to prevent AI companies from using his likeness without permission, and the US Patent and Trademark Office has approved eight so far.</p>
<p>Trademarks were for video and audio clips featuring the actor staring, smiling and talking. One was for an audio recording of him saying “alright, alright, alright,” his catchphrase from the movie<em> Dazed and Confused. </em>Under the law, it’s already prohibited for companies to steal someone’s likeness to sell products. However, given the vague rules governing the use of someone’s likeness, McConaughey is taking a proactive approach. McConaughey himself is an investor in ElevenLabs and has partnered with the AI startup to create a Spanish version of his newsletter. Está bien, está bien, está bien.</p>

<p>The second season of Amazon’s excellent Fallout show is currently streaming, but the company is already looking to generate more revenue from its license to the well-regarded game series. Prime Video has greenlit an unscripted reality show titled <em>Fallout Shelter</em>. It will be a 10-episode run with Studio Lambert, the team behind reality projects including <em>Squid Game: The Challenge </em>and<em> The Traitors.</em></p>

<p>Following numerous complaints and several state and national investigations, X is revising its policies on Grok’s image-editing capabilities. New safeguards will place Grok’s image-generating features behind X’s subscription offering, and it will geoblock all users’ ability to generate images of real people in… well, less clothing, in regions where it’s illegal.</p>
<p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta cited one analysis that found “more than half of the 20,000 images generated by xAI between Christmas and New Year depicted people in minimal clothing.” That’s been the primary use?</p>
