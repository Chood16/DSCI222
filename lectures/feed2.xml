                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PC and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/the-gaming-monitors-that-caught-our-eye-at-ces-2026-130000433.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">gaming monitors</a> are among the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">CES 2026</a> announcements, and Dell may just have one of the most impressive. The company launched an ultrawide, curved 52-inch 6K monitor at the show this year, a productivity behemoth designed for stock traders, engineers and other professionals. Dell claims the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the first 52-incher to market that’s also ultrawide, curved and supports 6K resolution (but with that many qualifiers almost anything can be a world first).</p><p>Given Dell’s experience in the monitor realm, this could be a dream display for professionals who handle vast data sets such as trading platforms, AutoCAD, 3D rendering software, spreadsheets and more. It sports a 120Hz refresh rate on an IPS Black panel and emits up to 60 percent less blue light when compared to competing monitors. It delivers an impressive 129 ppi (for comparison a 4K 32-inch monitor delivers 138 ppi) and an ambient light sensor helps avoid eye strain during long work sessions.</p><p>Users can connect up to four PCs to the monitor simultaneously, which can use picture-by-picture to treat each partitioned screen as an individual monitor. It also features built-in KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) features that let users control all connected PCs via a single mouse and keyboard. The monitor can also charge your laptop with up to 140W of power via a Thunderbolt 4 connection.</p><p>Dell also rolled out a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with support for both True Black 500 HDR and Dolby Vision. It claims true-to-life color accuracy out of the box and excellent gamut coverage at 99 percent of DCI-P3. This monitor would be a strong fit for film and photo editing.</p><p>The Dell UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is priced at $2,900 with stand or $2,800 without. It will be widely available starting January 6. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor comes in at $2,600 and will be available beginning February 24.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-unveils-a-massive-52-inch-6k-ultrawide-curved-monitor-at-ces-2026-140024842.html?src=rss]]></description>

That&#39;s because <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they&#39;re planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we&#39;re keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weird tech</a>.</p><p>You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either.

We&#39;ll be keeping this story updated throughout the week.&nbsp;We also have <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">CES live updates</a>, with all the latest news from the event.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lego">Lego</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SMARTBrick_16x9.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SMARTBrick_16x9.jpg" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026." data-uuid="993612a1-35f9-42d9-8d48-d00721bd813c"><figcaption>Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lego</div></figure><p>In its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/follow-the-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-right-here-130005940.html" data-i13n="slk:first CES appearance;cpos:5;pos:1">first CES appearance</a>, Lego announced the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html" data-i13n="slk:Smart Brick;cpos:6;pos:1">Smart Brick</a>, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. </p><p>The first “<a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;slk:Smart Play;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and <em>The Imperial March</em>.</p><p>Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000436.html" data-i13n="slk:check out Lego&#x002019;s Smart Play system in person;cpos:8;pos:1">check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person</a> and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.</p><p>All of this seems extremely cool.

Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. </p><p>It’s interesting stuff.

The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer hut no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). </p><p>At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model and the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.</p><p>There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victorla and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-just-announced-a-bunch-of-new-earbuds-at-ces-130044239.html" data-i13n="slk:earbuds;cpos:103;pos:1">earbuds</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-launches-a-trio-of-gaming-headsets-for-ces-130000929.html" data-i13n="slk:gaming headsets;cpos:104;pos:1">gaming headsets</a>.

There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.</p><p>Anker, meanwhile, has new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ankers-new-aerofit-2-earbuds-can-switch-between-open-ear-and-anc-form-factors-160014977.html" data-i13n="cpos:107;pos:1">AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds</a> that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear earbuds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. </p><p>Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ces-2026-shokz-new-earbuds-effectively-reduce-noise-while-keeping-your-ears-open-080000996.html" data-i13n="cpos:108;pos:1">Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds</a>, which have Dolby Atmos support. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the exterior of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now, but the audio quality is “excellent,” Billy wrote in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/klipsch-atlas-hp-1-hands-on-a-return-to-hi-fi-headphones-at-ces-2026-130000415.html" data-i13n="cpos:109;pos:1">his hands-on story</a>. </p><h2 id="jump-link-smart-home">Smart home</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/bcb64fa0-ebc3-11f0-bfb5-76c00759b395" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/bcb64fa0-ebc3-11f0-bfb5-76c00759b395" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum" data-uuid="3a05afd9-e0ce-3a78-85f1-f0ebad21e97c"><figcaption>Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>As ever, there was a ton of smart home gear at CES this year. One thing that caught our eye is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/dreames-latest-robot-vacuum-concept-has-slightly-terrifying-legs-that-can-climb-full-size-stairs-210000399.html" data-i13n="cpos:110;pos:1">robot vacuum concept from Dreame</a>. It&#39;s one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. </p><p>While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXSqguJ3J0c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html" data-i13n="cpos:111;pos:1">Narwhal</a> built a vacuum for your mattress. The U50 is a handheld model that has a UV sterilization light. It has a high-speed tapping feature that can help dislodge gunk and mites. The company also showed off a new robot vacuum and mop with a &quot;PetCare Mode&quot; you can use to track down your bestest furry friend and keep an eye on them when you&#39;re not home. You can even talk to your pet via a speaker system. Both products should be available in the spring.</p><p>Anker&#39;s Eufy brand has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ankers-ces-smart-home-lineup-includes-a-1600-eufy-robovac-160000133.html" data-i13n="cpos:112;pos:1">a new robot vacuum too</a>, along with a video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock.

At a time when so many companies are desperate to sell you a subscription for dependable monthly revenue, that’s quite refreshing. Devices that are part of Ugreen’s platform — including a video doorbell and 4K cameras — should be available later this year.</p><p>IKEA made its CES debut to show off some of its smart home tech, namely a string of budget-friendly, Matter-compatible devices. Along with some home sensors, the company plans to offer a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug and a $6 smart remote in the coming weeks. Senior reporter Amy Skorheim <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikeas-first-ces-appearance-included-a-6-matter-smart-bulb-172623474.html" data-i13n="cpos:116;pos:1">checked out the products</a> and particularly liked the BILREA remote, which you can use to control IKEA&#39;s lamps and other devices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f327a7d0-ebac-11f0-9bfd-2f45a278fd90" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f327a7d0-ebac-11f0-9bfd-2f45a278fd90" style="height:843px;width:1500px;" alt="Philips Hue SpatialAware feature" data-uuid="d1426c4a-1a5f-319b-93bb-7357d1bc0b09"><figcaption>Philips Hue SpatialAware feature</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Speaking of smart bulbs, Philips announced some Hue updates at CES.

Philips will be rolling out SpatialAware to Hue users this spring.

There&#39;s also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge&#39;s crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/noshlee.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/noshlee.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1800px;" alt="Nosh" data-uuid="4ad4395e-497b-4de1-af3b-8fcf8812814d"><figcaption>Nosh</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/nosh-is-an-ai-cooking-robot-for-the-meal-prep-crowd-170000610.html" data-i13n="cpos:120;pos:1">Nosh</a>, meanwhile, is an AI cooking robot that you&#39;ll be able to buy in the next few months.

Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you&#39;re ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.</p><p>Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/ces-2026-the-tone-outdoors-t1-solved-the-biggest-problem-with-leaf-blowers-234309500.html" data-i13n="cpos:121;pos:1">T1 leaf blower</a> (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September.

New PC monitors are among the CES announcements, with several companies are using the trade show as an opportunity to update their gaming monitor lineups. Some companies are showing off expanded OLED panels with improved refresh rates, brightness and color production, while others are showing off <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">weirder</a> ideas like a glasses-free 3D monitor. The collection below are some of our favorite gaming monitors that have already been announced:&nbsp;</p><h2 id="jump-link-lg-ultragear-gx7">LG UltraGear GX7</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/cc274f90-eaf9-11f0-926d-18b410a2ddcf" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/cc274f90-eaf9-11f0-926d-18b410a2ddcf" style="height:1813px;width:3000px;" alt="LG&#39;s new UltraGear OLED monitor on a white background." data-uuid="37d0fa85-37a5-3b30-9bac-509f84d53a96"><figcaption>LG&#39;s latest QHD OLED gaming monitor is its brightest to date</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lgs-ultragear-gx7-is-its-fastest-and-brightest-oled-gaming-monitor-to-date-160059443.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">LG UltraGear GX7</a> is the fastest and brightest gaming monitor LG has offered so far and a gaming-focused showcase for LG Display&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.lgdisplay.com/eng/product/tv-display/oled-4th-gen" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">4th-gen RGB Tandem 2.0 OLED technology</a>. The new display tech splits up the yellow layer of the company&#39;s 3rd-gen OLED tech into distinct red and green layers that, when stacked with blue layers, create brighter, more energy-efficient screens.</p><p>In the case of the UltraGear GX7, the new 27-inch monitor reaches a typical brightness of 335 nits, and is VES DisplayHDR True Black 500 certified, for deeper contrast between the dark and bright parts of the screen. LG touts the display&#39;s Dual Mode, which lets discerning gamers switch between two distinct settings: a 540Hz refresh rate mode at QHD resolution, when image quality is what you care about most, or a 720Hz refresh rate mode at HD resolution, when speed is your priority.</p><p>Whichever mode you choose, LG promises the monitor will offer a smooth and stutter free experience. It has a 0.02ms response time and supports both NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSYNC Premium Pro, so you should be set, regardless of what your computer&#39;s specialty is. For $1,000, the LG UltraGear GX7 seems like a high watermark for OLED gaming monitors.</p><h2 id="jump-link-samsung-odyssey-3d-and-odyssey-oled-g8">Samsung Odyssey 3D and Odyssey OLED G8</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f771f3d0-e0b8-11f0-afb3-88dc93dd247b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f771f3d0-e0b8-11f0-afb3-88dc93dd247b" style="height:699px;width:1000px;" alt="A motorcycle bursting out a of a Samsung Odyssey 3D monitor." data-uuid="6c1fbb53-4d7f-3952-8549-a5b7e71585c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Samsung&#39;s new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Odyssey 3D</a> monitor is the &quot;world&#39;s first 6K display with glasses-free 3D,&quot; with a 6,144 x 3,456 resolution, and the ability to take games &quot;beyond 2D&quot; by tracking the position of your eyes, and enhancing terrain, distance and object separation. Even if you&#39;re not interested in playing formerly 2D games like <em>Lies of P: Overture</em> with an added sense of depth, a 32-inch LCD screen with a 165Hz refresh rate that&#39;s capable of being boosted to 330Hz through Samsung&#39;s Dual Mode is nothing to sneeze at, especially with a 1ms response time.</p><p>On top of its big 3D monitor, Samsung is also pushing its own updated OLED tech at CES. The company&#39;s new 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 uses a 4K QD-OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and a glare-free treatment for added visibility. The monitor has a VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 certification, but unlike LG&#39;s display, its brightness is capped at 300 nits.</p><h2 id="jump-link-asus-rog-swift-oled-pg27ucwm-and-rog-strix-pulsar-xg27aqngv">ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM and ROG Strix Pulsar XG27AQNGV</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ASUS-ROG-Swift-OLED.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ASUS-ROG-Swift-OLED.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="The back and front of ASUS&#39; new ROG Swift monitor with a Tandem OLED panel." data-uuid="777bcb1c-d890-458e-8d21-e25c0268f8a7"><figcaption>The back and front of ASUS&#39; new ROG Swift monitor with a Tandem OLED panel.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>While the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=956bf7a1-2d74-4ed3-9241-ef90d36cecbf&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=ASUS+ROG+Swift+OLED+PG27UCWM&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbDfdldTMhRnxTUIQkuOAW3dJybSCwaXGfAcxs4r6_Yq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Frog.asus.com%2Fus%2Farticles%2Fgaming-monitors%2Frgb-stripe-pixel-oled-tech-debuts-in-the-rog-swift-pg34wcdn-xg34wcdms-pg27ucwm%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://rog.asus.com/us/articles/gaming-monitors/rgb-stripe-pixel-oled-tech-debuts-in-the-rog-swift-pg34wcdn-xg34wcdms-pg27ucwm/">ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM</a> uses a Tandem OLED panel – a panel with two light-emitting layers, like the Ultra XDR Retina display on Apple&#39;s recent iPad Pros – the big change ASUS is focused on at CES 2026 is its new RGB Stripe OLED layout, technology <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.lgcorp.com/media/release/29720" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">LG helped pioneer</a>.

Like Asus, MSI is mixing different OLED display technologies for better results. This new monitor uses a 5th-gen Tandem QD-OLED panel with an &quot;RGB Stripe sub-pixel layout&quot; for sharper visuals. MSI also applies what it calls &quot;DarkArmor Film&quot; to &quot;enhance light absorption,&quot; eliminate the reddish tint some QD-OLED panels have under ambient light, and boost black levels by &quot;up to 40 percent.&quot;</p><p>As an ultrawide, the MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36 has a resolution of 3,440 x 1,440, an aspect ratio of 21:9 and a refresh rate of 360Hz. MSI says the monitor can reach a peak brightness of 1,300 nits, and the company provides multiple HDR modes to switch between depending on your needs. Similar to ASUS, the monitor also includes a sensor for detecting whether a human is in front of the screen – MSI calls it an AI Care Sensor – so that the monitor can power-off or enter standby mode when not in active use.</p><h2 id="jump-link-viewsonic-vx2738-2k-oled-gaming-monitor">ViewSonic VX2738 2K OLED Gaming Monitor</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VX2738-2K-OLED.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VX2738-2K-OLED.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="ViewSonic&#39;s new 24-inch OLED monitor." data-uuid="e41bc635-7515-4bfa-b480-bd8e66e17e91"><figcaption>ViewSonic&#39;s new 24-inch OLED monitor.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ViewSonic</div></figure><p>ViewSonic&#39;s new gaming monitors are more approachable and (presumably) more affordable than the options from competitors, but not necessarily less performant.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?s=20">unveiled</a> the first color variants for the Switch 2 Joy-Cons in light purple and light green, set to arrive on February 12 alongside <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-tennis-fever-hits-the-court-on-february-12-134227490.html"><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a>. The new controllers are now on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-l-r-light-purple-light-green-127067/">pre-order for $100</a> and include matching wrist-straps.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="89e8446f139a4dfba80cffa7aa2a0474" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-l-r-light-purple-light-green-127067/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Other than the colorway, these are standard Joy-Con 2 controllers with motion controls and HD rumble, along with the C Button for GameChat and the mouse controls for compatible games. However, you may have noticed something weird about them — the colors are on the inner rails, so you&#39;ll barely be able to see them when the Joy-Con 2s are connected to a Switch 2 console, except around the thumbsticks. By contrast, previous <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-kicks-off-the-summer-with-pastel-hued-joy-con-controllers-141002133.html">Joy-Con </a><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-kicks-off-the-summer-with-pastel-hued-joy-con-controllers-141002133.html">color variants</a> covered the entire shell. The new Switch 2 Joy-Con colors also clash with the light blue and orange strips on the inner left and right of the console.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Along with the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, Nintendo released a lengthy game-play video for Mario Tennis Fever, also set to arrive on February 12th. It details some of the key gameplay features, like &quot;fever shots,&quot; the ice racket and moves like slides and dives.&nbsp;</p>

The statement is even more true if you have a Pixel phone. If you&#39;re on the market for a new pair, you can grab the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $165 in the hazel colorway, which is $54 off their usual price. Other color options are also discounted, just not as steeply.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The device made our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a>, and this is particularly true for those tied into the Pixel ecosystem. These earbuds are on the smaller side and, more importantly, comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They also manage to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/pixel-buds-pro-2-review-tiny-earbuds-with-big-sound-and-a-direct-line-to-gemini-170016328.html">deliver pristine audio</a>, as we were fans of the punchy bass, full mids and crisp highs on offer.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The battery lasts for 30 hours when you include return trips to the charging case, at around eight hours a pop. They offer multipoint Bluetooth that switches between audio sources with just a single button press. There&#39;s an app for keeping an eye on battery levels and ANC levels.</p> 
<p>The primary downside when these were first released was the high price tag, which has been alleviated by this sale. Beyond that, there&#39;s really just one nitpick. Smaller earbuds translate to a smaller touch panel, which requires precision to operate.</p>

This is marked down from $250, a hefty 20 percent discount. This model was just released in September of last year, so consider this a substantial discount for such a recent product.</p>

 <core-commerce id="9d2a9c264099463ba10d3ed1a8a4d49b" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We gave these AirPods a score of 90 out of 100 in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html"><ins>review</ins></a> and we consider them the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html"><ins>best wireless earbuds for iPhone</ins></a> users. The third generation model is a substantial update to an already impressive product, bringing new features like live translation to the table.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The AirPods Pro 3 also offer heart-rate tracking, allowing them to stream live data to Apple Fitness and other third-party workout apps. This lets you track your fitness and close activity rings similarly to when using an Apple Watch.</p> 
<p>Apple also improved the sound quality of this generation thanks in large part to a redesigned acoustic architecture that improves how air is delivered into the ear canal. Additionally, the company changed the angle of the drivers to help more sound get where it needs to go instead of bouncing off the sides of your ear. We felt the jump in audio quality from the last generation to this one was substantial.</p> 
<p>The ANC on the AirPods Pro 3 has also been improved. Apple claims this model filters out twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. We found the noise cancellation to be top-notch.</p> 
<p>Live Translation is as neat as it sounds, leveraging the AirPods&#39; noise cancellation tech, Apple&#39;s AI and beamforming mics to help you understand a speaker in a different language. Right now, this is limited to a handful of languages with more being added over time.</p> 
<p>It&#39;s not often you see one of Apple&#39;s best and most recent products on sale for 20 percent off, so if you&#39;re in the market for an upgrade or your first set of AirPods, consider taking advantage of this deal.</p>

The Smart Brick, combined with Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, responds dynamically to movement, proximity and context, triggering sounds and interactions without screens or apps. Seeing kids physically act out Star Wars battles while the bricks reacted in real time made it clear this is designed first and foremost for active social play, not digital distraction.</p><h2 id="jump-link-wheelmove">WheelMove</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WheelMove.JPG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WheelMove.JPG" style="height:3648px;width:5472px;" alt="A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground" data-uuid="6de563c8-09a1-48d9-b84b-34979a029fd9"/><figcaption>A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">WheelMove’s motorized wheelchair attachment</a> is compact, surprisingly quick to install and genuinely empowering in action. The add-on lifts a chair’s front wheels and adds powered assistance, making grass, cobblestones and slopes far easier to navigate.

Using computer vision to analyze bowel movements and urination, the device aims to establish a personal baseline and flag changes over time, with gut health and GLP-1 users firmly in mind. It’s too early to judge accuracy, but seeing it in person made it feel less gimmicky and more like a niche wellness tool worth testing.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ikea-smart-home-gear">IKEA smart home gear</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_donut_lamp.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_donut_lamp.jpg" style="height:1807px;width:3213px;" alt="The popular VARMBLIXT donut lamp is now smart.

You can pick one up for only $16, and it&#39;s available in two- and four-packs as well at a discount.</p> 
<p>The TimeCapsule case uses two AA batteries to offer up to 14 times the lifespan of the CR2032 battery that powers an AirTag. The company based those estimates on Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, so your mileage may vary. Once an AirTag is seated inside the case, which is a compact 4.45 x 1.57 inches, it is sealed shut with four screws at the corners. The case is fiber-reinforced, according to Elevation Lab, and rated IP69 waterproof.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

It’s also where companies feel emboldened to ask some very strange questions, like whether your toilet should analyze your poop or your nails should change color on command. From experimental laptops to health tech that probably didn’t need a camera, these are the weirdest gadgets we spotted at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>.</p><h2 id="jump-link-throne-toilet-computer">Throne toilet computer</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet." data-uuid="1b6635a2-cf8b-41f8-9247-68a48520eee5"><figcaption>The Throne device perched on the side of a toilet.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Throne</a> is a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.thronescience.com/products/throne-one" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">toilet-mounted computer</a> that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.</p><h2 id="jump-link-vivoo-hygienic-flowpad-smart-menstrual-pad">Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png" style="height:698px;width:1280px;" alt="Image of Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad" data-uuid="a782ed2d-1d1b-4b9b-8be4-934943b97f7f"><figcaption>Vivoo&#39;s FlowPad</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivoo</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/vivoos-toilet-computer-keeps-an-eye-on-your-hydration-030000209.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Vivoo</a> looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized.

It’s a bold reminder that CES 2026 is fully committed to quantifying everything — even the stuff we’d rather not discuss over brunch.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable">Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Legion-Pro-rollable-lead.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Legion-Pro-rollable-lead.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="While it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept&#39;s screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across." data-uuid="83660727-0d44-4e79-96c8-0422b504fc34"><figcaption>While it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept&#39;s screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable</a> is what happens when a gaming laptop decides it wants to be a widescreen monitor mid-match. Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.</p><h2 id="jump-link-lenovo-thinkbook-xd-rollable">Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid." data-uuid="5ca5fe56-6894-4cd9-8f38-2fd1b5e0de40"><figcaption>With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">ThinkBook XD Rollable</a> is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ohdoki-handy-2-pro">OhDoki Handy 2 Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg" style="height:1012px;width:1800px;" alt="Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro" data-uuid="9f025e81-246a-4ff1-810a-6824e6d7216a"><figcaption>Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-handy-2-pro-is-an-overclockable-sex-toy-044456140.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro</a> arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.</p><h2 id="jump-link-ipolish">iPolish</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">iPolish</a> finally made <em>Total Recall</em> nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.</p><h2 id="jump-link-hisense-s6-followme-display">Hisense S6 FollowMe display</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/991681_12ce05cf7175457fab831066cb9b5d1b~mv2_copy.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/991681_12ce05cf7175457fab831066cb9b5d1b~mv2_copy.jpg" style="height:1299px;width:2309px;" alt="Hisense S6 FollowMe display" data-uuid="084ec8c7-0370-46d4-8f46-1b27d0beacac"><figcaption>Hisense S6 FollowMe display</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hisense</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-press-conference-live-190040504.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Hisense’s FollowMe display</a> is a screen that physically follows you around the room — which no one really asked for, but CES happily delivered anyway. Designed to reposition itself automatically so content stays in view, it feels like the logical endpoint of smart TVs becoming increasingly clingy. We haven’t seen it in action yet, but the idea of a display that refuses to be ignored is deeply on brand for 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a launch later this month, Volvo has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/media/images/ca4cd727e9c5475c9f59b3cb0108c259/">teased</a> some impressive details about its upcoming electric crossover. The EX60, which slots between the EX40 and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvos-ex90-suv-was-mostly-worth-the-wait-153035616.html">EX90</a>, will offer an EPA range of 400 miles, beating all other Volvos and most EVs in general. It will also be the first Volvo car to use a megacasting process designed to reduce weight and boost manufacturing efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car,&quot; said Volvo CTO Anders Bell. &quot;The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a59882d0-ec80-11f0-a9f7-2f5506db2938" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a59882d0-ec80-11f0-a9f7-2f5506db2938" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Volvo EX60 Electric crossover" data-uuid="f9ec65c5-11b7-30f8-b2ae-12005b1b3c79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure>
<p>Volvo considered that main worry to be range anxiety, so it focused on maximizing endurance to the largest extent possible. Key to that is Volvo&#39;s advanced SPA3 EV architecture, which integrates the battery directly into the structure of the car with cell-to-body technology. Volvo also developed its e-motors in-house to improve efficiency and reduce weight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company also made the EX60 fast to charge with an 800-volt electrical system and support for up to 400kW fast charging, letting you add up to 168 miles of range in just 10 minutes. New lighter materials and lower heat generation aid in that, &quot;meaning the EX60 can add over 100 miles or range in just a few minutes,&quot; Volvo wrote on its blog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The megacasting, meanwhile, helped Volvo replace hundreds of smaller parts with a single, high-precision casting to reduce weight. The Volvo EX60 will be revealed on January 21, 2026 at a livestream on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/news/articles/ex60-reveal-livestream/">Volvo&#39;s website</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvos-ex60-electric-crossover-promises-400-miles-of-epa-range-130008964.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a move that should surprise nobody, Google is stuffing more Gemini AI into Gmail. A host of new features, some of which are already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/personalized-ai-powered-smart-replies-are-coming-to-gmail-172422777.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">familiar to Workspace users</a>, are rolling out today for Gmail users in the US. Some are free, while others require a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html" data-i13n="slk:Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription;cpos:2;pos:1">Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription</a>.</p><p>The first premium feature is AI Overviews, the same name as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/15-billion-people-see-googles-ai-overviews-each-month-174526822.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a similar feature in Google Search</a>. Gmail’s version lets you ask questions about your messages in the search bar, using natural language. Google uses the example of, &quot;Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?&quot; It’s hard to imagine that saving much time over a basic search for &quot;plumber quote&quot; or “plumbing estimate,” but maybe it could help in some situations.</p><p>There&#39;s also a free portion of AI Overviews that summarizes mail threads for easy catch-ups. However, the ability to ask your inbox questions requires a subscription.</p><p>Meanwhile, Proofread is a subscription-only feature that&#39;s essentially <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/grammarlys-ai-writing-assistance-tools-now-work-in-five-new-languages-180432231.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Grammarly</a> for Gmail. As you&#39;d guess, it suggests improvements in grammar, word choice, conciseness, voice and sentence structure.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Gmail_AI_Inbox_Image.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Gmail_AI_Inbox_Image.png" style="height:720px;width:1280px;" alt="Google marketing image for an AI catch-up feature coming to Gmail." data-uuid="f6451048-d870-4f11-bdea-769dc3219221"/><figcaption>AI Inbox</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Finally, there&#39;s the AI Inbox, a feature that &quot;filters out the clutter so you can focus on what&#39;s most important.&quot; Google says it&#39;s like a personal briefing that flags to-dos and catches you up on what it thinks is most important. (It identifies VIPs based on frequent contacts, your contact list, and inferred relationships.) The company claims, without adding further detail, that this all &quot;happens securely with the privacy protections you expect from Google.&quot; AI Inbox is another subscription-only feature.</p><p>Now onto the free stuff. Help Me Write is a tool for all Gmail users that generates email copy from a prompt. This kind of thing should be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/proton-mail-now-has-a-privacy-focused-ai-writing-assistant-155816223.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">well-familiar by now</a>, as Big Tech increasingly encourages users to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/whatsapp-is-the-latest-to-offer-an-ai-powered-writing-assistant-182116369.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">avoid drafting anything from scratch</a>. And Suggested Replies can draft replies for you that mimic your tone and style. (Google describes it as a next-gen version of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-launches-geminis-contextual-smart-replies-in-gmail-140021232.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Smart Replies</a>.) Help Me Write and Suggested Replies are rolling out to everyone (no subscription required) today.</p><p>The new Gemini-powered features begin rolling out to Gmail today. Although they&#39;re starting with English speakers in the US, Google says they&#39;ll arrive in more languages and regions &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gmail-is-getting-a-gemini-ai-overhaul-130000422.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-redesigned-disney-app-is-rolling-out-to-more-users-in-the-us-204759533.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Disney+</a> will add vertical videos to its service in the US sometime this year, in hopes that they can entice viewers to engage with its app every day. The company has made the announcement at its Tech + Data Showcase event at CES 2026. Disney first dabbled in vertical content with Verts, which launched for the ESPN app in August 2025, giving it the insight it needed on how its users respond to the video format. </p><p>Erin Teague, Disney Entertainment’s EVP of Product Management, told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/disney-plus-vertical-videos-ces-1236665836/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Deadline</em></a> that the company will use the format for all kinds of content. The service isn’t just planning to use it as a vehicle for movie and series teasers, but also for original short-form programming. She didn’t say what kinds of original programming Disney+ will be adding as vertical videos to its app, but vertical micro-dramas have become incredibly popular over the past year. </p><p>“We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Teague said. “So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience.” The company is targeting Gen Z and Gen Alpha users, in particular, since they’re not inclined to sit and watch long-form content on their phones for hours. Disney said in a statement that the experience will “evolve as it&nbsp;expands across news and entertainment” and will be personalized for users, with making the service “a must-visit daily destination” as its goal. After all, if a user is already in the app, they’re more likely to explore and watch the service’s programming. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-is-launching-vertical-videos-this-year-120000776.html?src=rss]]></description>

A spokesperson told the publication that the company will keep Ballie around as an &quot;active innovation platform&quot; internally. &quot;After multiple years of real-world testing, it continues to inform how Samsung designs spatially aware, context-driven experiences, particularly in areas like smart home intelligence, ambient AI and privacy-by-design,&quot; the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGDF5R20tkM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>There’s a sliver of a chance that Samsung will eventually bring Ballie to market, but that seems unlikely as things stand.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past year or two to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> 
<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> 
<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-writing-and-latency">Writing and latency</h3> 
<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading">Reading</h3> 
<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> 
<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> 
<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-search-functionality">Search functionality</h3> 
<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> 
<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity">Sharing and connectivity</h3> 
<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> 
<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> 
<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to &quot;increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: &quot;We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We&#39;ve communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> 
<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that&#39;s for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn&#39;t great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It&#39;s also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p>

The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> 
<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html">Smart Paper</a>, but it&#39;s too pricey and too married to the company&#39;s companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn&#39;t as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo&#39;s cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=57f41413-eec2-4d90-9c25-26d144b737b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Boox+Tab+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shop.boox.com/products/tab">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss]]></description>

The new accessories include improved visual interfaces, faster Qi2 wireless charging and “upgraded ecosystems” that support the latest iPhones. Some of the latest devices are even available to buy right now.</p>
<p>First up is the Anker Nano Charger with smart display, which features a tiny screen, 180-degree foldable prongs and provides up to 45W of power. The plug can identify the exact iPhone model connected and then deliver the right amount of power for your phone. Anker says the Nano uses three-stage power delivery and a "Care Mode" that the company claims keeps batteries cooler than some competing 45W chargers. It arrives in late January 2026 and will retail for $40.</p>
<p>For fans of wireless charging stations, the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station offers a 3-in-1 solution for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. It uses a "AirCool" system for "faster, safer performance" and offers up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. The design is also foldable for compact travel. It's set for release in Q1 2026 and will retail for $150.</p>
<p>The company debuted a clamp-on 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip with 70W of output and built-in surge protection. It sports two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and six AC outlets. The Nano Power Strip is getting a late January release, and it will sell for $70.</p>
<p>Anker also unveiled a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station. This serves as an all-in-one hub with support for up to three displays (with 4K resolution supported on a single display), up to 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between connected devices. It also features a removable 6-in-1 hub with SD and microSD card readers, a USB-A port and a 5 Gbps USB-C port. The Nano Docking Station is available now and retails for $150.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every fall, dozens of maple and oak trees in my neighborhood shed their leaves. Thus begins the constant drone of gas-powered leaf blowers every day through early December. The noise is by far the most annoying thing about these yard tools, but I can appreciate it’s a necessary evil — unless you prefer to pick up a blister-inducing rake. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.whisper.aero/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Whisper Aero</a> argues there’s a better way. The company is using aerospace tech to quiet the noisy devices, introducing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://toneoutdoors.com/products/t1" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the T1</a> leaf blower <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">at CES 2026</a> under its sub-brand Tone Outdoors. The company promises the T1 is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading” handheld gas leaf blowers. More specifically, the T1 has 880 CFM of air flow, which easily surpasses my battery-powered EGO. And at 52 decibels of average noise at peak volume, his model is drastically quieter than any leaf blower I’ve used. I was able to confirm its lower roar on the CES show floor. </p>
<p>Tone says the T1 also offers extended run time of up to 50 minutes on a charge in Eco mode. That too is greater than what I get on my mid-grade EGO. What’s more, the company plans to sell a battery backpack that will extend any clean-up sessions for several hours. The T1 also has a built-in LED “nightlight” so you can still use it after dark. And since it’s quieter than what you have now, you can do so without annoying your neighbors.</p>

<p>So, how does Whisper Aero achieve this? The company originally set out to devise a quieter solution for electric aerospace motors. Its engineers discovered that they could dramatically reduce noise and increase overall efficiency by redesigning the fan and motor. They&#39;re still pursuing that, but the company discovered its technology had other uses too.</p>
<p>The T1 is already available for preorder for $599 and it’s scheduled to ship in September. If you don’t care for the standard green color, you can spend another $100 for limited edition “Silence Is Golden” version. The battery backpack won’t arrive until Q1 2027 though (price TBD). Tone also says it has additional models in the works and it has a partnership with Stanley Black and Decker that will likely produce additional products with this tech on board. </p>

According to the tech company, the transition to the new provider should take about two years to complete, but customers can continue to use their Apple Cards as usual during the interim.&nbsp;Apple has already published an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://learn.applecard.apple/transition" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">FAQ</a> about the change, but the main takeaway is that the status quo is currently continuing and customers will receive information at a later date if any action is required. Mastercard will remain the Apple Card payment network under the new partnership.</p><p>Goldman Sachs was Apple&#39;s collaborator when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-apple-card.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">launched</a> the Apple Card in 2019.

Apple didn&#39;t disclose many details around either the current or future deals for its credit card, however the <em>WSJ</em> report claims the negotiations with JPMorgan Chase have been underway for more than a year. Sources told the publication that Goldman Sachs is offloading about $20 billion in outstanding customer balances at a discount of more than $1 billion. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/jpmorgan-chase-is-taking-over-the-apple-card-232711979.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re off-roading, it’s a neat idea to use your engine to top up your battery, which prompted <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/3-big-announcements-from-bluetti-at-ces-2022-175050612.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Bluetti</a> to launch the Charger. You could hook it to your alternator and draw off energy as you drove to make sure you turned up to your campsite with full batteries. But if you’re also toting around solar panels on your roof, then it’s a shame you can’t also use that power to top up. This omission is what prompted Bluetti to turn up to CES 2026 with the Charger 2, which will take power from your engine and your solar panels at the same time.</p>
<p>Bluetti says the Charger 2’s dual-input architecture will accept 600W from the panels, 800W from the engine. All of that power will charge your batteries significantly faster than the first model, claiming it’s 13 times faster than a standard car charger. In addition, Charger 2 can manage more than one Bluetti power station and expansion batteries, should your power needs stretch. And the system is smart enough to know where the energy is coming from, managing the sources based on their availability. Plus, you can use it to jump start your engine should you need the help.</p>
<p>If you’re a Charger 1 owner and want to upgrade, it’s fairly painless to drop the old unit out in favor of its replacement. It uses the same cabling, so you can just hook the new model to your existing wires without having to get your fingers greasy. To reward that loyalty, the company will sell you an upgrade for $99, at least through February 7.</p>
<p>As for everyone else, you’ll be able to pick up the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-charger-2-alternator-solar-charger__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!Hup4QHaXiZAbBDrGvP6h21bZMpjKBCUfVIDR6_cFCutNYL_1H4cib59rfAOCtgC471jXE43c_TlNZ8eaMK3q$" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Charger 2</a> for $349 through February 7, at which point the price leaps to $499.</p>

In this episode, Devindra chats with Engadget&#39;s Dan Cooper about Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and the sad state of the PC industry. We&#39;ve got some new CPUs, but the volatile RAM market will likely make everything expensive this year. Also, they dive into Dell&#39;s revival of the XPS brand, as well as iPolish&#39;s smart nails and Subtle&#39;s AI-powered VoiceBuds.</p><div><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:200px;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/VzZrFoPk" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen data-provider-name="iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><h2 id="jump-link-subscribe"><strong>Subscribe!</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b2a3988-c5c9-4640-8e2b-1de7b2717343&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=18e5fc2c-eb4a-471c-ad66-982d59bd2ee0&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=iTunes&amp;linkText=iTunes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2l0dW5lcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtZW5nYWRnZXQtcG9kY2FzdC9pZDExNDI3OTA1MzA_bXQ9MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMThlNWZjMmMtZWI0YS00NzFjLWFkNjYtOTgyZDU5YmQyZWUwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2l0dW5lcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtZW5nYWRnZXQtcG9kY2FzdC9pZDExNDI3OTA1MzA_bXQ9MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfN0eXyQpRDBg746vMkFJwRTpOl0Oc3as8SInBosdcXy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-engadget-podcast%2Fid1142790530%3Fmt%3D2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:iTunes;elmt:;slk:iTunes;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2">iTunes</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=18e5fc2c-eb4a-471c-ad66-982d59bd2ee0&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Spotify&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL29wZW4uc3BvdGlmeS5jb20vc2hvdy8zRUMzZE1JUkI5OWRrdm9TQmVTTzdHP3NpPWY3VUFMR0ttUkRXdE9yVThaNC11aVEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE4ZTVmYzJjLWViNGEtNDcxYy1hZDY2LTk4MmQ1OWJkMmVlMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuLnNwb3RpZnkuY29tL3Nob3cvM0VDM2RNSVJCOTlka3ZvU0JlU083Rz9zaT1mN1VBTEdLbVJEV3RPclU4WjQtdWlRIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZSqMBEpkb3QQ83eoFHGy64huEABXXN5QZ-17RT7XsEq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fshow%2F3EC3dMIRB99dkvoSBeSO7G%3Fsi%3Df7UALGKmRDWtOrU8Z4-uiQ" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;slk:Spotify;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://open.spotify.com/show/3EC3dMIRB99dkvoSBeSO7G?si=f7UALGKmRDWtOrU8Z4-uiQ">Spotify</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link" href="http://pca.st/mlY3" data-i13n="slk:Pocket Casts;cpos:3;pos:1">Pocket Casts</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link" href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/engadget/the-engadget-podcast" data-i13n="slk:Stitcher;cpos:4;pos:1">Stitcher</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" class="linkDecorator_linkStyle__yM-Nh link" href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6MjQ1MjIwOTU4L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M&amp;ep=14" data-i13n="slk:Google Podcasts;cpos:5;pos:1">Google Podcasts</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="jump-link-topics">Topics</h2><ul><li><p>The state of the PC industry in 2026 -- 02:22</p></li><li><p>Intel&#39;s new Core Ultra Series 3 chips -- &nbsp;12:41</p></li><li><p>Dell&#39;s XPS lineup is back -- 17:41</p></li><li><p>Our favorite products from &nbsp;CES: 26:36</p></li></ul><h2 id="jump-link-credits"><strong>Credits</strong></h2><p><strong>Hosts:</strong> Devindra Hardawar and Dan Cooper<br><strong>Producer:</strong> Devindra Hardawar<br><strong>Music:</strong> Dale North</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/engadget-podcast-ces-2026-and-the-rocky-year-ahead-for-the-pc-industry-221500019.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Display is the part of its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gear/samsung/">giant parent company</a> that makes OLEDs, LCDs and other screens for both Samsung devices and anyone else that can afford them. This year, it’s going all-in on OLEDs of the future. And that meant things like foldable displays with invisible creases, robots hurling basketballs at supertough OLED panels, and OLED screens packed into baffling form factors for no good reason.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-creases">Creases</h2>

<p>The “seamless” foldable display that might be a part of a future foldable iPhone disappeared from the booth during our tour, reappearing when it was time to leave. (This is an image provided by Samsung Display.) The device was labelled as an R&amp;D concept, but it somehow disguised the crease in the center of the main display, making the (unlabelled) Galaxy Z Fold on the left look like a messy first-iteration foldable. There&#39;s still a crease there Will it actually form part of Apple’s foray into foldables, or just part of the Z Fold 8?</p>

<p>This isn’t a record player you’ll ever buy. You don’t need an OLED display on the side of your wireless headphones, but you <em>could</em> have them. I liked the cute OLED pendants; a customizable near-future button badge, but a lot of this is just devices for the sake of making them.</p>
<p>The booth tour had a small segment dedicated to portable gaming OLED, adding more possibilities whether that’s an eye-sight for FPS games or extra HUD for the most important info.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-worlds-brightest-oled-tv">The world’s brightest OLED TV</h2>

<p>Reaching 4,500-nit brightness, I had to squint when sat in front of this beastly OLED. For reference, consumer-level TVs typically peak at around 2,700 nits. Compared to other display technologies, OLED can achieve deeper contrast and more accurate color reproduction, but it often lacks the brightness of rival TV technologies. Not for this prototype. Let me get my sunglasses.</p>

<p>I didn’t consider OLED displays to be more fragile than other display technology, but that didn’t stop Samsung Display from installing a robot arm that throws a basketball at a hoop with a backboard made of 18 foldable OLEDs. With a bang, making Samsung Display execs and engineers nearby increasingly anxious as the days of CES go on.</p>

<p>After Samsung  finally solved the problem of weight and thickness with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it made life hard for itself again with the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html">TriFold</a>, with 50 percent more foldable screen. But it&#39;s worth seeing how Samsung’s foldables have evolved over the past few years. A solid reminder that the first Galaxy Fold (2019) was beefy.</p>

<p>Samsung Display has begun mass production of its 360Hz QD-OLED panel, with new “V-Stripe” RGB pixel structures. Inside each pixel, subpixels are vertically aligned, which appears to improve the clarity of text edges and other small contrast objects. While it was framed at the booth as a boon for office workers, a corner was dedicated to gaming applications.</p>

<p>Digital cockpits are the lifeblood of a CES showfloor, and Samsung Display’s version is predictably loaded with yet more OLEDs. The centerpiece is a “Flexible L” display that flows into the dashboard. A dedicated 13.8-inch display on the passenger side also slides out of the dash.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-display-ces-2026-playful-demos-and-mysterious-prototypes-220407696.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s only been a few months since Meta announced that it would open its smart glasses platform to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-will-let-outside-developers-create-ai-powered-apps-for-its-smart-glasses-194159233.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">third-party developers</a>. But one startup at CES is already showing off how the glasses can help power an intriguing set of accessibility features.</p><p>Hapware has created <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hapware.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Aleye</a>, a haptic wristband that, when paired with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, can help people understand the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of the people they are talking to. The company says the device could help people who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent unlock a type of communication that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be available.</p><p>Aleye is a somewhat chunky wristband that can vibrate in specific patterns on your wrist to correspond to the facial expressions and gestures of the person you&#39;re talking to. It uses the Meta Ray-Ban glasses&#39;s computer vision abilities to stream video of your conversation to the accompanying app, which uses an algorithm to detect facial expressions and gestures.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/alleye_haptics.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/alleye_haptics.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The bumps on the underside of the Aleye vibrate to form unique patterns." data-uuid="630b1b6f-9919-4771-88aa-7e736d07bca4"/><figcaption>The bumps on the underside of the Aleye vibrate to form unique patterns.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>Users can customize which expressions and gestures they want to detect in the app, which also provides a way for people to learn to distinguish between the different patterns. Hapware CEO Jack Walters said in their early testing people have been able to learn a handful of patterns within a few minutes. The company has also tried to make them intuitive. &quot;Jaw drop might feel like a jaw drop, a wave feels more like a side to side haptics,&quot; he explains.</p><p>The app is also able to use Meta AI to give vocal cues about people&#39;s expressions, though Hapware&#39;s CTO Dr. Bryan Duarte told me it can get a bit distracting to talk to people while the assistant is babbling in your ear. Duarte, who has been blind since a motorcycle accident at&nbsp;the age of 18, told me he prefers Aleye to Meta AI&#39;s other accessibility features like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-rolling-out-live-ai-and-shazam-integration-to-its-smart-glasses-192602898.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Live AI</a>. &quot;It will only tell me there&#39;s a person in front of me,&quot; he explains. &quot;It won&#39;t tell me if you&#39;re smiling. You have to prompt it every time, it won&#39;t just tell you stuff.&quot;</p><p>Hapware has started taking <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hapware.com/preorder/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">pre-orders</a> for the Aleye, which starts at $359 for the wristband or $637 for the wristband plus a year subscription to the app (a subscription is required and otherwise will cost $29 a month). A pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses is also not included, though Meta has also been building a number of its own accessibility features for the device.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/this-haptic-wristband-pairs-with-meta-smart-glasses-to-decode-facial-expressions-214305431.html?src=rss]]></description>

This new feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps to ChatGPT in order to get more tailored responses to queries about their health. The company noted that there will be additional privacy safeguards for this separate space within ChatGPT, and said that it will not use conversations held in Health for training foundational models. ChatGPT Health is currently in a testing stage, and there are some regional restrictions on which health apps can be connected to the AI company&#39;s platform.</p><p>The announcement from OpenAI acknowledges that this new development &quot;is not intended for diagnosis or treatment,&quot; but it&#39;s worth repeating. No part of ChatGPT, or any other artificial intelligence chatbot, is qualified to provide any kind of medial advice. Not only are these platforms capable of making dangerously incorrect statements, but feeding such personal and private information into a chatbot is generally not a recommended practice. It seems especially unwise to share with a company that only bothered paying <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-forms-advisory-council-on-wellbeing-and-ai-183815365.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">even cursory lip service</a> to the psychological impacts of its product after at least one teenager used the chatbot <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to plan suicide</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-is-launching-a-new-dedicated-health-portal-210150083.html?src=rss]]></description>

With access to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a>, you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart  online trackers.</p>
<p>Although we strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Plenty of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running end-of-year deals that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

The handheld sports an impressive 6.6-inch external screen and an 8.1-inch flexible main display. Motorola hasn’t provided dimensions yet, so we don’t know how thick it is yet or how it compares to other foldables in that respect.</p><p>We do know, however, that it&#39;ll include support for the Moto Pen Ultra stylus. This is actually a fairly big deal, as Samsung <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/unpacked-2025-s-pen-shocker-galaxy-z-fold-7-loses-compatibility-with-stylus" data-i13n="slk:dropped the feature for the Z Fold 7;cpos:4;pos:1">dropped the feature for the Z Fold 7</a>.

Motorola says that &quot;more specifications will be shared in the coming months.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that while this is the company&#39;s first side-folding camera, Motorola has always made top-folding phones.

The days are gone when Apple users had to be content with the leavings from the Windows ecosystem — in 2026, all the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPN services</a> have secure, user-friendly iOS apps on par with every other platform. If you&#39;ve decided to add a VPN to your iPhone to stay anonymous online and change your virtual location, you&#39;ve got plenty of great choices.</p><p>Since you&#39;re here, chances are you&#39;re familiar with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the benefits of using a VPN</a>, including security on public Wi-Fi and the ability to explore streaming libraries in other countries. But you may still be daunted by the process of actually choosing, installing and configuring a VPN on your iPhone.</p><p>In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through the steps, including how to configure a VPN manually without going through a service. Check out my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">how to use a VPN</a> piece for more general information.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-choose-an-iphone-vpn"><strong>How to choose an iPhone VPN</strong></h2><p>One of the trickiest parts of installing an iPhone VPN is picking the right service. That brings us to our first pro tip: Don’t just go to the App Store and search on “VPN.” That will simply front-load whichever vendor(s) are paying for top placement (note the little “Ad” icon) as well as a laundry list of free services that come with big caveats. There are dozens of mobile VPNs out there, and many of them don&#39;t put the user first (for example, I reported last year on popular VPNs that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">failed to disclose shared security flaws</a>). Choosing hastily can leave you stuck with an iOS VPN that&#39;s either mediocre or actively harmful.</p><p>Before downloading an iPhone VPN, do some research into the provider&#39;s background. A dependable VPN should have a well-written customer support page, a clear timeline of its history and a way to tell at a glance who actually owns and operates it. Check the reviews on the app store — it should have at least several hundred, almost all 4s and 5s.</p><p>iPhone users have a particular advantage here: several VPNs let you download their iOS app and start using it without paying. You can use this free trial period to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">put the VPN through its paces</a>. Start by testing its speed using Ookla speedtest or a similar app. You should also use an IP address checker to make sure it isn&#39;t leaking; to confirm this, just check your phone&#39;s IP address before and after connecting to the VPN and make sure it&#39;s different the second time.</p><p>To keep things simple, my top recommendation for all platforms is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>. Out of all VPNs, it strikes the best balance of solid security, fast performance, useful features and a commitment to user privacy.

When it finishes downloading, open the app to grant permissions and finish setup. However, since there are a couple of potential sticking points, I&#39;ll run through the steps in more detail.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_4077.PNG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_4077.PNG" style="height:1334px;width:750px;" alt="Proton VPN on the iOS app store." data-uuid="17864b81-fdc9-4ada-9560-b47c54fe05ef"/><figcaption>Proton VPN on the iOS app store.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><ol><li><p>Open the App Store.</p></li><li><p>Tap the search bar and type in the name of your chosen VPN. Hit Search and look through the list of results. Be careful to pick the right one — there are some &quot;mockbuster&quot; VPNs that try to snare people looking for well-known names. As a rule, the one with the most reviews is the service worth using.</p></li><li><p>On the page for the VPN app, tap Get. Enter your Apple ID and password to begin the installation.</p></li><li><p>Once installation is complete, either tap Open in the App Store or find the new VPN icon on your home screen.</p></li><li><p>Create a VPN account with a username and password. Most services let you do this within the app, but you may have to shift temporarily to a browser, so make sure you&#39;ve got internet access.</p></li><li><p>Choose a subscription. If there&#39;s a free trial, grab it and use it to test the VPN. If not, or if it&#39;s already expired, choose a plan that fits your budget and needs. Longer-term plans tend to save you money on average, but cost more at the start.</p></li><li><p>On the VPN app, log in with your new credentials. You&#39;re now ready to get started.</p></li></ol><p>If you aren&#39;t interested in paying for software right now, you can still get an iOS VPN.

Even so, it&#39;s a good idea to look through the options — you may not end up using all of them, but many of them are vital security checks or important quality-of-life boosters.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_iOS_NetShield.PNG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_iOS_NetShield.PNG" style="height:1334px;width:750px;" alt="Proton VPN&#39;s NetShield content blocker on iOS." data-uuid="fddf8c6c-4e2f-4251-94a6-221457c077cb"/><figcaption>Proton VPN&#39;s NetShield content blocker on iOS.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Here are some quick steps to make sure you&#39;re getting the best performance. These settings are in different places on each VPN, but most can be found by clicking a button with a gear icon, or any page labeled &quot;settings&quot; or &quot;preferences.&quot;</p><ol><li><p>Turn on the kill switch. This will protect you from broadcasting any data the VPN hasn&#39;t encrypted. In the event the VPN suddenly disconnects, the kill switch also cuts off your internet connection.</p></li><li><p>Set the VPN to always reconnect automatically if it disconnects. The method for doing this varies between services, so check the VPN&#39;s help page. Some (like Proton VPN) have an always-on VPN setting in the app itself, while others (like ExpressVPN) handle it through iOS settings.</p></li><li><p>Configure split tunneling. Not many iPhone VPNs have this option, but if yours does, you can use it to let certain apps or websites skip the VPN tunnel. Make sure to only bypass the VPN on sites and apps that share no sensitive information, or that refuse to work with a VPN active (some banks are like this).</p></li><li><p>If your VPN has a feature for blocking ads and malware domains, I recommend using it — the worst it can do is not work. Some also include parental controls, in case you&#39;re setting up the VPN on your child&#39;s phone.</p></li><li><p>Create shortcuts. Sometimes called Profiles, this relatively common feature lets you connect to the VPN and open a certain website with one tap.</p></li><li><p>Decide when and how you want the VPN to send you notifications.</p></li><li><p>Check available protocols. It&#39;s almost always best to let the VPN pick for you, but if you want to choose for yourself, IKEv2 is generally the fastest.</p></li><li><p>Look over the server list to see what choices are available.</p></li></ol><p>When choosing a VPN server, think about what you need the VPN for. If you&#39;re just using it for privacy, pick the fastest server (or let the VPN app choose it for you). On the other hand, if you want to watch a movie or TV show that&#39;s only on streaming in another country, choose the fastest server in that country. If you&#39;re on a good VPN, it still shouldn&#39;t slow you down too much.</p><p>If you have the address of a VPN server and the necessary credentials, iOS lets you set up your own VPN and connect directly. This is less convenient than using a provider app, since you need to know the details about every server you connect to, but it&#39;s nice if you&#39;re worried about trusting your privacy to a third party. It can also be convenient for quickly accessing a work or school VPN from your phone. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_4075.PNG" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_4075.PNG" style="height:1334px;width:750px;" alt="Manually setting up a VPN connection on iOS." data-uuid="337e4deb-6426-4904-afb6-d6f66792990f"/><figcaption>Manually setting up a VPN connection on iOS.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><ol><li><p>Open the Settings app. Scroll down and tap <strong>General</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down again and tap <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong>. Tap the word <strong>VPN</strong> on the new page, then tap <strong>Add VPN Configuration</strong>. You should reach the screen shown above.</p></li><li><p>Make sure <strong>Type</strong> is set to IKEv2, then enter the <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Server</strong> and <strong>Remote ID</strong> for the server you&#39;re connecting to (plus the Local ID if there is one).</p></li><li><p>Your source for the server information should also have told you if it authenticates access with a username/password or certificate. Pick the correct option, then enter the credentials required.</p></li><li><p>Tap the <strong>Done</strong> button or the blue checkmark at the top-right of the screen.</p></li><li><p>You&#39;ll arrive back on the previous menu with your new VPN option available. Toggle it on to connect. To turn it off, return to the same menu and deactivate the switch.</p></li></ol><h2 id="jump-link-do-you-need-an-iphone-vpn"><strong>Do you need an iPhone VPN?</strong></h2><p>Whenever you get online, your internet service provider (ISP) assigns an IP address to your device — a unique fingerprint that follows you throughout the session. Your ISP may sell this knowledge to marketers to target ads at you, or in worse cases, collaborate with governments willing to violate their citizens&#39; rights to privacy.</p><p>When you use a VPN, though, your real IP address is hidden behind that of the VPN server, so nothing you do on the internet connects back to you. That&#39;s why I always advise using a VPN on any device, including iPhones, that connects to the internet. It&#39;s even more important on the unprotected public networks you sometimes find in cafes and hotels. On the fun side, you can also use a VPN to change your virtual location to show you different content libraries on Netflix and other streaming platforms.</p><p>One more thing: I often hear iPhone users ask whether they need a VPN, since iCloud Private Relay comes standard on iOS devices. Just to clear this up, iCloud Private Relay is not a VPN. As you can see from this <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">support page</a>, your ISP can still see your real IP address when it’s active.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Orlando, FL, lawsuit was filed by the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III, who used a <a target="_blank" class="link">Character.AI</a> chatbot tailored after <em>Game of Thrones&#39;</em> Daenerys Targaryen. The teen reportedly exchanged sexualized messages with the chatbot and occasionally referred to it as &quot;his baby sister.&quot; He eventually talked about joining &quot;Daenerys&quot; in a deeper way before taking his own life.</p><p>The Texas suit accused a <a target="_blank" class="link">Character.AI</a> model of encouraging a teen to cut his arms. It also allegedly suggested that murdering his parents was a reasonable option. After the lawsuits were filed, the startup changed its policies and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/characterai-launches-guided-stories-format-after-banning-teens-from-its-chatbots-133000131.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">banned users under 18</a>.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link">Character.AI</a> is a role-playing chatbot platform that allows you to create custom characters and share them with other users. Many are based on celebrities or fictional pop culture figures. The company was founded in 2021 by two Google engineers, Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas. In 2024, Google rehired the co-founders and struck a $2.7 billion deal to license the startup&#39;s technology.</p><p>On one hand, the settlements will likely compensate the victims&#39; families handsomely. On the other hand, not going to trial means key details of the cases may never be made public.

More specifically, it was designed to mimic the Single-8 from 1965, which was a rival unit to the Super 8. Fujifilm&#39;s latest device captures video, just like its retro inspiration.</p>

<p>However, this is an Instax and the line has primarily been dedicated to snapping and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilms-hybrid-instax-mini-evo-camera-has-double-the-resolution-of-past-models-091009145.html"><ins>printing out still images on the fly</ins></a>. The Evo Cinema can still do that, albeit in a slightly different way. Users shoot a video and the camera can convert a shot from the footage into an Instax print. That&#39;s pretty cool. The bad news? It requires some kind of QR code tomfoolery.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The camera also comes equipped with something called the Eras Dial, which has nothing to do with Taylor Swift and everything to do with adjusting various effects and filters to create footage &quot;inspired by different eras.&quot; There are ten &quot;eras&quot; to choose from, including a 1960s vibe. The filter levels here are adjustable. We&#39;ll have to take a look at some footage to see how everything translates.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A keyboard computer has always been on my wishlist — that is, a computer where the entire machine was stuffed into a keyboard. Perhaps I caught a glimpse of the Commodore 64 at an impressionable age, but regardless, the idea has always been intriguing to me. At <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">CES 2026</a>, HP is bringing that concept back with the new EliteBoard G1a, which is dubbed a “Next Gen AI PC.”</p><p>It&#39;s an IT administrator&#39;s dream: It looks a typical desktop keyboard, but it has the full power of a Copilot+ AI PC inside. You can equip it with Ryzen 5 or 7 CPUs and their embedded Radeon 800 GPUs, up to 64GB of RAM and as much as 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. All you need to do is add a monitor and a mouse, and you&#39;ve got a full-fledged desktop setup.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-1.jpg" style="height:1152px;width:2000px;" alt="HP EliteBoard keyboard PC." data-uuid="439d1f0c-eb33-45fe-85b1-738f81cb1276"/><figcaption>HP EliteBoard keyboard PC.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>The more I think about it, the more sad I am that the arc of the computing industry trended towards standardized desktops and laptops. There was a brief spark of interest with the UMPC (ultra mobile PC) trend in the 2000&#39;s, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-09-29-meet-the-second-generation-of-umpcs-shoulda-been-first.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Engadget covered extensively as a young blog</a>, as well as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-03-03-hands-on-with-asus-eee-keyboard.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ASUS&#39;s Eee keyboard</a>. But they couldn&#39;t survive the rise of the smartphone and tablet. It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard. </p><p>I was able to test out an early EliteBoard prototype, and while the experience wasn&#39;t perfect, it&#39;s still an intriguing computing option. I had trouble setting it up initially because it only had two USB-C ports on its rear, which meant I had to find a way to power it through one port and pass a video signal through the other.  Thankfully, my Anker USB-C charging hub was able to juice it up, and I also had a USB-C hub with an HDMI port, which allowed me to connect to my monitor.</p><p>Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC. Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-30-intel-compute-stick-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Intel&#39;s Compute Stick placed a functional PC in a much smaller case</a>, but unlike the failed product, the EliteBoard actually felt usable. I was able to load up several browser windows with tabs, edit a few photos and even play a few light games, like <em>Vampire Survivors. </em>And yes, typing on it felt pretty great too.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-3.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-3.jpg" style="height:1119px;width:2000px;" alt="HP EliteBoard keyboard PC." data-uuid="c8b26cc3-4e39-48a1-b2a2-3a7144417589"/><figcaption>HP EliteBoard keyboard PC.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>Since I was testing out prototype hardware, I agreed not to benchmark the EliteBoard. But from the performance I saw, it felt about the same an entry-level laptop. Basically, it&#39;s perfectly suited to its main task: Being a boring office computer. Back in my IT days, I certainly would have preferred deploying a few light keyboards instead of the tank-like Dell desktops we typically ordered.</p><p>While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC. There&#39;s a chance we could see one that&#39;s eventually meant for mainstream consumers. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s exactly, necessary, though. The whole concept of a desktop PC mainly appeals to tinkerers and IT folks. And for anyone who wants to get their hands on an EliteBoard soon, there&#39;s really nothing stopping you.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/hps-new-eliteboard-made-me-believe-in-keyboard-computers-again-033000022.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As power <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/in-2025-ai-and-evs-gave-the-us-an-insatiable-hunger-for-power-133000673.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">gets more dicey</a>, personal energy generation only gets more appealing. Shine’s compact turbine isn’t going to power your house any time soon (though Rachel Carr, the company’s co-founder told me they have plans in that direction) but it can suck up the energy required to refill a smartphone in as little as 17 minutes. Of course, what it can generate depends on wind speed. That same charge could take as long as 11 hours if there’s only a slight breeze. </p>
<p>That power curve, and its ability to operate at night, sets the turbine apart from solar panels. Of course, on a completely still day, the Shine as inert as a becalmed sailing ship but if the wind picks up even as little as a breeze, it gets to work making power. The turbine even automatically pivots on the included stand to face into the wind. </p>

<p>The Shine 2.0 looks like a thin space football and has a screw-off cap that reveals a hollow compartment for the stand and tie downs. The cap then doubles as a key to unlock the blades. It all weighs just three pounds, which is impressively light considering it also houses a 12,000mAh battery that can output up to 75 watts. This is the second version of the turbine and updates include a USB-C port instead of USB-A, as well as app connectivity. </p>
<p>The company claims you can set the entire thing up in around two minutes. I watched the Carr take the turbine from fully closed to unfurled and ready for the stand in about that long. Unfortunately, there was no wind rushing through the CES show floor so I couldn’t see it spin, but Carr was kind enough to spin it for me. </p>

<p>Possibly the most exciting part is Shine’s plan for more expansive power generation. Shine 3.0, which the company is working on now, will be a 100 to 300 watt system and grid-tied turbines are on the wish list. </p>
<p>Pre orders are now open for the Shine 2.0 through Indiegogo for $399 and units should begin shipping this spring. </p>
<p><strong>Update, January 7 2026, 4:00PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated to correct the wattage output and include the co-founder’s name.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The latest generation of smartglasses can create huge virtual screens without the need to lug around giant monitors are a real boon to frequent travelers. However, their specs aren’t often tailored to the needs of gamers, so at CES 2026, ASUS and XREAL partnered to make a pair with two very important features you don’t normally get from rivals.&nbsp;</p><p>The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are based on the existing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">XREAL One Pro</a>, so naturally they share a lot of the same components and specs including dual micro-OLED displays with a per-eye resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, three degrees of freedom (natively), 700-nit peak brightness, 57-degree FOV and built-in speakers tuned by Bose. However, the big difference on the R1s is that instead of maxing out with a 120Hz refresh rate, ASUS and XREAL’s collab goes all the way up to 240Hz. That’s a pretty nice bump, especially for people with older hardware or anyone who might not have access to a high refresh rate display or just doesn’t want to lower their standards while traveling.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG-Xreal-R1-lenses.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG-Xreal-R1-lenses.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses deliver 1,920 x 1,080 resolution to each eye with a 240Hz refresh rate and 57-degree FOV.

It’s designed to be a simple hub with two HDMI 2.0 jacks,&nbsp;one DisplayPort 1.4 connector and a couple of USB-C slots (one is for power), so you can quickly switch between multiple systems like your desktop and console with a single touch. That said, depending on the situation you might not even need the dock at all because the R1s can also be connected to compatible PCs or gaming handhelds like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-ally-review-a-fully-armed-and-operational-handheld-battle-station-133043986.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ROG Ally X</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> (see the synergy there?) directly via USB-C.&nbsp;</p><p>When I got to try them out at CES, the R1s delivered a very easy to use and relatively streamlined kit. At 91 grams, they are barely heavier than the original XREAL One Pro (87g) so they don’t feel too weighty or cumbersome. I also really like the inclusion of electrochromic lenses, which allow you to change the tint of the glasses with the touch of a button. This lets you adjust how much or little light you want to come in through the front to best suit your environment. And thanks to support for three DOF, you have the ability to pin your virtual screen in one location or let it follow you around.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG-XREAL-R1-side.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ROG-XREAL-R1-side.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="Of course, ASUS and XREAL couldn&#39;t resist putting RGB lighting on the ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses.

So depending on the title, when the R1s are connected to something like a gaming handheld, you might not be able to get there. Luckily, I had the chance to use the specs when connected to a PC as well, which let me really appreciate the smoothness you get from faster refresh rates. General image quality was also quite good thanks to the glasses’ 1080p resolution, so I had no trouble reading text or discerning small UI elements. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/R1-dock_6756.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/R1-dock_6756.jpg" style="height:1200px;width:1920px;" alt="The ROG Control dock makes it easy to connect multiple devices to the ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses, but it may be a bit too bulky to pull out in tight situations like on a plane.

That said, even with its current FOV, you can still create up to a 171-inch virtual screen at four meters away, which is massively bigger than any portable screen you might entertain carrying around.</p><p>Unfortunately, ASUS and XREAL haven’t announced official pricing or a release date for the R1s yet, but hopefully they won’t cost too much more than the XREAL One Pro, which are currently going for $649.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve never docked <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bmws-all-electric-luxury-boat-comes-with-a-custom-hans-zimmer-soundtrack-191052673.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a boat</a> before, consider yourself lucky. There are plenty of popular TikTok channels devoted to shaming those who bring their craft back home clumsily or berth them with something less than finesse. Tricky crosswinds, unpredictable surf and even the jeers of passersby can make it a stressful experience at the best of times.</p><p>Brunswick, which owns more than 50 water-borne brands like Sea Ray, Bayliner and Mercury Marine, has a solution. It&#39;s demonstrating some self-docking tech called AutoCaptain <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">at CES 2026</a> that makes this process a cinch, plus a fleet of other innovations that, in some cases, leave some of the smart cars on the show floor looking a bit remedial.</p><p>One of those technologies is edge AI. While in-car AI is an increasingly common feature, those agents are exclusively running remotely, relying on cellular connections to offload all the processing power required to drive a large language model.</p><p>Sadly, that won&#39;t always work on a boat.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026-SLX-360-Outboard-SXO360-aerial-overhead-underwater-accent-lighting-twilight-08558.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026-SLX-360-Outboard-SXO360-aerial-overhead-underwater-accent-lighting-twilight-08558.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="One of Brunswick&#39;s tech-equipped boats" data-uuid="b5209aa7-1244-4876-9f4d-3c8c09156f45"/><figcaption>One of Brunswick&#39;s tech-equipped boats</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Brunswick</div></figure><p>&quot;One of the things about AI for boats is you don&#39;t have connectivity, so there is some edge compute required,&quot; David M. Foulkes told me. He&#39;s chairman and CEO of Brunswick.</p><p>Many of the company&#39;s boats do have active cellular connectivity, but head far enough offshore, and you&#39;re on your own unless you&#39;re packing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/starlink-is-lowering-thousands-of-satellites-orbits-to-reduce-risk-of-collisions-030509067.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Starlink</a> or the like.</p><p>To solve that, Brunswick is running advanced SoCs from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">NVIDIA</a> and other providers that enable running a limited agent offline — on the edge, as it were. When offline, Misty, as the on-boat AI assistant is called, won&#39;t be able to make dinner reservations or craft a 3,000-word treatise on the history of America&#39;s relationship with Greenland. It can, however, help with navigation or boat settings.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;ll help answer the kind of questions that you might need to take out a manual to understand and maybe act as an assistant to make your boating a bit smoother,&quot; Foulkes said.</p><p>When the company&#39;s smart boats are connected, they offer some degree of remote control. No, you can&#39;t drive it around the docks and freak out your pier-mates, but you can check on the boat remotely to make sure nobody&#39;s trying to stow away. You can even precondition it to get the cuddy cabin nice and cool before you come aboard.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Brunswick2026_CES_NAVAN_C30_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Brunswick2026_CES_NAVAN_C30_2.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Navan C30" data-uuid="9579db36-10f1-448b-9078-f73807f3fb2f"/><figcaption>Navan C30</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>Power for that, and a variety of other onboard systems, can come from an integrated power system called Fathom, which has a lot in common with modern smart home tech. Solar panels on the roof (nicely disguised beneath a black mesh) collect power to recharge an onboard battery, with various sizes upwards of 30 kWh depending on the boat&#39;s size. That battery can also be recharged by the onboard motors, like the three 425-horsepower V10s the Sea Ray SLX 360 drydocked at the Brunswick booth at CES 2026.</p><p>The juice in that battery can then be used to power a variety of onboard systems, even charging a pair of electric hydrofoils, which another of the company&#39;s boats, called the Navan C30, had strapped on the roof.</p><p>You&#39;ll also find cameras on the roof of these boats. That&#39;s how the AutoCaptain feature works, numerous fisheye lenses scanning the water in every direction. Approach a pier and the AI assistant asks if you&#39;d like some help docking. Just tap the button on the touchscreen, then kick back and let Misty do the driving.</p><p>Between automated docking, the in-cabin AI assistant and the smart power distribution system, Brunswick&#39;s boats offered some impressive tech. But then they&#39;d have to, given the cost. The Sea Ray SLX 360 Outboard has a starting price of $586,000. The smaller Navan C30 is a rather more attainable, but still extreme, at $227,500. That’s still probably cheaper than hiring a real captain, though.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/brunswicks-latest-boats-at-ces-2026-feature-edge-ai-self-docking-capabilities-and-solar-power-185500213.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A startup called ReviMo has developed a robotic system that provides a way for people with limited mobility to lift and transfer themselves — like from a bed to a wheelchair, or to the toilet — without the assistance of a caregiver. ReviMo&#39;s Niko has two sets of arms: one that forms a &quot;scooping seat&quot; that slides underneath the person to lift them up, and the other encircling their torso and providing a backrest. It can be operated both by remote and using the controls on its dashboard. Niko in its current iteration can carry up to 250 pounds, but the team says it&#39;s working on a version that can support up to 400 pounds.</p><p>In addition to aiding in transfers, Niko can lift the rider to a standing level and offers retractable handlebars for support. It also has the potential to be a big help to caregivers, who in many cases assist with multiple transfers every day. Even in a situation where a person isn&#39;t able to operate it by themselves, Niko facilitates a transfer that requires much less physical exertion than today&#39;s common methods, like sling-based mechanical lift systems. At CES, founder Aleksandr Malaschenko gave a demonstration of its lifting capabilities, using it to scoop him up from a chair and bring him out into the aisle.&nbsp;</p><p>Niko is designed to work with most wheelchairs and be compact enough to navigate small bathrooms. It can position a person right above a toilet, and there are disposable seat covers. The goal is to help people with limited ability achieve more independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/k4ChKD34" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>It is the kind of device that, if it delivers on its promises, could be a game-changer for people with limited mobility and paralysis, and their loved ones. My dad was diagnosed with ALS when I was a kid, and I learned how to operate <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoI7Y8Q-2_A" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a Hoyer lift</a> by the time I was in middle school. This strikes me as something we would have really appreciated having around. Malaschenko has said the inspiration for the robotic system came from being a caregiver for his grandfather following a stroke.&nbsp;</p><p>Niko will cost about $15,000, though the team said it&#39;s working to get it covered by insurance. The company is also offering lower <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.revimo.care/pricing-plans/list" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">prices</a> for customers who sign up for one of its premium waitlists, and there are options to rent it for those who would only need a lift and transfer system temporarily.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/niko-is-a-robotic-lift-for-people-with-limited-mobility-that-doesnt-require-a-caregivers-help-184500703.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When LG announced that it would demo <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a laundry-folding</a>, chore-doing robot at CES 2026, I was immediately intrigued. For years, I&#39;ve wandered the Las Vegas Convention Center halls and wondered when someone might create a robot that can tackle the mundane but useful tasks I despise like folding laundry. With CLOiD (pronounced like &quot;Floyd&quot;), LG has proven that this is theoretically possible, but probably not likely to happen any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p>I went to the company&#39;s CES booth to watch its demonstration of CLOiD&#39;s abilities, which also include serving food, fetching objects and fitness coaching. During a very carefully choreographed 15-minute presentation, I watched CLOiD grab a carton of milk out of the fridge, put a croissant in an oven, sort and fold some laundry and grab a set of keys off a couch and hand them to the human presenter.</p><p>Throughout the demonstration, LG showed off how its own appliances can play along with the robot. When it rolled over to the fridge, the door automatically opened, as did the oven. When the LG-branded robot vacuum needed to move around a hamper, CLOiD helpfully cleared the path. But the robot also moved very slowly, which you can see in the highlight video below.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/Ij5PzDlj" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>The appliance maker is selling the setup as a part of its vision for a &quot;zero labor home&quot; where its appliances and, I guess, robotics technology can come together to take care of all your chores and household upkeep. Maybe I&#39;m jaded from a decade of watching CES vaporware, but I left the slick demo thinking the concept is unlikely to amount to much anytime soon.</p><p>On one hand, it is exciting to see robots competently performing tasks that would actually be useful to most people. But this technology is still far from accessible. Even LG isn&#39;t making any firm commitments about CLOiD&#39;s future as anything more than a CES demo. The company has instead said that CLOiD is a signal of its interest in creating &quot;home robots with practical functions&quot; and &quot;robotized appliances,&quot; like fridges with doors that can open automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>That may be a more reasonable target for the company (and yet another way for LG to sell us more appliance upgrades). But it&#39;s still pretty far from anything approaching the fantasy of a &quot;zero labor home.&quot;<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m no psychologist, but I get a sense Segway turned up to CES 2026 with something to prove after last year. Certainly, it’s gone out of its way to prove its micromobility bona fides with the press, who perhaps were a bit too sniffy that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-is-finally-launching-e-bikes-at-ces-2025-130015667.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">scooter people were launching an e-bike.</a> This year, Segway’s not just launching two more mainstream e-bikes, but an electric dirt bike, all of which are crammed with the sort of tech that might just make everyone halt their sniffiness.</p><p>First up, there’s the Myon, a chunky step-through with a decent-sized pannier rack for folks who want to go far and carry a bit of luggage as they go. That’s hardly an eye-catching proposition given so many e-bikes fit within the same template, but Segway is hoping its tech will make a difference here. Myon is equipped with electronic gear shifting (tied to a Shimano CUES chain drivetrain), electronic motor optimization and the company’s proprietary Intelligent Ride System.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter, along with Segway(TM) TurboTuned(TM) will automatically optimize motor and battery performance while under way. The company adds that the bike’s built-in gyros, cadence and torque sensors will meter out performance according to road conditions. So if you’re going up hill, the power will gently increase before you have to think about it. Additionally, if you stop at the lights, the system won’t just turn on the power to whatever you’ve set it at as soon as it senses the tiniest ounce of pressure on the pedal, removing the jerky start action you see in other bikes.</p><p>Segway’s broader pitch is that its bikes will also feature a whole host of smart features, including integration with Apple’s Find My network, GPS tracking, remote locking, integration with your health and fitness app of choice, and smartphone pairing.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg" style="height:5464px;width:8192px;" alt="Muxi" data-uuid="86d61664-366b-44f6-87b7-62c3c0830829"/><figcaption>Muxi</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Segway</div></figure><p>Muxi (pronounced <em>moo-shee</em>) is a more interesting piece of hardware, since it’s been built like a longtail cargo bike, but with the long tail chopped off. Even so, the focus is on cargo, with the bike getting an optional passenger seat with foot pegs, and an optional middle basket. Plus, the bike comes with a beverage cup holder (although given it has a direct drive motor, I’m not sure I’d want to cruise around at low speed while trying to sip my morning latte). To ensure you don’t struggle with your load, the bike comes with Hill Start Assist, Hill Descent Control, regenerative braking and traction control. Plus the aforementioned suite of added value features, like Find My integration, remote locking, GPS and the app integrations.&nbsp;</p><p>Rounding out the announcements is the Xaber (<em>say-br</em>) 300, an electric dirt bike geared toward off-roading. It has three power modes, letting you learn on the equivalent of a 150cc engine, then dialing that up to 200cc, before topping out at 300cc. If you still want a greater sense of control, you can activate an electronic clutch, and if you want to cede more of it to the bike, you can set the maximum wheelie angle. If you want to enjoy all of that dirt bikin’ action, it’ll set you back $5,300 when it arrives.</p><p>As for Myon, it’s available to buy today from Segway’s official site and via its dealer network, priced at $2,000. Muxi will be available through those same channels in March, setting you back $1,700.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;ve always kind of taken walking for granted. Other than a knee injury more than a decade ago, my ability to walk long distances has largely been limited only by my own choices. That&#39;s not the case for everyone, though. And robotics company Dephy has created a pair of robotic sneakers, called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.dephy.com/sidekick-starter-pack" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the Sidekick</a>, that are meant to help people who want to walk more than their bodies might otherwise be capable of.</p><p>The system consists of two parts: an ankle-worn exoskeleton and a special pair of sneakers that attach to it. The exoskeleton hooks onto the back of the shoe and is secured with a strap around your calf. The battery powered device is equipped with sensors that can detect and adapt to the wearer&#39;s gait in order to deliver an extra &quot;boost&quot; with each step.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole setup is pricey, at $4,500, but Dephy is betting that people who have &quot;personal range anxiety&quot; might be willing to pay for the extra confidence the Sidekick can provide. &quot;This is a device that&#39;s kind of like [having] an extra calf muscle,&quot; Dephy CEO Luke Mooney told me.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dephy_black_solo.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dephy_black_solo.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The Sidekick." data-uuid="fee8097e-cd10-4240-800d-8f5ed7bd2d2d"/><figcaption>The Sidekick.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p>I was able to take the Sidekick for a spin around the CES showfloor and it was a truly surprising sensation. The best way I can describe walking with the Sidekick powered on is that with every step forward there&#39;s a noticeable&nbsp;upward push from under your heel. It wasn&#39;t enough to throw me off balance, but it did feel a bit strange.</p><p>The Sidekick has adjustable power levels based on how much help you might need. At the highest level, it definitely felt unnecessarily pushy. The lower levels were still noticeable but felt less disruptive. I just felt… bouncy. Later, when Mooney turned off the power entirely, I noticed that my feet felt weirdly heavy in a way they hadn&#39;t just a few minutes before.&nbsp;</p><p>Mooney was quick to tell me that I&#39;m not Dephy&#39;s target demographic. &quot;A lot of times people who are fit, or like athletes, actually struggle to adopt to the technology because their body&#39;s so in tune with how they move,&quot; he said. &quot;Whereas folks who are not as physically active and fit, their body&#39;s ready to accept help.&quot;</p><p>The company&#39;s technology will be used in products more focused on athletic performance, however. Dephy has partnered with Nike on its upcoming robotic sneaker currently known as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nike-pitches-robotic-sneakers-and-mind-altering-mules-212716340.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Project Amplify</a>.&nbsp;Mooney declined to share details on the collaboration, but the shoemaker has claimed that some early testers have been able to improve their mile times by two minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried the Sidekick early in the day. Several hours later, though, when I was walking between the Las Vegas Conventions Center halls for the third or fourth time, I started thinking about those robotic sneakers again. I was getting close to 10,000 steps and hadn&#39;t sat down for hours. My feet were sore. I remembered that strange, bouncy boost and thought it sounded kind of nice.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/these-robotic-sneakers-gave-me-a-surprising-boost-at-ces-174500005.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-07/listening-activity-request-to-jam-messages-updates/"><ins>rolling out more social features</ins></a> to keep people on the platform. It&#39;s adding a new tool to its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-introduces-an-in-app-messaging-feature-134401088.html"><ins>messaging platform</ins></a> that lets users see what their friends and family members are listening to in real time.</p>
<p>Once activated, a user&#39;s listening activity will be displayed at the top of the chat. The other person in the chat can tap the bar to play a particular track, save it or react with an emoji. People can also, of course, comment directly to either praise or rag on the song selection.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s another little addition to Spotify&#39;s messaging system. Users will now be able to invite chat participants to start a Jam, which is the app&#39;s collaborative listening feature. Premium users will find a &quot;Jam&quot; button in the top right corner, which sends an invite. This lets two people add tracks to a shared queue and listen together. Free users can join one of these sessions, but cannot initiate.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the messaging platform is currently just a one-on-one affair. There&#39;s no option for a group chat, so users won&#39;t be able to spy on multiple people simultaneously. These tools are rolling out gradually for iOS and Android right now, but won&#39;t be broadly available for a few weeks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-now-lets-you-share-what-youre-listening-to-in-real-time-via-chat-173749120.html?src=rss]]></description>

They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb is a direct answer to my longstanding wish for more attractive (but <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-filament-g25-globe-e26-smart-bulb/046677563592#overview" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1">affordable</a>) smart bulbs. </p><p>One of my favorite of the new devices was the BILREA remote control. It’s a smooth, riverstone-like object that either comes with two simple buttons or a button and a scroll wheel. It pairs up with and controls IKEA’s smart devices and lamps but what I really love is the magnetic mount integrated into its body. You can either attach the remote to any ferrous surface or use the small metal chip and included adhesive to give the remote a home on a wall or elsewhere. Why have so few other companies come up with a way to neatly and simply organize these tiny yet crucial controllers? </p><p>The whole suite is Matter-compatible and, as such, it needs a hub to function. IKEA has its own, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e43990ba-ed42-4a73-87a7-cd68b5f3d000&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=39c98f7d-37cf-4932-97e8-3c0d15f76bc7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=IKEA&amp;linkText=DIRIGERA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pa2VhLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2RpcmlnZXJhLWh1Yi1mb3Itc21hcnQtcHJvZHVjdHMtd2hpdGUtc21hcnQtNTA1MDM0MTQvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOWM5OGY3ZC0zN2NmLTQ5MzItOTdlOC0zYzBkMTVmNzZiYzciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlrZWEuY29tL3VzL2VuL3AvZGlyaWdlcmEtaHViLWZvci1zbWFydC1wcm9kdWN0cy13aGl0ZS1zbWFydC01MDUwMzQxNC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbcQuXJGqKiWGt4FaQrhzA6fRyX8LWnEFkzoRMXJ6Zk8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fdirigera-hub-for-smart-products-white-smart-50503414%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:IKEA;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/dirigera-hub-for-smart-products-white-smart-50503414/">DIRIGERA</a>, but, true to the Matter principles of interoperability, you can also use a Matter hub you already own. The new line of smart home devices should start showing up in IKEA stores and on its website sometime in January. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_lamps_and_speakers.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_lamps_and_speakers.jpg" style="height:1491px;width:2650px;" alt="Lamps and speakers from the TEKLAN smart home collection." data-uuid="62bdb120-68d9-401a-9f08-04ff10b53431"><figcaption>Lamps and speakers from the TEKLAN smart home collection.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Apart from the egalitarian and utilitarian items, the Swedish brand also brought a new collection of products, TEKLAN, designed in collaboration with designer and photographer Tekla Evelina Severin. These include circular Bluetooth speakers in color-saturated patterns and solids ranging from eight to 18 inches. There are also two new speaker lamps, called KULGLASS, that have glass lampshades inspired by soft serve ice cream. Those devices went on sale on January 1 this year.</p><p>Finally, I made my way (three feet) over to the curious, donut-shaped lamps. This is the smart version of the store’s popular VARMBLIXT lamp that debuted three years ago. It’s controllable through the app or the remote I mentioned above and gently cycles through a rainbow of color patterns, shifting slowly from shade to shade. I got lost for a while watching it morph from white to pink to red and back again. For a moment I forgot I was wedged into a room too full of people. I figured those around me probably wanted a look at the lamp for themselves, so I took a longing glance back at the BELÖNING bowl and squeezed out of the room. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_donut_lamp.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikea_donut_lamp.jpg" style="height:1807px;width:3213px;" alt="The popular VARMBLIXT donut lamp is now smart.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m fascinated by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/a-105000-robot-arm-nobody-needs-cooked-me-a-delicious-lunch-140050065.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">AI cooking robots</a> which, as far as I’m concerned, automate the one fun bit of cooking. Sadly, it’s far easier to make something that can stir a pan of ingredients as they cook compared to building something that would successfully peel a carrot. Nosh is the latest unit to use CES to announce itself to the world, gearing up for its launch in the next few months. Like its many rivals, you load ingredients into the unit and then Nosh will assemble them for you. Unlike its many rivals, you can have more than one ingredient tray, opening up the possibility that you could prep multiple meals at the same time.</p><p>Even if you’re not familiar with the category you can guess how this thing works: You’ll select a recipe from the hardware’s 500-dish strong repertoire. Then you’ll prepare the necessary raw materials and slide them into individual compartments in the trays. Once done, you’ll be able to push the tray into the unit when you’re ready to eat and let it get on with the job of cooking. There are water and oil reservoirs,  a spice rack mounted in the top, and a camera that uses computer vision to keep an eye on the meals as they cook. As each morsel is added, a mixer arm spins to ensure the food never stays in one place for too long.&nbsp;</p><p>From the marketing materials (as well as my own common sense) it’s clear Nosh works best with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://us.letsnosh.io/recipes-nosh" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">sauce heavy meals</a>. Pasta dishes, soups and curries will work pretty well in the system, which may limit how often you’ll want to use it across a regular week. That said, the idea of having this as a low-effort alternative to pre-prepared meals from the oven or microwave is preferable.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/follow-the-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-right-here-130005940.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lego</a> bricks come in a bunch of shapes and sizes, but they’re getting a big technical upgrade in 2026 thanks to news announced at CES this year. Meet the Lego Smart Brick, a standard-sized 2 x 4 brick that’s packed with modern technology to enable sets that can respond to how they’re played with or the sets you build. The company’s new initiative, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6354879d-871a-4410-855d-b4db770893fe&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2MzU0ODc5ZC04NzFhLTQ0MTAtODU1ZC1iNGRiNzcwODkzZmUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfP_aTDlIXUJrcSpv8DAU4bDzX0WVIU1j63Uxwwc1HbZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play">Smart Play</a>, encompasses the Smart Brick as well as Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags. It’s remains to be seen how diehard Lego fans will take to this new system, but it’s fair to say this is the biggest move Lego has ever made to infuse its products with connected technology.</p>
<p>The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside of it that Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It runs something called the Play Engine that can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields. Thanks to this and some integrated copper coils, the Smart Brick can sense distance, direction and orientation of other Smart Bricks near it when you’re building. The brick also has a tiny built-in speaker, an accelerometer and an LED array. Lego says the speaker can produce audio that is “tied to live play actions” rather than just playing pre-recorded clips. </p>
<p>The Smart Tag and Smart Minifigures are a lot simpler. The Tag is a 2 x 2 studless tile with a digital ID embedded in it that the Smart Brick can read via “near-field magnetic communication.” This obviously sounds a lot like NFC, but we can’t be sure that these new Lego pieces will be able to communicate with any other NFC devices. Similarly, the Smart Minifigure also has a digital ID readable by NFC. </p>
<p>The purpose of the Smart Tag as well as the similar tech in a Smart Minifigure is to let the Smart Brick know what kind of context it is being used in. As Lego puts it, “The role of the Smart Tag is to tell the Smart Brick how it should play back with you.” The Tag tells the Brick what kind of object, animal, vehicle and so forth it should become. A Smart Tag in a Lego Star Wars X-Wing set, for example, will contain the unique ID and instructions for how the Smart Brick should behave.</p>
<p>If this isn’t enough, Lego has also built a local wireless layer that connects this all together called BrickNet. It’s based on Bluetooth and uses Lego’s proprietary “Neighbor Position Measurement&quot; system, which is what lets the Smart Bricks know how close they are to each other and how they’re oriented. Lego says that this lets the bricks “talk” to each other directly without the need for apps, internet connections or external controls. It sounds like the idea is all three of these new Smart pieces can communicate and interact without any need for setup, which should make it refreshingly like a traditional Lego set.</p>
<p>That said, these bricks naturally will need some power. Lego says that their batteries should still perform even after “years” of inactivity, and the coils and power system is designed so that multiple bricks can be charged wirelessly on a shared charging pad.</p>

<p>Speaking of sets, Lego is unsurprisingly launching the Smart Play system with its biggest licensed partner: Star Wars. There will be three “all-in-one” Star Wars sets available, all of which are on the smaller side and definitely geared towards kids, rather than the 1,000 piece and up sets that the company has released to get adults (like me) interested.</p>
<p>The prices are inflated compared to non-smart sets, but not outrageously so. Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter is a 473-piece set with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, priced at $70. Luke’s Red Five X-Wing is a 584-piece set with two Smart Minifigures, one Smart Brick and five Smart Tags, priced at $100. The Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing is a 962-piece set with three Smart Minifigures, two Smart Bricks and five Smart Tags, priced at a slightly shocking $160. </p>
<p>It’s an entirely new direction for Lego, and you won’t have to wait long to check it out. The company is putting those three sets up for pre-order on January 9, and they’ll launch on March 1. There’s obviously a lot of technology here that’s entirely new to Lego, and as such it’s hard to imagine just how this will all look when it comes together — but we’re hoping that Lego will have some sets on hand here at CES so we can get a closer look at how the Smart Play system works.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been six years since Sony first rolled out its prototype car at CES 2020. It was called the&nbsp; <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-sony-vision-s.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Vision-S</a> back then, and I remember everyone endlessly debating just how serious the consumer electronics powerhouse was about making a car. Over the subsequent half-decade, Sony has proven it is not only serious, but absolutely hell-bent on making this thing a reality.</p><p>At CES 2026, we&#39;re still somehow about 12 months away from that car hitting the roads. Now called the Afeela 1, instead of being built by Sony proper it will come from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility. It will start at $89,900, offer around 300 miles of range, and wear an exterior design so sedate that even the 31.5-inch-wide &quot;Media Bar&quot; micro-LED integrated into the nose barely makes an impact.</p><p>With the Afeela up on stage again this year, what&#39;s new in 2026? I&#39;m fresh from getting a closer look at the sedan here in Las Vegas and, sadly, there&#39;s little more to see than what so <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">underwhelmed me last year</a>. From the outside, 2026&#39;s Afeela looks nigh identical to 2025&#39;s, save for one change: I&#39;m happy to report that the unfortunate seam running down the middle of last year&#39;s nose-mounted Media Bar has been fixed. It now appears to be a single, contiguous panel.</p><p>On the inside, the interior seems to have a higher degree of fit and finish than last year&#39;s. To get in, you either push on a little button hidden in the trim or pull out the smartphone app and request that the door open automatically. There are no door latches as such, something that might raise a few eyebrows given <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-is-investigating-tesla-over-its-electronic-door-handles-203605393.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Tesla&#39;s current door handle woes</a>. (I was told there are physical door releases hidden below the car on the outside, and low in the door card on the inside.)</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%2813%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%2813%29.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026" data-uuid="590c0464-f273-4806-9905-e3c4d3a067be"/><figcaption>Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>The door closes automatically once you&#39;re inside, instantly hushing the manic drone of the crowd on the always-packed CES floor. This creates a great soundscape for the whopping 28 speakers Sony is deploying here. The car&#39;s interior shape was actually designed to optimize the placement of those speakers, and the few moments of music I heard were impressive.</p><p>There&#39;s Dolby Atmos support, so you can take full advantage of the spatial audio features in the cockpit. You can even toggle the sound on or off for individual seats, perhaps helping a little one stay asleep in the back seat — or simply sparing your kids from the depths of your guilty pleasure playlist.</p><p>The most noticeable feature inside the car, though, is the sweeping display that runs across the dashboard. There&#39;s a 12.3-inch LCD gauge cluster on the left conjoined with a 28.5-inch display that goes all the way to the right. Sony&#39;s infotainment software effectively splits that rightmost panel in two, enabling you or the passenger to drag apps left or right as needed.</p><p>Media or other distracting apps running on the passenger&#39;s side of the display will trigger an integrated privacy shield, blacking it out ensuring minimal distraction for the driver. But Sony is still pushing the envelope a bit here in a few other areas. You can dial into Zoom meetings from the driver&#39;s seat, for example, and while the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the first car to do this (Mercedes-Benz included the service in the car in its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-e-class-puts-220120865.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">2024 E-Class</a>), Sony will actually let the driver participate in the video while driving. This seems a little unnecessary to me.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%2819%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%2819%29.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026" data-uuid="e39a7477-a436-4179-a934-665aecd65318"/><figcaption>Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>Zoom uses the ceiling-mounted camera, one of 40 sensors in and around the Afeela 1. That includes the pods for a LiDAR sensor and more cameras protruding rather conspicuously from the roof. These sensors will provide Level 2+ driver assistance at launch. Over time, Sony promises to upgrade the car to Level 4, meaning that you, the driver, could theoretically take a nap behind the wheel. The car certainly looks to have enough sensors and processing power to make that work, but as we saw with Tesla&#39;s Full Self Driving, these sorts of automotive upgrades have a tendency to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-v9-beta-release-date-170921380.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">take longer than anticipated</a>.</p><p>Some of that digital processing power comes courtesy of Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon Digital Chassis, which also powers the infotainment experience. The software that runs the dashboard and rear seat experience looked far more comprehensive than before. That includes a functional AI voice assistant providing advanced routing guidance, like telling you which of the dozen taquerias on your route has the best guac.</p><p>Personalization is a big part of the sales pitch here, with downloadable packages changing everything from the car&#39;s ambient lights to the gauge cluster, engine sound, and even whatever&#39;s displayed on the nose-mounted display.</p><p>The idea here is to give you an emotional connection with the car -- despite its decidedly emotionless exterior design.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%289%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%289%29.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026" data-uuid="75d1a1f9-403f-4d6e-b6dc-e86406c1bed0"/><figcaption>Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;Our brand, Afeela, is built on a vision to redefine the relationship between people and mobility,&quot; Izumi Kawanishi, Sony Honda Mobility&#39;s president and COO, said. &quot;Being in a car will no longer be about driving. It will be about making the most of your time and space while you move.&quot;</p><p>I got to sample a number of these customizations at the show, including a particularly cool one that replicated the dashboard of Honda&#39;s first-ever Grand Prix-winning machine, 1965&#39;s RA272. The Afeela even picked up the raspy sound of its 1.5-liter V12.</p><p>The pre-production car on the Afeela stage had about a dozen such experiences installed, but the plan is for many, many more. Sony Honda Mobility will launch what it&#39;s calling the Afeela Co-Creation Program, a set of software developer tools and interfaces enabling third-party developers to not only create their own customizations, but to sell them.</p><p>Yes, alternate revenue streams are a big part of the equation here, including premium audio and video purchases, but Sony seemingly isn&#39;t factoring that in to help make the Afeela 1 more affordable. Again, you&#39;re looking at $89,900 to start, a price that hasn&#39;t changed from last year.</p><p>In fact, the biggest change to the Afeela 1 since CES 2025&#39;s showing is a delay. The sedan now isn&#39;t hitting the road until the very end of 2026, with first, limited deliveries happening in California. Arizona is next in 2027, but it could be years more before it&#39;s available anywhere else in the world.</p><p>Don&#39;t call it vaporware, though, because it is coming. Trial production work is already happening at Honda&#39;s plant in Ohio. In fact, the Afeela 1 you see here is an early, pre-production machine assembled there.</p><p>But just because it&#39;s going to happen doesn&#39;t mean that it will be a compelling product. An EV that costs $20,000 more than a more-powerful, longer-range Lucid Air Touring is a difficult proposition today, never mind 2027 or later, when the Afeela 1 will finally become readily available.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%287%29.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_CES_Sony_Honda_Mobility_Afeela_1_Update_%287%29.jpg" style="height:2667px;width:4000px;" alt="Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026" data-uuid="cda3daa9-116a-44f1-9076-5363bf286d0f"/><figcaption>Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>With sedans increasingly on the outs in the American market, an SUV shape would make more sense. Sony confirmed that one is coming by rolling out the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Afeela 2026 Prototype</a>, but despite its name, it isn&#39;t coming until 2028 at the earliest.</p><p>As much as I respect Sony&#39;s stubborn commitment to this project, the numbers are just not working out in the Afeela 1&#39;s favor. I asked Sony Honda Mobility America president and CEO Shugo Yamaguchi what would make the car stand out in an EV segment that&#39;s increasingly crowded with quality machines, many available for tens of thousands less.</p><p>&quot;We do have that LiDAR, which is expensive, and introduces more safety. We have better entertainment, amazing displays and 800 TOPS of processing power. So, we believe that through our applications and our development, we are going to more than make our customers happy,&quot; he said.</p><p>Will customers pay more for a luxury and safety experience topped off by an expensive sensor that likely won&#39;t be fully utilized for years to come? After making a similar pitch in its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volvos-ex90-suv-was-mostly-worth-the-wait-153035616.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">2025 EX90</a>, Volvo has decided to delete LiDAR from the 2026 model. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m more bullish here.</p><p>The Afeela 1 was an audacious product when it was announced at CES 2020, but with each subsequent year it feels more and more out of touch. It&#39;ll undoubtedly be the ultimate expression of brand loyalty for the true PlayStation fans out there. But with even established luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz shifting their focus to more affordable EVs like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/mercedes-benz-cla-first-drive-head-of-the-ev-class-140000562.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">the new CLA</a>, a $90,000 sedan with specs that sounded good in 2020 makes it awfully hard to stay excited for this PlayStation on wheels.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/at-ces-2026-sony-honda-mobilitys-latest-afeela-1-still-feels-woefully-out-of-date-163513001.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roblox Corporation, the company behind the popular online game platform <em>Roblox</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2026/Roblox-Requires-Users-Worldwide-to-Age-Check-to-Access-Chat/default.aspx"><ins>announced today</ins></a> that age verification will now be required for any users wishing to use in-game chat in all regions where the feature is available. This comes after mounting pressure to protect underage players and lawsuits from multiple state attorneys general like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html"><ins>Louisiana</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-over-alleged-child-safety-lapses-131500288.html"><ins>Texas</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Starting January 7, players in the US and abroad will need to submit to facial age estimation via a selfie. Users 13 years of age or older may opt for ID-based checks. These features were given a trial <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-begins-asking-tens-of-millions-of-children-to-verify-their-age-with-a-selfie-120000311.html"><ins>rollout</ins></a> late last year in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where Roblox says half of the daily active users have already completed verification. The company says facial estimation is done via its third-party vendor Persona and that images are deleted immediately after processing. Age verification remains optional to play the game itself and is only required to use chat for now.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once a player&#39;s age is verified, they will be placed in one of six age groups, the youngest being under 9, and the oldest being 21+. Players in these groups can only chat with their own group, as well as age groups directly below and above theirs. Roblox <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat"><ins>says</ins></a> players who are 13 or older can still chat more freely with players beyond their immediate age group by using the &quot;Trusted Connections&quot; feature within <em>Roblox</em>. This feature is intended for friends imported via a user&#39;s phone, or contacts added by QR codes shared outside of <em>Roblox</em>. Age verification is still required by both parties to use this feature.</p>
<p>Players under 9 years old will have chat turned off by default unless a parent approves its use after age verification. Roblox says it may ask users to resubmit verification if their behavior suggests they are substantially older or younger than they claimed.</p>
<p>Roblox has faced <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/"><ins>repeated accusations</ins></a> that it was not doing enough to protect younger players. In 2024, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-restricts-dms-for-kids-under-13-and-beefs-up-parental-controls-in-safety-push-120031833.html"><ins>banned players</ins></a> under 13 from accessing certain types of in-game content, as well as restricting their ability to direct message with other players outside of specific games. Last year the company cracked down on user-created content, after a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Files/Article/322/Documents/RobloxLawsuit.pdf"><ins>lawsuit</ins></a> from the state of Louisiana alleged some disturbing in-game &quot;experiences&quot; that minors may have been exposed to.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-now-requires-age-verification-to-use-in-game-chat-163213512.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the original, and<em> </em>best <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-11-total-recall-mind-bending-blu-ray-july-31st.html" data-i13n="slk:Total Recall,;cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Total Recall,</em></a><em> </em>you may remember a scene in which Rekall’s receptionist changes her nail polish by using a digital pen. Now, after only 35 years, a company came to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">CES 2026</a> with a vision for such a gadget that actually works outside of that pricey sci-fi movie. The company is iPolish, and it makes press-on acrylic nails that, when you apply an electric charge, change color almost like magic.</p><p>In order to enjoy kaleidoscopic nails, you’ll need to charge the wand, which then connects to your phone. Once you’ve selected your color of choice, you just put the tip of the nail into the wand, and it’ll pass a short charge into the nail to change it. Sadly, the company wouldn’t shed too much light on the process it uses to run the nails but, from my guess, it’s some sort of electrochemical shenanigans going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;All in all, it took around five seconds to change the color of a single nail, so it’s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg" style="height:1013px;width:1800px;" alt="iPolish" data-uuid="f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a"/><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>iPolish says that each nail can display 400 colors, and can be changed as many times as the user would like. So, if you’re coordinating your nails with your outfits, you’re not bound to a single color palette in the weeks between salon visits. They’re also surprisingly affordable, with the starter set <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ipolish.fashion/collections/starter-kits" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">costing $95</a> which contains two sets of nails, one in Ballerina cut, one in Squoval. The Ballerinas are relatively short, while the Sqovals are longer.&nbsp; It’s worth noting that you can’t shape the nails as you’ll break the hardware, so if you don’t like those shapes, you can’t use ‘em.</p><p>When it comes time to replace your nails when one breaks or you lose it in some nailbed mishap, you’ll be able to pick up spares for $6.50. Given the theoretical cost of getting your nails re-done on a weekly basis, being able to change color on a whim seems like a bargain. Of course, we won’t be able to speak to iPolish’s quality and reliability until they start shipping, which is presently expected to begin in June 2026.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Meta gives examples of a user assigning themself the role of a dad in one chat and a soccer goalkeeper in another. This could actually be pretty useful to people who use WhatsApp group chats to role play as characters, organize fantasy sports leagues and other stuff like that.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform is also rolling out text stickers to group chats. This lets users turn just about any word into a sticker via an integrated search engine. Folks can gather their most-used stickers together for easy access.</p>
<p>Finally, there are event reminders. This is fairly self-explanatory. The tool lets people create early reminders for upcoming events. Meta says that &quot;this helps everyone remember to commute to the party you&#39;re hosting or hop on the call at the right time.&quot;</p>

<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.</p>
<p>The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1;slk:130-inch Micro RGB concept;" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html">130-inch Micro RGB concept</a>, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html">Samsung’s First Look event</a>. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-samsung-oled-tvs">Samsung OLED TVs</h2>
<p>Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.</p>
<p>The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.</p>
<p>Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1;slk:LG&#x002019;s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV;" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html">LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV</a> makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.</p>
<p>Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-lg-micro-rgb-evo-tvs">LG Micro RGB evo TVs</h2>
<p>LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;slk:Micro RGB evo lineup;" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">Micro RGB evo lineup</a>, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.</p>
<p>LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.</p>
<p>This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-lg-oled-tvs-c6-and-c6h">LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)</h2>
<p>OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.</p>
<p>These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-tcl-x11l-sqd-mini-led-tv">TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV</h2>
<p>TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.</p>
<p>The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.</p>
<p>The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.</p>
<p>With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-190929976.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-28-this-phone-powered-vision-test-can-replace-your-doctor.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Vision tests</a> are an important part of life, but they aren’t always the most convenient things to work into your schedule. It’s an issue Eyebot thinks it has solved with its kiosk, which shrinks the time taken from 20 minutes to closer to three minutes. Plus, you don’t need to book an appointment where an optician will lean too close in to your face while trial and error-ing corrective lenses. As mundane as a subject as a visit to the eye doctor is, this device could have some fairly massive ramifications. And, having tested it, I can certainly see the benefits.</p><p>Eyebot CEO Matthias Hofmann said that, despite the popularity of online glasses retailers like Warby Parker, 85 percent of Americans prefer to buy glasses in person. But accessibility is a big issue, especially in areas where there aren’t enough eye doctors to efficiently process tests. Hofmann added that this issue is far worse in rural areas, where people may need to drive for an hour or more to see an eye doctor, and then wait two weeks for their prescription to be filed.&nbsp; It’s these two maladies that Eyebot’s kiosk is meant to address, allowing people to walk up and complete their vision test whenever they want.</p><p>The test itself is very simple, you just walk up to the kiosk and let the big touchscreen walk you through the steps. You’ll answer some basic screening questions — this test is suitable for those aged 18 to 64 — and then complete a fairly perfunctory letter test. Once that’s done, you’ll be asked to stare at a picture of a hot air balloon (but not the picture you’re thinking of).  Once that’s done, you just need to share your email address and then wait for your prescription to be filed.</p><p>But you don’t need to worry that your eye health is being left to some algorithm making its best guess. Eyebot explained that each of its prescriptions are sent to an eye doctor working remotely who can look at the data the kiosk has generated, signing off on the prescription. Thankfully, I was able to compare this prescription with my last eye test (conducted by a professional) from the previous year, and found that Eyebot’s results matched it perfectly. It is worth noting, however, that Eyebot can’t run any medical tests; like the little puff of air blown onto your eyes to measure the pressure your eyes can withstand, which shows your risk of glaucoma. Consequently, while you can get your prescription with this process, you’ll still be advised to take regular visits to see a clinician. &nbsp;</p><p>Eyebot is presently operating in limited numbers in some Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in Pennsylvania, with plans to roll this out across the US in the near future. For the former, you’ll need to pay, while the latter comes as a benefit of your membership. Hofmann said that he envisages a future where there are Eyebot kiosks in shopping malls or at brick and mortar stores for online glasses retailers to grease the wheels of getting that fancy new pair of specs.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/eyebot-promises-an-accurate-vision-test-in-a-couple-of-minutes-160000184.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CES 2026 isn&#39;t the first year we&#39;ve seen a wave of interesting robots or even useful robots crop up in Las Vegas. But it&#39;s the first year I can remember when there have been so many humanoid and humanoid-like robots performing actually useful tasks. Of those, Switchbot&#39;s Onero H1 has been one of the most intriguing robot helpers I&#39;ve seen on the show floor, especially because the company says that it will actually go on sale later this year (though it won&#39;t come cheap).&nbsp;</p><p>Up to now, Chinese company Switchbot has been known for its robot vacuums and smart home devices. Much of that expertise is evident in Onero. The unexpectedly cute robot has a wheeled base that looks similar to the company&#39;s robot vacuums, but is also equipped with a set of articulated arms that can help it perform common household tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>I was able to see some of its abilities at Switchbot&#39;s CES booth, where Onero dutifully picked up individual articles of clothing from a couch, rolled over to a washing machine, opened the door, placed the items inside and closed the door. The robot moved a bit slowly; it took nearly two minutes for it to grab one piece of clothing and deposit it inside the appliance which was only a few feet away.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/N3rG4bQ0" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" data-oembed-type="iframely" data-provider-name="tiktok" data-embed-domain="www.tiktok.com"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;m not sure if its slowness was a quirk of the poor CES Wi-Fi, a demo designed to maximize conference-goers attention or a genuine limitation of the robot. But I&#39;m not sure it matters all that much. The whole appeal of a chore robot is that it can take care of things when you&#39;re not around; if you come home to a load of laundry that&#39;s done, it&#39;s not that concerning if the robot took longer to complete the task than you would have. The laundry is done and you don&#39;t have to do it. That&#39;s the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Under the hood, Onero is powered by RealSense cameras and other sensors that help it learn its surroundings, as well as on-device AI models.</p><p>The demo of course only offered a very limited glimpse of Onero&#39;s potential capabilities. In a promotional video shared by Switchbot, the company suggests the robot can so much, much more: serve food and drinks, put dishes away, wash windows, fold clothes and complete a bunch of other — frankly, impressive — tasks. The Onero in the video also has an articulated hand with five fingers that gives it more dexterity than the claw-hand one I saw at CES. A Switchbot rep told me, though, that it plans to offer both versions when it does go on sale.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqLRDWNzzZ8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Which brings me to the most exciting part about watching Onero: the company is actually planning on selling it this year. A Switchbot rep confirmed to me it will be available to buy sometime in 2026, though it will likely be closer to the end of the year. The company hasn&#39;t settled on a final price, but I was told it will be &quot;less than $10,000.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While we don&#39;t know how much less, it&#39;s safe to say Onero won&#39;t come cheap. It also seems fair to say that this will be a very niche device compared to many of Switchbot&#39;s other products. But, if it can competently handle everything the company claims it can, then there&#39;s probably a lot of people and businesses that would be willing to pay.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html?src=rss]]></description>
