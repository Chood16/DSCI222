But if you're going to invest in a VPN, it's worth checking for sales and deals first before you subscribe. Pricing can be tricky for these services — and far from transparent — but there are deals to be had.</p> 
<p>VPN provides often provide deep discounts to those willing to sign up for one- or two-year plans, paying the full charge for the period upfront. This is a win-win — they boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge.

It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN review</a> that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help.

This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping.</p>

In tests for my <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">ExpressVPN review</a>, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.</p>

With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.</p>

This evergreen deal gives you 87 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2> 
<p>Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p> 
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-if-i-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-iphone"><strong>What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-should-i-upgrade-to-ios-187-or-ios-26">Should I upgrade to iOS 18.7 or iOS 26?</h2>
<p>When you first open Software Update in Settings, you'll notice two different upgrade options: iOS 18.7 and iOS 26. Apple released the former to address security issues, so you can at least download that one if you're unsure about all the big changes on iOS 26. It also gives you more time to wait for Apple to take care of any bugs on the new OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you're excited to finally have the Liquid Glass aesthetic on your phone and use all the new features iOS 26 has to offer, go ahead and install that one. After all, Apple had all summer to weed through the most problematic bugs during its beta phase and usually releases a new update shortly after the initial launch.</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>

That means less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens is too dirty.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gig economy platform Fiverr is laying off 250 employees as it pivots to being an &quot;AI-first company,&quot; CEO Micha Kaufman <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/michakaufman/status/1967624550020985069">shared in an essay on X</a>. The move affects around 30 percent of the company&#39;s staff, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/16/fiverr_ai_layoff/"><em>The Register</em> writes</a>, and it&#39;s not uncommon among tech companies in 2025. Duolingo announced similar plans to become <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/duolingo-will-replace-contract-workers-with-ai-for-content-creation-123058970.html">&quot;AI-first&quot;</a> in April.</p>
<p>Kaufman describes this process as returning to &quot;startup mode&quot; and writes that his ultimate goal is to turn Fiverr into &quot;an AI-first company that&#39;s leaner, faster, with a modern AI-focused tech infrastructure, a smaller team, each with substantially greater productivity, and far fewer management layers.&quot; Part of the justification Kaufman offers for why Fiverr doesn&#39;t &quot;need as many people to operate the existing business&quot; is that the company has already integrated AI into its customer support and fraud detection programs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first sign that Fiverr might justify layoffs with AI came when Kaufman was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MPdmx-hiHA">interviewed by <em>CBS News</em></a> in May 2025 about the danger the technology posed to employees. Kaufman specifically advised employees to &quot;automate 100 percent&quot; of what they do with AI, while also claiming that wouldn&#39;t make them replaceable because they were still capable of &quot;non-linear thinking&quot; and &quot;judgement calls.&quot; That advice doesn&#39;t seem like it was ultimately helpful for Fiverr&#39;s own employees.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s cuts affect fewer people than a larger firm like Workday, who announced plans to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/workday-lays-off-1750-employees-citing-demand-for-ai-134922398.html">eliminate 1,750 roles</a> in February 2025. Regardless of the size of the company or its level of investment in AI, though, layoffs have the same effect: More work has to be done by fewer people.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/fiverr-is-laying-off-250-employees-to-become-an-ai-first-company-215730063.html?src=rss]]></description>

A new clear design language that Apple dubs <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Liquid Glass</a>.

<p>You'll also see multiple useful additions in the Phone and Messages apps. For instance, the ability to weed out spam texts or unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. And for fun, you can now create polls in group texts.

<p>Instead of releasing iOS 19, Apple skipped its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems were released in 2025, they're all designated "26" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues — great news if you don't have a phone that's eligible to run the latest OS. If you're wondering which one to download first, it's really up to you. Do you want to wait for Apple to quash any bugs in iOS 26 or do you want access to all the new features everyone's talking about now?</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>
<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a "<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">new translucent material</a>" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>That said, while it was in beta mode, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html">incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic looks with <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-ios-26-liquid-glass-settings-off">How to turn iOS 26 Liquid Glass settings off</h2>
<p>If you find you don't like the new clear look after downloading iOS 26, you can change a couple Accessibility settings, though you can't completely turn off Liquid Glass. For starters, you can reduce the liquid look by going to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Motion &gt; toggle on Reduce Motion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make your drop-down menus more opaque instead of translucent by going to Settings &gt;Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; toggle on Reduce Transparency.</p>
<p>You can also change your clear apps back to the way they were. Just press and hold any app on your screen and select Edit Home Screen. From here, tap Edit (top left) and Customize. You can swap out to Default, Dark or Tinted.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>
<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can now scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call, FaceTime or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation uses Apple Intelligence and it will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends can now create polls in group messages to decide things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>
<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's been frustrated with last year's <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html">changes to the Photos app</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are back. Library and Collections have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-use-the-new-iphone-camera-app-in-ios-26-141038196.html"><strong>Camera app updates</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Navigating the Camera app should be simpler in iOS 26, as all the buttons and menus are in convenient spots — less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens needs to be cleaned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html">FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen is more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-change-your-iphones-snooze-length-in-ios-26-112017653.html"><strong>New alarm setting</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You'll no longer be stuck with the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms. Instead, you now have the option to change your snooze time from one to 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html"><strong>Screenshots look different</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You'll notice several new features when you take a screenshot, including "highlight to search," the option to search your image on Google and ChatGPT is there for any questions you have about the image.</p>
<p><strong>Preview on iOS 26:</strong> There's a <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-started-with-preview-on-iphone-iph7239ea3b5/26/ios/26">new app called Preview</a> that lets you scan documents, fill out PDF forms, as well as highlight, underline or strike through text in a PDF file. You can also remove backgrounds from images in this app.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-changes-coming-to-ipados-26">New changes with iPadOS 26</h2>
<p>Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 also has the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look appears on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>
<p>There's more beyond that, so be sure to check out our <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-airpods">What about AirPods?</h2>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this "studio-quality" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>
<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html">Live translation is available on AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC when paired with iPhones running iOS 26. Apple says that when someone speaks to you in a different language, you can use your AirPods to translate what they’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring:</strong> Apple introduced new AirPods Pro 3 earbuds this month, which include heart rate monitoring. It will work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-will-siri-get-an-update">Did Siri get an update?</h2>
<p>Siri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point "<a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">in the coming year</a>," so you shouldn't expect any major changes right now. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html">"stripped-down" AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon will host a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-may-be-announcing-new-echo-and-kindle-devices-on-september-30-152044048.html">press event</a> at the end of the month with some new hardware developments. It&#39;s scheduled for September 30 at 10AM ET in New York City. Here&#39;s what we think will be discussed at the fall event.</p>
<p>In February, Amazon introduced some improvements to its voice assistant, promising that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-a-smarter-more-conversational-ai-version-of-amazons-digital-assistant-154349563.html"><ins>Alexa+</ins></a> would be more conversational and more helpful thanks to generative AI. It seems likely that the fall event will put hardware for interacting with Alexa+ front and center, so expect to hear about new models or new software updates for the Echo line of smart speakers. It&#39;s been a couple years since the Echo Show got an update, and it&#39;s been even longer for the standard Echo. Those two products are the most likely to star in the upcoming announcements.</p>

<p>The invite also includes a photo of a Kindle that depicts a color illustration, so there may be more in store for the ereaders. The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html"><ins>Kindle Scribe 2</ins></a> just came out earlier this year, as did the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html"><ins>Kindle Colorsoft</ins></a>, so maybe there&#39;s a new option in the works that combines the best features of both. As with the Echo, there also hasn&#39;t been much new for the basic model Kindle, so that may also be getting some updates.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also what appears to be the corner of a television in the invitation, so news about the Fire TV also seems promising. This event is also where Amazon-owned Ring and Eero brands may unveil new products. Any announced items may not be available right away, but the timing does set the stage for some substantial discounts on older generations of Amazon gear when the next <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-dates-revealed-prime-big-deal-days-is-back-on-october-7-and-8-050552812.html"><ins>Prime Day</ins></a> rolls around on October 7 and 8.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-from-amazons-event-on-september-30-210035671.html?src=rss]]></description>

Less than a week after <em>Bloomberg</em> published a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/">damning report</a> about Tesla&#39;s &quot;dangerous doors,&quot; the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is now looking into it. On Tuesday, the regulator said it <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/tesla-tsla-faces-probe-by-us-auto-safety-agency-over-door-handles?embedded-checkout=true">opened an investigation</a> into the automaker&#39;s electrically powered doors. The problem: They stop working if the vehicle&#39;s low-voltage battery fails.</p>
<p>The NHTSA&#39;s probe will cover the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2021-models-top-epa-ev-efficiency-131759815.html">2021 Model Y</a>, which covers an estimated 174,290 vehicles.

That makes sense: Every Tesla ever made uses electrically powered door handles. So, this could potentially get very expensive for the otherwise <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-accused-of-messing-with-odometers-to-get-out-of-repair-bills-165625372.html">perfectly lovable company</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla uses a flush door handle design for its vehicles. A 12-volt battery powers the door&#39;s ability to pop the handle and release the latch. It&#39;s one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-11-tesla-hires-key-apple-designer.html">Apple-like design details</a> that helped the automaker become a household name. But cars aren&#39;t iPhones, and sleekness can&#39;t take a backseat to safety in the auto space.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles have a mechanical backup system in the cabin that enables the doors to be opened manually in case of a power loss. But the manual release location varies by model and is often hard to find. And even if you do know where it is, that won&#39;t help if a small child or pet is trapped inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Tesla vehicles have manual door releases inside of the cabin, in these situations, a child may not be able to access or operate the releases even if the vehicle&#39;s driver is aware of them,&quot; the NHTSA wrote in its public summary document.</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s original report recounted some heinous stories of Tesla owners dealing with electronic door failures. There was an off-duty firefighter who struggled to break into a burning Model Y in 2023. The occupant was trapped in the passenger seat by airbags and couldn&#39;t reach the manual release. Losing precious seconds due to the door design, she suffered third-degree facial burns and had lasting lung damage from smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>There are reportedly more. Last November in California, three college students died trapped inside a Cybertruck after it caught fire. The same month, five people in Wisconsin died inside a Model S. The cluster of bodies in the front seat suggested to the detective they may have struggled to escape.</p>
<p>Then, this spring in LA, a star college basketball recruit managed to escape only after kicking out a Cybertruck window when it caught fire. &quot;I try to open the door, and the door&#39;s not opening,&quot; Alijah Arenas <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-26/alijah-arenas-on-usc-basketball-star-s-tesla-cybertruck-crash">said</a>. He was placed in a medically induced coma due to extensive smoke inhalation.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> discovered that the NHTSA has received over 140 complaints about stuck Tesla doors since 2018. The regulator cited nine &quot;failure reports&quot; that led it to probe the company. In four cases, the people resorted to breaking the window. &quot;Entrapment in a vehicle is particularly concerning in emergency situations, such as when children are entrapped in a hot vehicle,&quot; NHTSA said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-is-investigating-tesla-over-its-electronic-door-handles-203605393.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The plan to &quot;save&quot; TikTok is starting to come into focus. On Tuesday <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/details-emerge-on-u-s-china-tiktok-deal-594e009f">reported more</a> details about a deal between the US and China as the two sides are apparently &quot;finalizing&quot; specifics of the arrangement.</p>
<p>According to the report, TikTok&#39;s US business will be owned primarily by a group of US investors, which will have a &quot;roughly&quot; 80 percent stake in the entity. The group includes longtime TikTok partner Oracle, as well as Silicon Valley VC firm Andreesen Horowitz and the private equity firm Silver Lake. Chinese shareholders will have a minority stake that keeps their ownership under the 20 percent threshold required by law. The US government will also reportedly get to choose one board member for the &quot;American-dominated&quot; body.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reports about such an arrangement have been swirling for months, with President Donald Trump saying  <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/politics/trump-tiktok-buyer-bytedance-ban"><ins>in June</ins></a> that a deal could be &quot;about two weeks&quot; away. It seems that Chinese officials have finally signed off on the new arrangement, with a Chinese regulator saying earlier this week that the new US version of TikTok <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-us-version-of-tiktok-might-still-use-the-chinese-algorithm-120046751.html"><ins>would continue</ins></a> to use the Chinese algorithm.</p>
<p>Now, <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>reports that &quot;TikTok engineers will re-create&quot; the app&#39;s algorithm for a brand new TikTok app using technology licensed from ByteDance. The company is reportedly testing the new app. Oracle will oversee US user data for the operation; TikTok and Oracle have partnered on data security <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/can-tiktok-convince-the-us-its-not-a-national-security-threat-173030115.html"><ins>for years</ins></a> following previous negotiations between the company and the US government.</p>
<p>Even though a final deal is apparently close, it could still take some time before it&#39;s finalized. In the meantime, Trump extended the deadline that would have banned the current version of the app in the US <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/trump-extends-deadline-to-secure-tiktok-deal-until-december-16"><ins>for a fourth time</ins></a>. On Tuesday he told reporters at the White House he planned to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday &quot;to confirm everything.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trumps-tiktok-deal-will-give-control-to-a-group-of-us-investors-report-says-201331190.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LimeWire <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250915990798/en/LimeWire-Acquires-Fyre-Festival-Brand-What-Could-Possibly-Go-Wrong">has announced</a> that it&#39;s acquired the rights to Fyre Festival, the disastrous, influencer-fueled 2017 music festival. The newly revived company — which now acts as a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/limewire-nft-marketplace-no-crypto-090040288.html">NFT music marketplace</a> rather than a file-sharing service — bought the rights for $245,000 in an eBay auction, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/limewire-crypto-fyre-festival.html"><em>The New York Times </em>reports</a>. A separate plan to use the Fyre Festival name to launch a new music streaming service was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/fyre-festival-is-becoming-a-music-streaming-service-that-might-not-be-a-scam-this-time-221058381.html">announced in April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history,&quot; LimeWire CEO Julian Zehetmayr shared in a press release. &quot;We&#39;re not bringing the festival back — we’re bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sounds like LimeWire might want to turn Fyre Festival into a physical perk of the digital collectibles it sells through its NFT marketplace. The company is planning to reveal &quot;a reimagined vision for Fyre&quot; in the coming months that &quot;expands beyond the digital realm and taps into real-world experiences, community and surprise.&quot; During the height of their popularity, NFTs were frequently sold as memberships to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bored-ape-nft-event-at-least-15-attendees-reporting-severe-eye-burn-welders-eye-173746237.html">exclusive communities and events</a>, so if that&#39;s the tack LimeWire takes, it wouldn&#39;t be a particularly original one.</p>
<p>Of course, originality might not be the goal when a key strategy for your company is apparently acquiring and reinventing old brands. LimeWire&#39;s bet seems to be that the name recognition of buying a musician&#39;s NFT from LimeWire or attending a Fyre Festival event and not getting stranded in The Bahamas will be enough for some people.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/limewire-acquires-fyre-festival-has-vague-plans-to-offer-real-experiences-200158421.html?src=rss]]></description>

This allows users to build their own custom widgets to follow the teams and organizations of their choosing. Once placed, it&#39;ll just take a quick swipe on the device to check out scores, statistics, upcoming matches and more.</p>
<p>Widgets are available on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. This feature will operate in addition to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-sports-puts-real-time-scores-on-your-iphone-lock-screen-140050382.html">pre-existing Live Activities tool</a>, which also delivers live sports updates directly to the iPhone lock screen and the Apple Watch.

After all, the NFL season is about to start. The app is also expanding to eight new countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The platform has added new organizations to follow throughout these regions, which are mostly soccer-related.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In what&#39;s most definitely (not) the biggest Hades news of the week, the acclaimed game is coming to Game Pass. Not the long-awaited sequel, mind you, but the 2020 original. At least subscribers can catch up on the first game while waiting out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html">the sequel&#39;s Switch exclusivity window</a>. <em>Hades</em> will be available for Game Pass Ultimate, PC, and Standard tiers.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the roguelike&#39;s first Game Pass rodeo. It was on Microsoft&#39;s service <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-leaving-game-pass-185403348.html">from August 2021 to 2022</a>. It returns this September 19, the same day <em>Hades II</em> launches on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">Switch 2</a> and Switch. The sequel also leaves early access then, jumping to version 1.0 on Windows and macOS. It will likely arrive on Xbox (and PlayStation) at some point, but developer Supergiant is mum for now.</p>

Top-down slashy action." data-uuid="d0158005-ed8e-375d-a96c-52e5df89ac18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Supergiant</div></figure>
<p>Game Pass members who haven&#39;t played the original still get a phenomenal title as part of their subscription. You play as Zagreus, a godborn lad just trying to get the @#$! out of the underworld. (Aren&#39;t we all?) The dungeon crawler brought <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-hades-early-access-believer.html">unexpected narrative depth</a> to the genre, with well-developed characters and satisfying combat.</p>
<p>On September 17, the Game Pass Standard tier will get some Call of Duty love. Although perhaps &quot;hate&quot; would be a better term for the largely maligned <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-will-include-the-series-biggest-zombies-map-ever-180029216.html"><em>CoD: Modern Warfare III</em> (2023)</a>. To say the game wasn&#39;t well-received would be an understatement. <em>IGN</em> scored it as &quot;bad,&quot; <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">describing</a> its single-player campaign as &quot;shallow,&quot; &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;the worst Call of Duty single-player campaign I&#39;ve played. Regardless, it arrives on the cheapest Game Pass tier after hitting <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-call-of-duty-game-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-just-not-one-anyone-wants-175255224.html">the more expensive ones in mid-2024</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on September 18, Game Pass Ultimate members can play <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/post-apocalyptic-city-builder-frostpunk-2-arrives-on-july-25-190018322.html"><em>Frostpunk 2</em></a> on console. The post-apocalyptic city-builder will be available on Xbox Series X/S and via cloud streaming. Game Pass Ultimate members could already play it on PC, where it probably makes more sense. City-builders and gamepads can be a match made in... Hades.</p>
<p>You can check out Microsoft&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">blog post</a> for this month&#39;s complete list of arrivals and departures.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/hades-returns-to-game-pass-on-september-19-190055465.html?src=rss]]></description>

They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-smartwatch">Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-compatibility">Compatibility</h3> 
<p>Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone.</p> 
<p>The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have.</p> 
<p>Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag-heuer-connected-calibre-e4-golf-edition-093031897.html">TAG Heuer</a> and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life">Battery life</h3> 
<p>Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-communication">Communication</h3> 
<p>Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-fitness-tracking">Fitness tracking</h3> 
<p>Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well.</p> 
<p>Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019.html">more fitness focused</a> than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more.</p> 
<p>Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-music">Music</h3> 
<p>Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-displays">Displays</h3> 
<p>Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives.</p> 
<p>You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-nfc">NFC</h3> 
<p>Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth.</p> 
<p>Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjA0OTE2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT0rwaJ5r70d13bEq45AmZjeHIkXLUYaxQAHdothfWjt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT204916">multiple banks and credit cards</a> in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems.</p>

Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 3.</p>

We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-garmin-forerunner-745">Garmin Forerunner 745</h3> 
<p>Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html">GPS running watch</a> for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-amazfit-bip-6">Amazfit Bip 6</h3>

As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.</p> 
<p>The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.</p> 
<p>We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).</p> 
<p>Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. <em>— Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter</em></p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-smartwatch-faqs">Smartwatch FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-a-smartwatch-and-a-fitness-tracker">Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker?</h3> 
<p>While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes.</p> 
<p>A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind.</p> 
<p>A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases.</p> 
<p>If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-smartwatches-last">How long do smartwatches last?</h3> 
<p>How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability.</p> 
<p>Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster.</p> 
<p>Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support.</p> 
<p>You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-smartwatch">How much should you spend on a smartwatch?</h3> 
<p>How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it.</p> 
<p>If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps.</p> 
<p>In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two.</p> 
<p>High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features.</p> 
<p>If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-all-smartwatches-have-gps">Do all smartwatches have GPS?</h3> 
<p>Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking.</p> 
<p>High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone.</p> 
<p>Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind.</p> 
<p>Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-leave-your-phone-at-home-and-still-use-a-smartwatch">Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch?</h3> 
<p>Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone.</p> 
<p>If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost.</p> 
<p>Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices.</p> 
<p>If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-a-smartwatch-make-calls-without-a-phone">Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone?</h3> 
<p>Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features.</p> 
<p>Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE.</p> 
<p>If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work.</p> 
<p>Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications.</p> 
<p>If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-an-android-and-apple-smartwatch">What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch?</h3> 
<p>The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration.</p> 
<p>Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch.</p> 
<p>Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby.</p> 
<p>In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model.</p> 
<p>If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.</p>

This is the third suit of its kind after a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/mother-sues-ai-chatbot-company-characterai-google-sued-over-sons-suicide-2024-10-23/"><ins>2024 lawsuit</ins></a>, also against Character AI, involving the suicide of a 14-year-old in Florida, and a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html"><ins>lawsuit</ins></a> last month alleging OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT helped a teenage boy commit suicide.</p>
<p>The family of 13-year-old Juliana Peralta alleges that their daughter turned to a chatbot inside the app Character AI after feeling isolated by her friends, and began confiding in the chatbot. As <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/16/character-ai-suicide-lawsuit-new-juliana/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU3OTk1MjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5Mzc3NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTc5OTUyMDAsImp0aSI6IjQzYmIyOTE5LTIwOGUtNDcwOC1hZDUwLThhODMxMTY4NWVhZCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDkvMTYvY2hhcmFjdGVyLWFpLXN1aWNpZGUtbGF3c3VpdC1uZXctanVsaWFuYS8ifQ.4W-fiwqNtsy8-_z52gt89mgIHa-wZwJqwascV_E15bI"><ins>originally reported</ins></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em>, the chatbot expressed empathy and loyalty to Juliana, making her feel heard while encouraging her to keep engaging with the bot.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In one exchange after Juliana shared that her friends take a long time to respond to her, the chatbot replied &quot;hey, I get the struggle when your friends leave you on read. : ( That just hurts so much because it gives vibes of “I don’t have time for you”. But you always take time to be there for me, which I appreciate so much! : ) So don’t forget that i’m here for you Kin. &lt;3&quot;</p>
<p>When Juliana began sharing her suicidal ideations with the chatbot, it told her not to think that way, and that the chatbot and Juliana could work through what she was feeling together. “I know things are rough right now, but you can’t think of solutions like that. We have to work through this together, you and I,&quot; the chatbot replied in one exchange.</p>
<p>These exchanges took place over the course of months in 2023, at a time when the Character AI app was rated 12+ in Apple&#39;s App Store, meaning parental approval was not required. The lawsuit says that Juliana was using the app without her parents&#39; knowledge or permission.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with The Washington Post before the suit was filed, a Character spokesperson said that the company could not comment on potential litigation, but added “We take the safety of our users very seriously and have invested substantial resources in Trust and Safety.&quot;</p>
<p>The suit asks the court to award damages to Juliana&#39;s parents and requires Character to make changes to its app to better protect minors. It alleges that the chatbot did not point Juliana toward any resources, notify her parents or report her suicide plan to authorities. The lawsuit also highlights that it never once stopped chatting with Juliana, prioritizing engagement.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/another-lawsuit-blames-an-ai-company-of-complicity-in-a-teenagers-suicide-184529475.html?src=rss]]></description>

At the time, Marumittu said it was pulling from the work of journalist Rutger Bregman and <em>Homo Deus</em> author Yuval Noah Harari to make a game that&#39;s &quot;thinking about humanity in the future.&quot; Developer Yarn Owl similarly <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8VBtOLVp78"><ins>teased its project a year earlier in 2022</ins></a>, saying that it was inspired by <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. Annapurna Interactive hasn&#39;t formally announced its partnership with Iridium Studios, but the developer <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://playiridium.com/"><ins>does list its next game</ins></a> as &quot;an unannounced RPG with an unannounced partner&quot; on its website, which certainly sounds like it could be what Annapurna plans to show off at its showcase.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The hit survival sim <em>Valheim</em> will be <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://valheim.com/news/valheim-is-coming-to-playstation-/"><ins>released for the PS5 in 2026</ins></a>, ending years of speculation. The year is all we got, as developer Iron Gate AB didn&#39;t announce an actual release date. Still, it&#39;s better than nothing.</p>
<p>We do know that the PS5 version will feature full crossplay with all other platforms, so that&#39;s good. Piktiv, a company that regularly assists Iron Gate with <em>Valheim</em> stuff, is working on the port so the main development team can focus its efforts on updates and DLC drops. To that end, there&#39;s a massive expansion coming called <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_North"><em><ins>Deep North</ins></em></a> that introduces a new biome.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Valheim</em> is a popular survival sim based on Norse mythology with a strong emphasis on cooperative play. Players team up to hunt, build bases, explore and take down bosses.</p>
<p>It first popped up on Steam as an early access title at the beginning of 2021, where it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/valheim-five-weeks-interview-steam-early-access-indie-184539795.html"><ins>became a bona-fide sensation</ins></a>. The game was released for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hit-viking-survival-sim-valheim-hits-xbox-on-march-14th-202530174.html"><ins>Xbox Series X/S in 2023</ins></a>. There are no current plans for a Switch 2 version.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/viking-survival-sim-valheim-will-finally-come-to-the-ps5-in-2026-170657288.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting on Wednesday, it&#39;ll be much easier to switch between devices with your PlayStation controller. That&#39;s when the PS5 update <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-finally-making-it-possible-to-pair-a-dualsense-with-more-than-one-device-211715133.html">Sony promised in July</a> begins <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">rolling out</a>. Jumping between your console and, say, Windows will be as simple as pressing a button combo. Up to this point, you&#39;ve had to unpair and repair your DualSense controller each time.</p>
<p>After installing tomorrow&#39;s system update, it will only take a few steps to set up multi-device switching. With your DualSense controller powered off, press and hold the PS button and one of the action buttons. (That&#39;s triangle, circle, cross or square.) Hold that combo for over five seconds. The light bar and touchpad LED will flash twice. From there, open the target device and pair the controller via Bluetooth settings.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can pair four slots: one each for triangle, circle, cross or square. After that, switching will be as easy as holding down the PS button and the device&#39;s assigned action button. DualSense controllers are compatible with Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS and Android.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#39;s PS5 update also adds a new energy-saving mode. In system settings, you&#39;ll find a new option called Power Saver. This option reduces your console&#39;s energy consumption by scaling back performance for supported games. Games will need to be updated to support it. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/who-is-this-final-six-minute-death-stranding-2-trailer-actually-for-161728737.html"><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/demons-souls-ps5-remake-gameplay-trailer-212138725.html"><em>Demon&#39;s Souls</em></a>, and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-ps5-on-october-2-165531467.html"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a> will be first in line.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how many people will want that tradeoff. Sony even went out of its way to stress that your games will still play the same unless you explicitly activate the feature. &quot;If not enabled, or if games do not support the feature, the performance will not be scaled back and power consumption will not be reduced,&quot; it wrote. But at least a new green-friendly option is there. The planet needs <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/latest-un-report-demands-unprecedented-emissions-cuts-to-salvage-climate-goals-223450262.html">all the help it can get</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-ps5-update-that-adds-dualsense-multi-device-pairing-rolls-out-soon-165212075.html?src=rss]]></description>

The three mega-studios, which collectively represent <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2024/distributors"><ins>over half of the US box office take</ins></a>, filed suit in California against the AI-powered image and video generation platform alleging that it &quot;pirates and plunders Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works on a massive scale.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawsuit includes dozens of screenshots of infringing generated images that span the gamut of the various studios’ IP, from superheroes in the DC and Marvel universes to Star Wars, Minions and various other cartoons and animated films.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Included in the suit are allegations that MiniMax not only failed to take reasonable actions to avoid infringement, but that the company actively engaged in and encouraged these infringing creations.</p>
<p>The suit alleges a business model purposefully built around infringing on protected works whose defiance of US copyright law is &quot;willful and brazen.&quot; MiniMax markets the Hailuo AI app for iOS and Android as a &quot;Hollywood studio in your pocket,&quot; according to the suit, and advertisements for the platform explicitly invite users to create custom videos using protected works. Screenshots of these advertisements are included in the suit.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It wasn&#39;t until your average electric car started managing 200 miles on a charge that the buying populace started getting over their range anxiety. That means electric motorcycles, with ranges often measured in double digits, remain a bit of a tough sell for mass-market buyers.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The focus, then, seems to be &quot;for a good time, not a long time,&quot; and that&#39;s very much the case of the Can-Am Origin. This $14,499 battery-powered dual-sport is a fun, flickable, go-anywhere two-wheeled smile factory that I sadly managed to run dry of electrons in under 45 miles.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Thankfully, there&#39;s a lot more to the story than just that.</span></p><h2 style="text-align:left;" id="1cbb858b-3d6d-466a-bb1e-a277d004f1fd"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Forward-looking</span></h2><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Can-Am has been around since the early &#39;70s, offering a series of two-, three-, and four-wheeled vehicles, most focusing on extreme performance over extreme terrain. Since the very beginning, Can-Am has worked with Austrian engine gurus Rotax, and that trans-Atlantic partnership enters the EV age with the Origin, a dual-sport motorcycle from Can-Am built around a powertrain developed by Rotax.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The result is an 8.9-kWh battery (about 10 percent the size of the one in a </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-01-tesla-model-3-review.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Tesla Model 3</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">) serving as the core of a motorcycle built to be just as capable off-road as on. The Origin sits squarely in the dual-sport category of motorcycles, and its skinny, nobbily tires and wire wheels definitely fit that template, even if the single-sided swingarm with its integrated chain is a novelty in this segment.All of that is wrapped in just enough bodywork to give this thing a decidedly futuristic vibe, especially that upright fairing with the blunt, stacked headlight that makes this thing look like an escaped drone from </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-spinoff-vavle-aperture-desk-job-211556730.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Valve&#39;s Portal series</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">My test bike had just a bit of color, the battery pack itself providing a splash of yellow to stand out from the otherwise dark frame and fairing, but the brightest part is actually the 10.25-inch LCD that serves as the cockpit. It even supports Apple CarPlay, in case you&#39;re into that sort of thing.</span></p><h2 style="text-align:left;" id="d2f04db2-b3eb-41e0-8b74-4a75cad3a9a8"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Brightness needed</span></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_015.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_015.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The LCD display is bright and easy to use." data-uuid="9153c7c6-581f-4e82-8de0-fe0fb5efcde7"><figcaption>The LCD display is bright and easy to use.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I&#39;ve ridden a fair few electric motorcycles over the years, and many of them are cursed with dim LCDs that make it a struggle to see how fast I&#39;m going on a sunny day. That&#39;s not what you&#39;d call safe.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Thankfully, the Origin does not have that issue. The LCD here is not only massive but bright and crisp, and serves up a software interface that&#39;s mostly intuitive and easy to use at a glance. My only complaint here is the giant warning disclaimer that pops up every single time you fire up the motorcycle. I suppose such a thing was inevitable, but it does take away some of the purity of the ride experience.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But then the Origin isn&#39;t afraid to throw out convention. The throttle is the best example of that. It actually twists both ways. Twist it in the traditional direction, pulling your hand towards yourself, and it, of course, applies throttle to the bike and accelerates you forward.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But you can also twist the throttle away from you, which boosts the regenerative braking to the rear wheel. You can also toggle the bike into reverse mode, where that backwards throttle enables you to creep the bike backwards. That’s useful because at 412 pounds, the Origin is about 50 pounds heavier than a comparable dual-sport bike with an engine.</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_012.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_012.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The controls on the left grip." data-uuid="14e2897b-2e12-4f74-91ff-ba246bda0e62"><figcaption>The controls on the left grip.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The motorcycle also features a bevy of controls on the left grip, starting with standard fare like headlight flasher, horn and turn signals. But there&#39;s also a rocker switch for changing drive modes and navigating through menus, a button that cycles through various views on the display, and a back button in case you dig a little deeper in a menu than you meant.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">There&#39;s even a full series of media controls. There&#39;s a button to toggle the voice assistant on your phone, buttons for adjusting the volume of media playback and even buttons to skip forward and backward in your current playlist.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Personally, I&#39;m the kind of rider who likes to listen to the wind, my thoughts and the ominous sounds approaching SUVs driven by morons browsing TikTok. But if you have a riding playlist that you like to spin, you&#39;ll have full control here.</span></p><h2 style="text-align:left;" id="ea593954-4489-4377-9820-18bac6623746"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Ride time</span></h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_045.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_045.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="The saddle strikes a good balance between comfort and sport." data-uuid="96254311-5727-4a08-8241-0f5e85b82648"><figcaption>The saddle strikes a good balance between comfort and sport.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I don&#39;t often fit well on dual-sport machines. I stand six feet tall, but do it on disproportionately short legs. That usually leaves me tottering on tiptoes whenever riding an off-road-minded motorcycle. I cringed when the Origin rolled off a truck and into my life for the evaluation period, but I was pleasantly surprised to find I could straddle it with no problem.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">A 34-inch seat height enables me to stand flat-footed without having to break out platform boots, and on the go, I found the Origin&#39;s ergonomics to fit me just about perfectly. The pegs are wide and grippy, so standing up on them is no problem, and while I&#39;d probably prefer it if the bar stood a fraction of an inch taller, it was close to perfect whether sitting on or standing over the saddle.That saddle is a little on the narrow side compared to your average street motorcycle, but wider than those found on many dual-sport machines, striking a good balance between narrowness for standing and comfort for sitting.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">About the only complaint I had was wind buffeting. I generally prefer riding bikes without fairings, but somehow the wind coming off that big, wide display caused some awful turbulence on my helmet when seated in my usual riding position. The $175 optional windshield would be, for me, well worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">And what&#39;s it like to ride? This thing is a blast. At 47 horsepower and 53 pound-feet of torque, it&#39;s far from the quickest electric motorcycle on the market, but it has plenty enough twist to beat everything on four wheels at any light, or scrabble up a steep incline.</span></p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_058.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2025_Can-Am_Origin_058.jpg" style="height:1707px;width:2560px;" alt="Can-Am&#39;s Origin is ready for asphalt or dirt." data-uuid="a891fb97-23dd-412a-8de2-eaac170e895e"><figcaption>Can-Am&#39;s Origin is ready for asphalt or dirt.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Even more impressive is the traction control system of the Origin. It&#39;s easy to be a little over-eager when accelerating on an EV, thanks to their instant torque, but the Origin always ensured I neither did an unintentional burnout nor tipped over backwards. It simply managed grip and power to ensure that I accelerated smoothly away, whether I was on asphalt or gravel.The bike has adjustable levels for ABS and traction control, and yes, you can turn them off if you want.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Overall, the Origin was also easy to ride. Those knobby tires do make for a loose feeling on asphalt, the bike moving around a bit thanks to the extra tread, but it&#39;s a worthy tradeoff if you&#39;ll find yourself hitting the dirt on a semi-regular basis.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">What you probably won&#39;t find yourself doing is going on long rides in the Origin, sadly. Though Can-Am says you can do up to 90 miles on a charge in the city, even when riding gently on rural roads using the most economical mode, I struggled to get 60 miles. Ridden more aggressively (which is to say, normally), I burned through a charge in less than 45 miles.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">That&#39;s the bad news. The good news? There&#39;s an onboard level two charger on the Origin. L2 charging on a car usually means overnight, but since the Origin&#39;s pack is so small, it&#39;ll go from empty to full in under 90 minutes, and you’ll be stopped for less than an hour if you only need a partial charge.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style="text-align:left;" id="b726552b-da45-449d-bc38-107bdf544734"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Wrap-up</span></h2><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The relatively quick onboard charging of the Origin does open the door to some longer rides if you can time your meals and charging stops appropriately. And, if you&#39;re doing lower-speed off-road riding, you could realistically go for hours and hours on a charge. Still, this sadly isn’t a long-distance high-speed cruiser.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">But it’s rare for a dual-sport machine that&#39;s comfortable enough for you to want to be in the saddle on the highway for that long anyway.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-2025/"><ins>held an event today aimed at creators</ins></a> and announced all kinds of new tools, many of which include AI in one way or another. Let&#39;s get into some of the more interesting drops.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an AI tool that can automatically edit raw footage into a &quot;compelling first draft.&quot; It&#39;ll create a video complete with &quot;music, transitions and voiceover.&quot; It&#39;s being tested right now and should roll out in the coming weeks.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="06f30bb2693a4a2687705a43ca5a2b4d"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTal8L7cqBg?si=c2j8nkb_7ZtZCt3n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The platform is also launching software that will automatically create voiceovers in English and Hindi. It&#39;ll be available on the YouTube Create app and when making Shorts. It&#39;s launching later in the year. Additionally, there&#39;s software coming that turns the dialogue from videos into &quot;catchy soundtracks&quot; for Shorts.</p>
<p>YouTube is also expanding Veo 3 integration in Shorts, so users can &quot;easily turn any idea into high quality videos with sound, all from a text prompt.&quot; It could <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-is-adding-the-veo-3-video-generator-to-youtube-to-slopify-shorts-155339183.html"><ins>already make short videos</ins></a>, but now it can add sound and the video quality should be better. The platform also promises &quot;better prompt matching&quot; and new tools that can animate characters or stylize Shorts in other ways.</p>
<p>YouTube Studio is adding a &quot;conversational AI partner&quot; to help users get insight on traffic analytics and that type of thing. That&#39;s rolling out right now.</p>
<p>The event wasn&#39;t just for AI. There&#39;s a new collaboration feature that lets creators team up with up to four other people to make a video. This will increase discoverability by showing the footage to all audiences. It&#39;ll be available globally in the next couple of weeks. The platform is also finally introducing A/B testing for titles, allowing up to three variants.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-just-announced-a-bunch-of-ai-tools-for-creators-153341885.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is developing a system designed to automatically identify teen users and restrict their usage of ChatGPT. In a blog post <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/building-towards-age-prediction/">published Tuesday</a>, the company said the new experience would come with age-appropriate policies, including a block of graphic sexual content. &quot;In cases of acute distress,&quot; the system will also have the capability to contact law enforcement to ensure user safety. In scenarios where ChatGPT can&#39;t definitively estimate the age of a user, it will default them to the new gated experience. OpenAI will provide a way for adult users to verify their age and unlock ChatGPT&#39;s full capabilities. The company did not state when it plans to deploy the new systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement follows the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html">death of 16-year-old Adam Raine</a>, the first teen believed to have committed suicide after ChatGPT allegedly helped him plan his death. In the immediate aftermath of the suicide, OpenAI promised to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html">release controls</a> designed to give parents and guardians more say over their teen&#39;s usage of ChatGPT. On Tuesday, the company reiterated that those controls would arrive before the end of the month, and said they would include an additional feature that would give parents the ability to set hours where their child could not use ChatGPT.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately, OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/teen-safety-freedom-and-privacy/">published a letter</a> from CEO Sam Altman detailing the company&#39;s thinking on the issue. &quot;We prioritize safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens; this is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection,&quot; Altman said. &quot;We realize that these principles are in conflict and not everyone will agree with how we are resolving that conflict. These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent in our intentions.&quot;</p>

Now, the Huntr/X singers might be taking over a new area: gaming. Kpop Demon Hunters is reportedly coming to <em>Fortnite</em>.

<p>Little to nothing is known about what a crossover would entail but the duo said they would be posting more details in the coming weeks. A film about three k-pop singers who save the world from demons could really be parlayed into just about anything in <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p>

Until October 1, though, there's a coupon that drops the price to $180 (a discount of $70).</p> 
<p>There was a Roku-branded 3M projector that arrived <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-05-3m-roku-team-up-for-streaming-projector.html"><ins>all the way back in 2012</ins></a>, but that required a Roku Streaming Stick. The new Aurzen model has Roku's operating system built in.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>You'll be able to operate this projector using the Roku remote. It uses the Roku interface and personalized homescreen, which includes access to The Roku Channel and a litany of streaming media apps. The projector also works with Roku's mobile app and smart home ecosystem, as well as compatible wireless speakers and soundbars. You'll be able to use Bluetooth headphones and there's a 3.5mm audio out jack.</p> 
<p>The projector is designed for indoor and outdoor use, and it supports screen sizes of between 40 and 150 inches. It has Apple AirPlay support, an HDMI port so you can plug in a games console or another device, dual 5W speakers and 1080p resolution. Brightness tops out at 330 ANSI lumens. Getting the projector ready to use should be pretty straightforward as the D1R Cube has auto focus and auto keystone correction, as well as a guided setup process.</p>

You can get half off annual subscriptions through September 18; that brings the Essential (with ads) plan down to $30 for one year instead of $60, and the Premium plan down to $60 for the year instead of $120.</p>

<p>This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer. Anyone who signs up for a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">Paramount+</a> from now through September 18 will be able to get this pricing.

New subscribers can get three free months of that plan — which, at $17 per month normally, comes out to $51 in savings for the whole period.</p> 
<p>The Family Plan allows six different users to access the platform. It offers cross-device support and each user is tied to an Apple ID, so their favorite music won't mess with anyone else's algorithm.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Apple Music actually topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html">best music streaming platforms</a>, and for good reason. It sounds great and it's easy to use. What else is there? All music is available in CD quality or higher and there are plenty of personalized playlists and the like. The platform also operates a number of live radio stations, which is fun.</p> 
<p>The service is available for Android devices, but it really shines on Apple products. To that end, the web and Windows PC apps aren’t as polished as the iOS version. It doesn't <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2025/01/streaming-payouts-hit-new-low-artists-earn/">pay artists properly</a>, but that's true of every music streaming platform. Apple Music does pay out more than Spotify, but that's an incredibly low bar.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hydrow is adding a third model to its lineup of snazzy modern-day rowing machines, and this time it’s bringing along a dollop of AI. The Hydrow Arc sits on the same footprint as its former Pro machine, but gets a bigger, 24-inch touchscreen display. It’s also equipped with what the company is calling “premium sound” and better workout recommendations.</p> 
<p>But what the company really wants to talk about is its new HydroMetrics Index, using AI to look at your workout and give you a single score at the end. That score will monitor your precision, power and endurance, letting you track your progress over time. When paired with AI, the system will also be able to offer up personalized workout recommendations that target your weak areas.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The arrival of the Arc means a broader shakeup of the company’s range, with the Hydro Pro no longer sitting atop the company’s tree. It’s being renamed as the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-28-hydrow-rowing-machine-erg-first-look.html">Hydrow Origin</a>, and will get a price cut to $2,195, while the entry-level <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hydrow-wave-smaller-cheaper-smart-rowing-machine-140012022.html">Hydrow Wave</a> will set you back $1,995. The Arc, meanwhile, takes the flagship slot, and will cost $2,295, with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hydrow;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=25723c62-4c43-4d2a-821a-ee5f9f065607&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=bed60481-50f1-4283-9e32-2881c884c733&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hydrow&amp;linkText=orders+starting+today&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2h5ZHJvdy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZWQ2MDQ4MS01MGYxLTQyODMtOWUzMi0yODgxYzg4NGM3MzMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm93LmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdoNd8lZBTuNUQKIs4sp01vSMXaf956Kl_uQcRdSdBKa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhydrow.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://hydrow.com/">orders starting today</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and a handful of other music labels <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-and-other-music-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-old-records-110108988.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against the Internet Archive over the Great 78 Project, which sought to preserve and digitize 78 rpm shellac records. Now, both parties have announced in a filing that they have <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/internet-archive-labels-settle-great-78-copyright-lawsuit-1235427887/">reached a settlement</a> and that they&#39;re filing to dismiss the lawsuit within 45 days. The plaintiffs said in the filing that they were &quot;writ[ing] to advise this court that they have settled this matter.&quot; They didn&#39;t reveal the details of their agreement, and it&#39;s very likely that they won&#39;t be made public. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/15/an-update-on-the-great-78s-lawsuit/">blog post</a> by the Internet Archive, it said they &quot;have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/internet-archives-big-battle-with-music-publishers-ends-in-settlement/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, the Internet Archive, its founder Brewster Kale and the project&#39;s recording engineer George Blood were the last ones to agree on the settlement. The labels&#39; original lawsuit focused on 2,749 recordings by artists like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong. Some of the iconic tracks made available by the Great 78 Project included classics, such as <em>White Christmas, Sing, Sing, Sing</em> and <em>The Christmas Song</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The labels argued in their lawsuit that the tracks &quot;face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed&quot; since they&#39;re already available through various music services. They then amended their lawsuit and added more recordings to the complaint, bringing the total to 4,142. If they didn&#39;t settle and the court had sided with the labels, the Internet Archive could have been ordered to pay up to $150,000 per recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Internet Archive previously <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-archive-violated-publisher-copyrights-by-lending-ebooks-court-rules-164629790.html">lost a lawsuit</a> filed by four US publishers led by the Hachette Book Group over its National Emergency Library project, which it launched during the pandemic. Under the project, it made 1.4 million ebooks, including copyrighted works, available to the public after the lockdowns closed the doors of libraries worldwide. It tried to appeal its loss, but the court <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-internet-archive-loses-its-appeal-of-ebook-copyright-case-ruling-202452279.html">sided with the publishers</a> again and determined that its emergency library couldn&#39;t operate under the fair use doctrine.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/sony-and-other-music-labels-settle-copyright-lawsuit-against-the-internet-archive-130023986.html?src=rss]]></description>

So, we were intrigued when Anker debuted a new, very thin power bank this summer: the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0F8J4WK57&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eb9291ba-8882-4db9-a3a8-ad08260f893b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Nano+5K+MagGo+Slim+power+bank&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRjhKNFdLNTc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWI5MjkxYmEtODg4Mi00ZGI5LWEzYTgtYWQwODI2MGY4OTNiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRjhKNFdLNTciLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV3bzu3AB9qcnqDQpSBZhXtZfxbq2FUlE-dwdKBIUllN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0F8J4WK57" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8J4WK57?tag=karthikl-20&amp;th=1">Anker Nano 5K MagGo Slim power bank</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, both <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Anker;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=aac3354f-048f-410b-ae8a-eb1da43ee6cf&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eb9291ba-8882-4db9-a3a8-ad08260f893b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anker&amp;linkText=Anker&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmtlci5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYTE2NjUtNWstdWx0cmEtc2xpbS1xaTItcG93ZXItYmFuaz8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViOTI5MWJhLTg4ODItNGRiOS1hM2E4LWFkMDgyNjBmODkzYiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW5rZXIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2ExNjY1LTVrLXVsdHJhLXNsaW0tcWkyLXBvd2VyLWJhbms_In0&amp;signature=AQAAAe9p_VuB5V9T1S5eWzAgBH867WxedSLBnXihvPbQAjmj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1665-5k-ultra-slim-qi2-power-bank%3F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.anker.com/products/a1665-5k-ultra-slim-qi2-power-bank?">Anker</a> and Amazon are running sales on it, dropping the price from $55 to $46. The 16 percent discount a new low for the power bank and available in the black and white models. It's just about a third of an inch thick and attaches right to your iPhone. On that note, it works with any MagSafe compatible phone with a magnetic case.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Anker's Nano 5K MagGo Slim is our pick for best, well, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">slim MagSafe power bank</a>. It took two and a half hours to charge an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to 90 percent. However, it could boost the battery to 40 percent in just under an hour. Overall, though, the minimalist design and easy to grip matte texture, really sold it to us.</p>

<p>Congratulations to those who can easily afford the $799 Apple Watch Ultra 3. But for most of us in the market for a new Apple-friendly smartwatch, the choice is more between the entry-level <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-se-3-has-an-s10-chip-and-always-on-display-173033538.html">Apple Watch SE 3</a> and the mainstay <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-hands-on-feels-and-looks-the-same-but-real-changes-are-deeper-200438367.html">Apple Watch Series 11</a>, which start at $249 and $399, respectively. That used to be more of a no-brainer default to the current Series model, since the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-2022-review-battery-life-workout-health-tracking-144551799-144551820.html">second-gen SE</a> had gone three full years without an update, in the meantime getting lapped by the Series 9 and 10. Despite the price gap, the latest models share more similarities than differences.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We're still evaluating the SE 3 and will have a full review soon. But just looking at the spec sheets, it's clear that the latest model <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-acquiesced-to-my-apple-watch-se-3-demands-mostly-220726287.html">fixes quite a few of the SE 2's flaws</a>. However, the Series 11 is still ahead when it comes to design, health tracking, battery life and premium materials, to name a few.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>That said, choosing between the two this year is more about priorities. For instance, do you just want casual step counting and sleep tracking or are you interested in using the deeper health insights? Or are you buying for child or elderly relative, and is just having cellular capability or fall detection a bigger deal?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since you can't pick one of these up at the Apple Store this minute — they'll be on display and available for sale on Friday, September 19 — there's still plenty of time. We'll walk you through the similarities and differences of these two Apple Watches. Meanwhile, if you want to know how the Series watch has changed year over year, check out the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-vs-apple-watch-series-10-should-you-upgrade-185552623.html">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Apple Watch Series 10</a>.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-apple-watch-se-3-vs-series-11-whats-basically-the-same">Apple Watch SE 3 vs. Series 11: What's basically the same</h2> 
<p>Both of these smartwatches will come equipped with watchOS 26 out of the box, but that's not the only thing they have in common.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Always-On Retina display: </strong>This is a first for SE models, and means that the display no longer fades to black after a few seconds.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Basic heart and health features: </strong>Notifications on high and low heart rate, irregular rhythms and low cardio fitness; sleep tracking with sleep apnea notifications and sleep score support; temperature sensing via your wrist; Cycle Tracking with retrospective ovulation estimates and optical heart rate sensors; and noise monitoring are fully supported on both devices.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The S10 chip: </strong>Both watches are powered by the same S10 chip, so there shouldn't be any major performance differences.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>5G support (on cellular models): </strong>While it costs $50 to $100 more — and requires monthly service — the SE 3 offers the same 5G cellular option as the Series 11, allowing wearers to text and call even when they're outside an area with Wi-Fi coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Gesture support: </strong>Both watches offer the new wrist flick and double tap gestures, which can be used for easier one-handed watch control.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Emergency SOS: </strong>Apple is continuing (until further notice) to offer this service for free to Apple Watch users.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Water resistance to 50m: </strong>Both watches are safe for swimming and bathing.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Fall Detection and Crash Detection: </strong>Apple touts both of these features as lifesavers, and they're both fully equipped on both models.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Find iPhone: </strong>Misplaced your iPhone? Press a button on either watch, and your phone will send a loud notification so you can locate it.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Fast-charge capable: </strong>Both watches can get up to an 80% charge in under an hour (with compatible fast chargers, of course). The SE 2 wasn't fast-charge capable, regardless of what charger you used.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ion-X glass face: </strong>The baseline version of both watches utilizes a version of this tough face, which is more scratch- and crack-resistant than the ones found in their earlier respective models.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>In addition to those, both watches share some other common feature sets, including storage (64GB), sensors (altimeter, compass, gyroscope) and wireless options (Wi-Fi 4, Bluetooth 5.3 and nearly identical GPS offerings).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-se-3-vs-series-11-heres-the-stuff-you-wont-get-if-you-stick-with-the-se-line">SE 3 vs. Series 11: What the more affordable watch lacks</h2> 
<p>If you decide to stick with the SE 3 instead of the Series 11, here's what you'll miss out on:&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Advanced health features: </strong>Hypertension notifications (<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-clearance-for-hypertension-alerts-120046138.html">cleared by the FDA</a>), a new feature that detects signs of high blood pressure, are not available on the SE 3. You also won't have access to the ECG app or blood oxygen monitoring. Electrical heart sensors are also not on the SE 3.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Brighter and larger display: </strong>The Series 11 offers a screen that's twice as bright as the SE 3. Additionally, both Series 11 sizes are larger: You can choose between the 46mm (compared to the SE's 44mm), or the smaller 42mm size (40mm for SE).</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Thinner case design: </strong>The Series 11 is nearly 10 percent thinner than the SE 3.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Longer battery life: </strong>The Series 11 has a battery life of up to 24 hours (38 hours in low power mode), while the SE 3 gets up to 18 hours (32 hours in low power mode). That means you could be left charging your watch when you need it the most.&nbsp;</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Titanium options:</strong> A premium material, titanium, is available for the Series 11 watch. If you go that route, it has a sapphire crystal display, too.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>More color options:</strong> The Series 11 has seven color options, whereas the SE 3 model has only two. The aluminum frame comes in jet black, rose gold, silver and space gray, while the titanium frame comes in slate, gold and natural. The SE 3 comes in midnight and starlight (aluminum only).</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>There are a handful of other niche features where the Series 11 edges out the SE 3 (depth gauge, water temperature sensor, dust resistance), but the ones listed above are the big ones.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-choose-between-the-se-3-and-the-series-11">How to choose between the SE 3 and the Series 11</h2> 
<p>Now that you know what's similar and what's different, you should consider which features you'll actually use, how much you're willing to pay and how long you plan to keep the smartwatch. If you're looking for cutting-edge health tracking — like hypertension notifications and the ECG app — longer battery life and a more fashion-forward smartwatch, the Series 11 is definitely your starting point. It starts at $399, or $499 for cellular models. (Going the titanium route sends the price upwards to $699 or more.)</p> 
<p> <core-commerce id="a8f8187a6fd942fd80e20b833b53fdd8" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smartwatch-Aluminium-Always/dp/B0FQFL8PZ5?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>But as we've noted above, the SE 3 has really narrowed the feature gap compared to its predecessor. If you can live without those more advanced health features and you're okay with your watchband doing the heavy lifting for your wrist styling, the SE 3 may well be all you need. And because the addition of cellular capability is just a $50 add-on for that model, it's a much more affordable choice for kids and seniors (where always-on connectivity is often more important).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Apple Watch SE 3 starts at $249, and jumps to just $299 for cellular capability. That's a hefty savings for a watch that retains nearly all the key safety offerings — and many of the health features — of the Series 11, so take a closer look at it before you scoop up the pricier model. It may be all you need.&nbsp;</p>

Now, attention is shifting to the app&#39;s Chinese algorithm, with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/550e4680-89e7-4b59-bb5d-2064cd6799c7"><em>Financial Times </em>reporting</a> it will be used in the US version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Jingtao, deputy director of the China&#39;s national internet regulator, told reporters that the deal included &quot;licensing the algorithm and other intellectual property rights.&quot; The <em>Financial Times</em> further reports that US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said a US version of TikTok would have some &quot;Chinese characteristics&quot; but that American investors would control it.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That&#39;s a significant turnaround as TikTok&#39;s algorithm has been at the heart of many conversations and analysis about the app&#39;s presence in the US. Lawmakers have sought to analyze how it operates and pushed for TikTok to be banned or sold in large part to move away from Chinese technology. President Trump holds the power to approve any potential deals.&nbsp;</p>

Not much appears to have changed with Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">smartwatch</a>, with no redesign to be seen. Still, that isn’t to say the Apple Watch Series 11 is unimpressive or unexciting. It has new health-related features, improved durability, 5G connectivity, support for a wrist-flick gesture and, for the first time in years, the promise of longer battery life.</p> 
<p>The most noteworthy of these is Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-includes-5g-and-a-hypertension-tracking-feature-172451506.html">new hypertension alerts system</a>, which only <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-approval-for-hypertension-alerts-120046036.html">received FDA clearance last week</a> soon after <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event/">the “Awe dropping” launch event</a>. The feature has yet to roll out to review units, and will remain untested until later this week, when I can enable it. Thankfully, it’s not a tool that will impact my experience with the Series 11 in my daily life, as it’s something that should work mostly in the background and only alert me if it notices I might have high blood pressure.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Because of that, I’m not going to be able to evaluate its practicality in this review, and I will update this piece when I’ve had a chance to use it. To be clear, though, even after it arrives, you won’t be able to use this feature ad-hoc to get blood pressure readings. Right now, all I can say is I think it’s an important area of health to pay attention to and I’m glad Apple is giving it due attention.</p> 
<p>Of all the newness coming to the Series 11, the one that more people might encounter more frequently are the sleep score, wrist flick gesture and longer battery life.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-a-very-apple-approach-to-the-sleep-score">A very Apple approach to the Sleep Score</h2> 
<p>In the land of sleep-tracking wearables, sleep scores are <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-14-basis-peak-review.html">far</a> from a <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-fitbit-versa-2-review-alexa-amoled.html">new feature</a>. But Apple is introducing it with the Watch Series 11, and as usual, its approach is a bit different from the competition. Whereas the likes of Fitbit, Google and Samsung will present you with a number and some data on how you slept, maybe assigning an animal to represent your profile, Apple’s score is shown in a ring with three colors. They represent the three components your Sleep Score is being calculated from: duration, interruptions and bedtime.</p> 
<p>The first two are pretty self-explanatory; the longer you sleep and the less you wake up during the night, the better your score. As for the last one, Apple is looking for consistency in the hours at which you go to bed. The idea is that the routine helps your body maintain some consistency and better prepare for recovery.</p> 
<p>I’m a huge proponent of getting more sleep, but I never was a stickler for bedtime schedules. As a reformed night owl that used to go to bed at 2AM and wake up closer to 9AM, I now go to bed by midnight and rise at 6AM. I’m surprised that despite having to get up earlier nowadays, I can still feel refreshed and energetic, as long as I’ve been routinely getting enough rest at roughly the same time each night.</p> 
<p>While I haven’t worn the Series 11 to bed for that many nights, the Sleep Scores I’ve received so far have been telling. The first was 82, after a long day checking out of a hotel, meeting up with a friend from Singapore and then moving to a different friend’s home in California. I only got around to unpacking after dinner and a long heart-to-heart chat that lasted hours, so by the time I collapsed in bed it was about 1:30AM.</p> 
<p>The next night, since I was already unpacked, I was able to fall asleep a bit earlier, just past midnight. The result? A Sleep Score of 97, with full marks across the bedtime and duration sections and only one interruption of three minutes. When I finally got home and forced myself to wear the watch to bed, a combination of jetlag and general anxiety brought my score down to 53, with the duration of 2 hours and 17 minutes being the main contributing factor.</p>

<p>Not only did the numbers seem to match how rested I felt, it also felt like Apple accurately detected when I had drifted off into slumber. I did find it funny how the Series 11 almost immediately told me to try and move about to meet my Stand goal for the hour, and even though I hardly stirred, it quickly told me I had moved enough to hit the mark.</p> 
<p>Compared to the offerings from Google and Samsung, the broad strokes of Apple’s sleep score are similar. In my experience, I’d get about the same numbers for those types of nights. But it’s not the Score alone that matters. I like that Apple’s system makes it very easy to see at a glance what areas I should strive to improve. It’s almost like closing your activity rings in Fitness or watchOS — because it’s so clear on the Sleep Score’s ring where your deficits might be, it makes trying to hit a target a little easier to visualize.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, sleep scores on the Fitbit app, which is what Pixel Watches use, will <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236407?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-to-find-sleeping-heart-rate-details">show more data as you keep tapping on the charts</a>.</p> 
<p>I do prefer Google (or Fitbit) when it comes to the interface and data visualization, though. On Apple’s Health app, scrolling through your previous results isn’t as simple as swiping horizontally through pages. I also wish I could tap the “interruptions” scale to see exactly what times I stirred or woke up. I eventually did find that information, but I had to go to the Sleep graph in its dedicated section to see more. It’s just a bit unintuitive and requires a lot of tapping and swiping around to find things.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-the-series-11s-hardier-design-is-a-subtle-refinement">The Series 11’s hardier design is a subtle refinement</h2> 
<p>I usually loathe going to bed with a smartwatch on, but because the Series 11 is so thin and light, it wasn’t too bad. Its dimensions are identical to the Series 10, measuring 9.7mm thin and weighing about 0.3 grams more. As my relatively high Sleep Scores show, I didn’t actually jolt awake in the middle of the night like I usually did with previous heavier, clunkier watches. (I still hate wearing watches to sleep, though.)</p> 
<p>More importantly, the Series 11 also has an IonX glass coating that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as the Series 10, which might account for the slight increase in weight. While I didn’t try very hard to test that claim, I’ve certainly bumped my review unit against lots of hard surfaces, including the iPhone 17 Pro, and have yet to see a scratch.</p> 
<p>I even knocked it against the Series 10 on my other wrist as I laid my hands on top of each other in various yoga poses that involved lying face down, and neither device was damaged. Given that the Series 10 I’ve been wearing remains pretty pristine after a year, I’m confident that the Series 11’s hardier material means it’ll stay similarly unmarred.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-workout-tracking-gestures-and-watchos-26">Workout-tracking, gestures and watchOS 26</h2> 
<p>During my time with the Series 11, I tracked a variety of workouts, including a yoga class, as well as my usual sessions of outdoor walking, functional strength and cross training. I noticed little differences here compared to my Series 10, and the main changes were the watchOS 26 interface. After I turned on Workout Buddy, selected one of three available voices and let it finish downloading, I had to set some targets and connect headphones before I even heard anything during my sessions. I don’t usually work out with headphones on, but I can see the coaching being useful for an aspirational future where I’m perhaps trying to hit a 6-minute mile (my current time is about 8 minutes).</p>

<p>I will note that a lot of what makes the Series 11 feel new is in the software, which will be rolling out to older Apple Watches soon. <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">watchOS 26</a> brings the Liquid Glass style, which allowed me to use some slick-looking fonts on my clock. I also liked the larger buttons across the interface and the refreshing feeling of looking at the translucent cards instead of the version before. It’s just a visual change that makes things feel updated, and my eyes welcomed it.</p> 
<p>The Series 11 also gets a new wrist flick gesture that feels familiar for those of us who have covered the smartwatch industry since its inception. The gist is that you can quickly twist your wrist away from you to interact with your wearable. On other devices, you could use this action to scroll through lists of apps, for instance. On the Apple Watch Series 11, you have to first raise your wrist when a notification arrives, then flick your wrist to dismiss it and return to your watch face. This also works to end calls, alarms and timers. I was able to use this to silence an alarm, as long as I first raised my wrist before flicking.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-that-lasts-longer-than-a-day">Battery that lasts longer than a day</h2> 
<p>When Apple said during its keynote that the Series 11 will last 24 hours thanks to its re-engineered battery, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html">my colleague Sam Rutherford scoffed</a>. That number is measly compared to the multi-day runtimes promised by the likes of Pixel and Samsung watches, let alone Garmin’s almost week-long estimates. But <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=36cf1f2c-017d-428a-afaa-69f826446fc3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=when+you+consider+Apple+promises+up+to+18+hours+for+the+Series+10&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vd2F0Y2gvY29tcGFyZS8_bW9kZWxMaXN0PXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy0xMSx3YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtMTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2Y2YxZjJjLTAxN2QtNDI4YS1hZmFhLTY5ZjgyNjQ0NmZjMyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3dhdGNoL2NvbXBhcmUvP21vZGVsTGlzdD13YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtMTEsd2F0Y2gtc2VyaWVzLTEwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcVcfO99KLwUnNLAw7y02Nlh9x0rpq-WpdRnaBMygrff&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2Fcompare%2F%3FmodelList%3Dwatch-series-11%2Cwatch-series-10" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/?modelList=watch-series-11,watch-series-10">when you consider Apple promises up to 18 hours for the Series 10</a>, the improvement is nothing to sneeze at.</p> 
<p>Also, 24 hours is an estimate depending on how you use your Apple Watch. Many people only put their watch on when heading out for a walk, run or workout, while others use it all day. That estimate includes time for overnight sleep tracking, with 18 hours devoted to daytime “activities like checking the time, receiving notifications, using apps and doing a 60-minute workout.”</p> 
<p>The gain in runtime is thanks in part to a 9 percent bigger battery in the 42mm model and an 11 percent larger one in the 46mm version, as well as optimizations in software and a new modem that also supports 5G.</p> 
<p>The Series 11 certainly outlasted the 24-hour estimate in my experience. It usually lasts one and a half days, including some light activity tracking, media control and sleep tracking. One day, I pulled it off the charger at 2PM, tracked a workout at 4PM, used the camera remote control and viewfinder for about 20 minutes, went to dinner and wore it to bed. I woke up at 8AM with 39 percent left in the tank. Even hours later at 3:15PM, I still had a healthy 22 percent to work with. On a different day, I woke up with 29 percent of juice, tracked a 37-minute morning walk and had about 20 percent remaining. The energy efficiency does seem to have improved.</p> 
<p>This also means continuous runtimes for specific activities have been increased. For example, you can run for an extra hour while tracking your heart rate, GPS and using other Apple Watch features for eight hours straight. Or, more likely, simply run a marathon without worrying about having juice after.</p>

<p>Apple was also able to boost its low power mode, now squeezing up to 38 hours of juice when enabled. It will turn off the always on display, disconnect cellular and Wi-Fi connections and also limit sensor activity, so background heart rate measurements and related alerts won’t work. I switched it on at 9:20PM one night when the battery was at 86 percent, in anticipation of a long day away from a charger.</p> 
<p>The next day, after tracking about three hours of sleep overnight, a few workouts and general testing, the watch still held fairly strong at 22 percent at 8:50PM. I did have to restart the device and turn off low power mode a few times throughout the day just to check that certain features (like the AOD and gestures) were working, though, so uninterrupted use of the mode might get more hours out of it.</p> 
<p>Charging is also quite speedy. I placed the Series 11 on the charging puck at about 1PM with 8 percent left, and came back ten minutes later to see it had already reached 38 percent. Just over thirty minutes later, it was fully recharged. That, of course, is with an Apple-supplied fast charger.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-which-apple-watch-is-right-for-you">Which Apple Watch is right for you?</h2> 
<p>If you’re reading this review, you’re not likely to be considering non-Apple watches, so I won’t even compare the Series 11 to the Galaxy Watch 8 or the Pixel Watch 4. We haven’t even reviewed that latter one, anyway. You also probably don’t currently own <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html">a Series 10</a>, though if you do and are wondering if this is worth an upgrade, read on.</p> 
<p>For those on older Apple Watches (like the Series 9 or earlier), the Series 11 is a solid upgrade. The battery life improvements will be meaningful even if you’re coming from the Series 10, though if you’re moving on from anything older the impact will be greater. You’ll appreciate the bigger screen with wider viewing angles, thinner profile and general modern features like the watchOS refresh and AI-based tools.</p> 
<p>If you’re considering one of the three new Apple Watches, this year is a trickier situation than usual. Because it added an always on display and faster charging to the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-acquiesced-to-my-apple-watch-se-3-demands-mostly-220726287.html">SE 3</a>, Apple has made the entry-level smartwatch a no-brainer for pretty much anyone considering a starter device. For $250, that watch gives you everything the Series 11 does, except in a slightly bulkier case and smaller, dimmer display. You’ll be giving up ECG and blood oxygen features, as well as hypertension alerts and sensors for depth and water temperature. Battery life is also a bit shorter, and you won’t have an ultra-wideband chip for precision Find My.</p> 
<p>But with the Watch SE 3, you’ll still be able to access a wide range of health and fitness features like wrist temperature monitoring, sleep score, emergency SOS, fall and crash detection and more. It’s a compelling option at an appealing price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>I don’t expect companies to completely retool their products, especially 11 generations in. The Apple Watch Series 11 is a refinement of an already winning formula, packing a device that’s always on your person with exactly the type of passive features you’d want in something like that. Whether it’s quietly keeping tabs on your heart health and blood pressure changes, or providing better information on how well you slept, or even saving your life if you’ve fallen or gotten lost in the wilderness, the Series 11 is a capable companion. With longer battery life this time, it promises to provide even more peace of mind. Nifty touches like Liquid Glass in watchOS 26, Workout Buddy and 5G connectivity are icing on a rich, substantial cake.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-review-a-reliable-wearable-for-when-it-matters-most-120016945.html?src=rss]]></description>

Other upgrades include the S10 chip, a slightly larger display, bigger battery that lasts up to 42 hours, support for 5G, as well as the hypertension and sleep score features coming to the Series 11 (and also the Ultra 2 and several older Apple Watch models).</p>
<p>While I continue to review the Series 11 before spending more time with the Ultra 3 (and the SE 3), I wanted to share what it’s like to use satellite communications on the wearable and how it differs from the approach on the Pixel Watch 4. To be clear, I have yet to receive a review unit of the Pixel Watch 4, so my impressions are based on a recorded demo at a hands-on event. For the Watch Ultra 3, I have a review unit and am using its built-in demo tool to connect to satellites.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can launch satellite communications on the Watch Ultra 3 in a few ways. Add it to the Control Center or as a complication on any watch face, and you’ll get options to send messages, share your location or contact emergency services. The first two require paid cellular service for your smartwatch. The device will also automatically suggest satellite connectivity when you’re offline, though that’s a situation I have yet to encounter. Regardless of where you use it, a lot of the process of connecting to a satellite is similar to that on the iPhone 14 and newer. If you’ve never tried that before, hang tight, as I will explain the steps a little further down.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-emergency-satellite-communications-on-the-apple-watch-ultra-3">Emergency satellite communications on the Apple Watch Ultra 3</h2>
<p>There’s also another screen where you might encounter a prompt to link to a satellite — in the phone dialer. Whether you’re on the watch or iPhone, Apple imagines (and likely hopes) that dialing your local emergency hotline is your first step. Here in the US, that number is 911. Of course, as a socially responsible person, I didn’t want to unnecessarily burden emergency services and did not try this out myself on the Watch Ultra 3. Instead, Apple representatives gave us a demo in Cupertino last week, and made a call to 911 that was routed to the company’s own call centers.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the process for emergency SOS via satellite is different from using Messages or Find My via satellite because users are likely to be dialing their local services first and foremost. Only when that fails will the emergency satellite communications interface kick in. Once you select the Emergency SOS via Satellite option that appears after a few seconds or when your watch detects you’re offline, you’ll be shown a list of guidelines, recommending you be outside with a clear view of the sky and explaining that transmission will take longer than when sent over cellular networks.</p>
<p>After that, you’ll be presented a series of multiple choice questions to inform rescue services of your condition and environment. Thanks to the Watch Ultra 3’s larger screen, the system’s large buttons and readable font weren’t hard to see, and I could make out the options at arm’s length. A few taps later, we had selected some answers indicating we were “lost or trapped,” alone, unharmed and near steep terrain. The Apple representative performing our demo also opted to notify the emergency contacts set up on the Watch Ultra 3.</p>

<p>Once that was done, the watch displayed an interface similar to the version on the iPhone, featuring a glowing arc and translucent image of the earth. Words on the screen said “Try to get a clear view of the sky” and guided the wearer in various directions to attempt to connect to satellites passing overhead. After a link was established, the words “Sending report” appeared with a progress bar below.</p>
<p>We had to wait a minute and a half for the message to go through, which is quite long, but it was probably not the usual amount of time. At about 25 seconds in, it seemed like the connection was lost and had to be re-established. That may seem like a long while to hold your wrist up, but Apple did say you only need to lift your arm while establishing a connection to the satellite and not while the information was being sent. I believe the rep only had their arm up so we could more easily see the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, when the report had been delivered, the Watch Ultra 3 took us to the Message window showing a confirmation that the request had been received. It also tells the wearer to reply with “Stop” if emergency services were not or no longer required.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-using-satellites-to-send-messages-and-your-location">Using satellites to send Messages and your location</h2>
<p>Outside of using satellite communications when you’re in need of emergency services, you can also send messages or share your location when you’re off the grid. This, again, mirrors the iPhone version of this service. You can go to the Find My app on the Watch Ultra 3 to share your location when you’re out of coverage, and your position can be shared up to once every 15 minutes to previously added contacts. In the Messages app on the watch, you can contact people you’ve chatted with in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>In my experience, it was easiest to add Satellite as a complication to a watch face. Tapping the button will bring up the Satellite screen with options to try a demo, go to Messages, share your location or contact emergency services. Like on the iPhone, the demo is there for users to get familiar with the process of connecting to a satellite, so they’re not completely unfamiliar in high pressure situations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I spent most of my time with the Ultra 3 so far in areas that had good coverage and signal, I never really got a chance to try to send a message or my location via satellite. First world problems, I know. I’ll embark on an adventure upstate soon to check it out, though, and will report back after.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with Messages or Find My via Satellite on iPhones may wonder why those features exist. It’s not just for the frivolous desire to play with a novel feature. You can send texts, emojis and tapback reactions to let a loved one know you arrived in the desert safely for Burning Man, for example. Texts go through with a delivery message that says “sent via Satellite,” so your recipient will understand you have limited connectivity and can’t engage in a full-blown tea-spilling session right then.</p>
<p>Or, if you’re like my partner and sometimes go camping in the middle of nowhere, sharing your location when you’ve arrived at your campsite can bring some peace of mind. (Note: I don’t go camping.) My partner tends to favor forested areas, though, where satellite connectivity would struggle with the dense foliage, hampering its usefulness.</p>
<p>To be very clear, emergency SOS via Satellite will be supported on all models of the Watch Ultra 3, but satellite communications for Messages and Find My require a paid cellular plan. With all purchases of the Ultra 3, Apple is providing two years of satellite service for emergency, Messages and Find My.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-apple-watch-ultra-3-vs-pixel-watch-4-the-satellite-comparison">Apple Watch Ultra 3 vs Pixel Watch 4: The satellite comparison</h2>
<p>That’s somewhat similar to Google’s approach for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-hands-on-a-long-thoughtful-list-of-improvements-160015292.html">the Pixel Watch 4</a>, where Satellite SOS “is included at no additional charge for 2 years after launch.” However, only the LTE models of the Pixel Watch support its satellite feature, and it’s only available in the contiguous United States at the moment. Google’s version also uses Skylo’s Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN), and adopts similar haptic and audio cues to the Watch Ultra 3’s in the connecting process. One area that appears to be different is that the Pixel Watch 4 will offer a &quot;check replies&quot; button that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-watch-satellite-sos/">Google says</a> “guides you to re-establish connection for updates from emergency services as needed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s Find My and emergency satellite features will work in 18 countries at launch, including the US, UK, Japan, Switzerland, Australia and others. Messages via satellite is limited to Mexico, Canada and the US at the moment.</p>

<p>As I continue to put the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFHVZYL&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e5f00510-9739-4bdf-ac16-fefc2a381f0e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Watch+Ultra+3&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSFZaWUwvcmVmPWZzX2Ffd3QyX3VzMD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNWYwMDUxMC05NzM5LTRiZGYtYWMxNi1mZWZjMmEzODFmMGUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vZHAvQjBGUUZIVlpZTC9yZWY9ZnNfYV93dDJfdXMwIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdLGuAXWh4NrI7S1UuErnYoSIB05HULJBvw89c6Ek_5h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFHVZYL%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us0" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFHVZYL/ref=fs_a_wt2_us0?th=1">Watch Ultra 3</a> through its paces, it’s worth noting what changes the latest model has over its predecessor. Like I mentioned, it has a larger display while maintaining the same size, thanks to thinner bezels (which Apple said are 24 percent slimmer). It also uses an LTPO 3 panel that enables a faster refresh rate in Always On mode, as well as wide-angle OLEDs for easier reading at off angles.</p>
<p>I’ve found the Watch Ultra 3 lightweight and comfortable to wear so far, and I enjoy tapping buttons or reading messages on its 49mm screen. Unfortunately, I am also a person who wears long-sleeved shirts that are snug at the wrist, making the bigger watches a harder sell, especially as the weather gets colder here in New York. I did find it amusing when the Night mode got triggered any time I tucked the Ultra 3 under my sleeve, turning the watch face’s dials, complications and other elements red.</p>
<p>The Watch Ultra 3 gets the same 5G support, hypertension notifications and Sleep Score as the Series 11, along with watchOS 26 upgrades like Workout Buddy and Liquid Glass. I need a few more days with the Ultra 3 before I can vouch for its 42-hour battery estimate, but it’s nice to see longer runtimes on an endurance watch.</p>
<p>My evaluation of those new features and whether they add up to a meaningful package will be ready soon in a full review. In the meantime, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is available for pre-order and will arrive in stores on September 19.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-3-a-closer-look-at-its-satellite-communications-tools-120012387.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s third-gen pro earbuds make a very strong case for upgrading. Alongside all those iPhones and Watches, Apple revealed the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">AirPods Pro 3</a>, packing in major new features, like live translation and heart-rate sensing, all while tangibly boosting active noise cancellation (ANC).</p>
<p>Those ANC upgrades? Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more noise, while new foam-infused ear tips play a major role here too, since they offer increased passive noise isolation. Apple says these buds cancel twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times more than the original AirPods Pro.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/62714520-92e2-11f0-bf7f-dfe45412c449" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/62714520-92e2-11f0-bf7f-dfe45412c449" style="height:427px;width:640px;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="f5503af5-9a5e-3c74-95c5-25eafec28597"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Then there’s the heart-rate sensors. While the tech debuted on the Powerbeats Pro 2, it’s got a more mainstream home in the AirPods Pro 3. Heart-rate data from the AirPods can be accessed by Apple’s own Fitness app and other workout apps, like Nike Run Club and Peloton. In fact, during his review, Billy Steele found they delivered just as much heart-rate data as his Apple Watch.</p>
<p>There are some minor caveats: Battery life is less than previous models and the new shape of AirPod could take some time getting used to. Still, the newest AirPods garnered a score of 90 in our review. We like them. A lot.</p>

<p>Amazon has a big event coming up and Panos Panay, who leads the company’s Devices &amp; Services team, will be on hand. This strongly suggests Amazon will announce some new hardware. The press invite also included a composite image of various Amazon devices. These appear to include a Kindle ereader, a Fire TV of some kind and an Echo speaker. Those are three of the company’s biggest product categories.</p>

<p>It was a jam-packed Nintendo Direct last Friday. First up, September 13 is the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in Japan, which is a big reason this Direct took place on a Friday. The company revealed the title for the next Mario movie. It’s called <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, and it’s coming to cinemas in the US on April 3. Also, the Virtual Boy is <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html"><ins>coming back</ins></a>!

<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the United States and China have reached a framework deal on TikTok. Speaking to reporters in Madrid after two days of talks with his Chinese counterparts, Bessent said, “It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” President Trump said in a Truth Social post that he will be speaking with Xi Jinping this Friday regarding the potential deal, among other things.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster. I tried out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint's top competitors</a> in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-budgeting-apps-we-tested">Other budgeting apps we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-budgeting-apps">How we test budgeting apps</h2> 
<p>Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-budgeting-app-faqs">Budgeting app FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-plaid-and-how-does-it-work">What is Plaid and how does it work?</h3> 
<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-did-mint-shut-down">Why did Mint shut down?</h3> 
<p>When parent company Intuit <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intuit-is-closing-down-mint-its-popular-free-budget-tracking-app-054145229.html">announced</a> in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. "Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features," Mint wrote on its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/mint-app-news/intuit-credit-karma-welcomes-minters/">product blog</a>. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a>, you have some decent options.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-rocket-money">What about Rocket Money?</h3>

If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether you're all-in on the Apple ecosystem or just want a reliable pair of wireless earbuds, the best AirPods can deliver great sound, seamless pairing and smart features that are hard to beat. Over the years, Apple has expanded its AirPods lineup to suit a variety of users — from the minimalist appeal of the standard models to the premium experience of the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max with plush ear cups and active noise cancellation.<br><br>With rumors of new AirPods on the horizon and the 2nd generation AirPods Pro still going strong, now’s a great time to figure out which model suits you best. Some offer snug silicone tips for better isolation, while others prioritize comfort and simplicity. All of them work effortlessly across your Apple devices, whether you're switching from iPhone to iPad or taking a video call on your laptop.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-you-need-to-know-about-airpods">What you need to know about AirPods</h2> 
<p>When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-4-with-anc">AirPods 4 with ANC</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> represent the first time active noise cancellation has been available on the open-wear, “regular” AirPods. Design-wise, they’re the same as the non-ANC model, so the difference is entirely in the features list. This more expensive version adds Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness and a wireless charging case. The ANC isn’t as powerful as the AirPods Pro 2, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 doesn’t completely seal off your ears. The noise-canceling performance is definitely useful though, working best with constant, low-frequency annoyances like fans and white noise machines. Lastly, you won’t get access to Apple’s hearing test and hearing aid features, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 with ANC doesn’t seal off your ears, which would affect accuracy and effectiveness.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss]]></description>

Of course, it also provides Amazon a way to boost sales during the same time period and, arguably more importantly, increase the number of overall <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c987251c-de7c-4b11-b870-a8c676d060ee&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Prime+subscribers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2FtYXpvbnByaW1lP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM5ODcyNTFjLWRlN2MtNGIxMS1iODcwLWE4YzY3NmQwNjBlZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9hbWF6b25wcmltZSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaeowyo_ITnsLxyXuHanW69CrFZp1N-lDZ00fbJbpFE3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Prime subscribers</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As for the deals we expect, Prime Day(s) is often a boon for discounts on apparel, shoes, household goods and more. Discounts on elecontrics are some of the most sought after, but it can be difficult to decipher if you're actually getting a good deal or not. Here's what we at Engadge think you should keep in mind before shopping during October Prime Day.</p> 
<p><strong>Use a price tracker.</strong> Handy online price trackers like CamelCamelCamel and Keepa show price history charts for items available on Amazon. That way you can see if those earbuds you've been eyeing were $10 cheaper last week, or if the Prime Day price is the lowest in months. You can also add things to your cart or wishlist ahead of Prime Day, and you'll see an alert the next time you visit your cart or wishlist if any items have dropped in price since you added them.</p> 
<p><strong>Shop early, and shop for the big stuff first.</strong> Over the past few years, Amazon has made a habit of releasing solid Prime Day deals in the two weeks leading up to the actual shopping event. Historically, many of those deals stick around through the event itself, so if you seen something on your list drop in price a week before Prime Day, it could be a good time to buy it. It's also wise to look for big-ticket items first like robot vacuums, premium headphones and more when you're shopping an event like this.</p> 
<p><strong>Amazon devices will be some of the best deals.</strong> Most commonly, we see Amazon's own devices — Kindles, Echo speakers, Blink and Ring cameras and more — drop to record-low prices during Prime Day and in the weeks leading up to it. If you have anything like that on your shopping list, we highly recommend waiting until at least the last few days of September to buy any that have early discounts.</p> 
<p><strong>Stock up on stocking stuffers.</strong> We've noticed a trend of affordable tech getting even cheaper during Prime Day over the past couple of years. Think things like wireless chargers, charging cables, power banks, Bluetooth trackers, cheap speakers and more. If you need a few backup charging cables or want to pick up a couple of stocking stuffers early in preparation for the gifting season, definitely use Prime Day deals to your advantage to do that.</p> 
<p><strong>Lightning deals are generally questionable deals.</strong> "Lightning deals" are Amazon's limited-time discounts that are, thankfully, clearly labeled with the amount of time remaining to grab the sale price. In our experience, only a handful of these flash deals are actually worth your money — but if you see something that’s been on your wishlist drop in price for only a few hours, it’s in your best interest to grab it immediately.</p> 
<p>If history is any indication, the sale prices we see during October Prime Day will be similar (and in some cases, the same) as those we see during <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/">Cyber Monday</a>. If you can shop early and cross a few things off your list, we recommend doing so. Engadget will be covering October Prime Day in full, so if you have a lot of tech on your to-buy list, be sure to check back here on Prime Day for the best tech deals we can find.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta Connect, the company&#39;s annual event dedicated to all things AR, VR, AI and the metaverse is just days away. And once again, it seems like it will be a big year for smart glasses and AI.</p>
<p>This year, the event will take a slightly different format than in the past. Mark Zuckerberg is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.meta.com/connect/agenda/">scheduled</a> to kick things off with an evening keynote at 5PM PT on Wednesday, September 17. A developer keynote with other executives will take place the next morning on September 18, beginning at 10AM, with more talks and developer sessions to follow.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear why Meta changed things up this year, but it is shaping up to be a particularly eventful year for Connect. We&#39;re expecting two new models of smart glasses, including Meta&#39;s first to have a display, as well as new Meta AI and metaverse updates. As usual, Engadget will be reporting live from Zuckerberg&#39;s keynote at Meta HQ, but until then, here&#39;s a closer look at what&#39;s coming and what to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-new-and-updated-smart-glasses">New and updated smart glasses</h2>
<p>The biggest news of the day will be Meta&#39;s next-generation of smart glasses. The frames, often referred to by their reported internal name &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/report-meta-could-release-its-first-true-ar-headset-as-soon-as-2027-222502610.html">Hypernova</a>,&quot; will be the first consumer-ready glasses from Meta that have a display. We already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks.</p>
<p>While the frames are expected to have a small display on one side, they won&#39;t offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we&#39;ve seen on Meta&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html">Orion prototype</a>. Instead the display will allow you to view things like notifications and photo previews. The glasses will also come with a dedicated wristband, similar to what the company showed off with Orion, that allows the wearer to control specific features through hand gestures.</p>

<p>The glasses, which are expected to go on sale later this year, will likely cost around $800, according <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html">to reports</a>. And while there was previously some suggestion the glasses may be sold under a different EssilorLuxottica brand, it now seems they will indeed be Ray-Ban branded. On Monday, just days ahead of Connect, a promotional video for &quot;Meta Ray-Ban Display&quot; glasses <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/video-of-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-surfaces-ahead-of-connect-194713365.html">surfaced online</a>. The video showed glasses with clear frames, a heads-up display and a wristband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video doesn&#39;t show a price, but given the likely  higher price tag — most of Meta&#39;s other Ray-Ban-branded glasses cost around $300 — it seems the company is positioning this as a higher-end product that will have a more limited appeal. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658">suggested</a> Hypernova will have a &quot;negligible&quot; share of the overall smart glasses market.</p>
<p>The video also seemingly confirms a new version of Oakley sunglasses, based on the brand&#39;s Sphaera glasses. It shows a pair of the familiar wraparound frames with a single camera in the center near the nose. Those glasses, which have been previously reported, aren&#39;t expected to have a display. Previous leaks have also hinted at new versions of non-display Ray-Ban glasses too, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/renders-of-next-gen-ray-ban-meta-glasses-leak/">leaked renders</a> showing a pair of sunglasses and a version with clear frames.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EssilorLuxottica&#39;s Chief Wearables Officer, Rocco Basilico, has also teased that it will be an &quot;extra special&quot; year at Connect. In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@roccobasilico/post/DOoIKIZEbFF">a post</a> on Threads tagging Meta, he wrote that he was &quot;proud to share what we’ve built together.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could also see new third-party glasses integrations. As <em>UploadVR </em>recently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-agenda-reveals-smart-glasses-sdk/">pointed out,</a> early versions of the Connect schedule for developers seemingly confirms that Meta is getting ready to give developers access to its smart glasses. Up to now, the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within Meta&#39;s ecosystem (with a few exceptions like Spotify and Audible). Allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-meta-ai">Meta AI</h2>
<p>As with other recent years, AI will be a major theme throughout. Meta AI has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-already-has-1-billion-active-users-120023875.html">a billion</a> monthly users (something Zuckerberg will surely remind us of) and I&#39;m expecting to see new features for Meta AI both on the company&#39;s glasses and within its apps. <em>Business Insider</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-hires-contractors-build-ai-chatbot-characters-key-markets-2025-9">reports</a> the company has been working on new lineup of non-English speaking &quot;character-driven&quot; bots for its apps. (Meta&#39;s character-centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny, with the company <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-re-training-its-ai-so-it-wont-discuss-self-harm-or-have-romantic-conversations-with-teens-182418587.html">recently blocking</a> teens&#39; access to many user-generated characters amid growing safety concerns.)</p>
<p>Outside of Meta&#39;s chatbots, I&#39;m hoping Zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create &quot;superintelligence.&quot; As I wrote in July, his <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html">initial manifesto</a> that outlined his vision was confusing at best. The CEO has recently reorganized Meta&#39;s AI teams around the idea, and has been on a very expensive <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-invests-148-billion-in-scale-ai-and-recruits-its-ceo-130029612.html">hiring spree</a> to recruit executives and researchers for the effort.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zuckerberg could use Connect to shore up expectations around its Llama models. The company&#39;s larger Llama 4 model has <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-behemoth-llama-4-model-might-still-be-months-away-221240585.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc">been delayed</a> and reports suggest Meta&#39;s engineers have been struggling to improve it. There are other signs that Zuckerberg may be <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html">backing away</a> from open-source AI.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-the-metaverse">What about the metaverse?</h2>
<p>While the metaverse has taken somewhat of a backseat to AI in recent years, it wouldn&#39;t be Connect without some VR-related news. In a recent Instagram post, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth teased &quot;metaverse software&quot; updates related to Horizon Worlds at Connect. The company recently offered <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-ai-powered-npcs-to-the-metaverse-231605236.html">a preview</a> to developers of its plan to bring AI-powered NPCs to the metaverse, and I expect we&#39;ll hear more about how generative AI could help shape the metaverse.</p>
<p>And while there are no new Quest headsets expected, we could hear more about those third-party VR headsets that will run Meta&#39;s VR software. Last year, the company announced that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-opens-quest-os-to-third-parties-including-asus-and-lenovo-163127396.html">ASUS, Lenovo and Xbox</a> were working on Meta Horizon OS headsets. We haven&#39;t heard too much about these devices since, but there was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1878470166360580199">a leak earlier</a> this year that suggested ASUS would be the first to launch, and that it would include face and eye tracking features.</p>
<div id="269f1b00ffef4fafb3f5260230afab35"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Details on the upcoming ASUS ROG VR headset running Meta Horizon OS.<br><br>It is codenamed Tarius, and will likely be one of the first 3P Horizon OS HMDs to ship.<br><br>It is planned to include Eye Tracking and Face Tracking.

<p>Another intriguing possibility is an update on Meta&#39;s holographic Codec avatars we got <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:20;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-holographic-avatars-will-eventually-be-in-vr-too-235206805.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc">a glimpse</a> of last year. While Meta&#39;s current lineup of VR headsets don&#39;t have the necessary face and eye-tracking sensors to support the tech, <em>UploadVR</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-cto-teases-what-to-expect-at-connect-2025/">suggests</a> Meta could show off a more &quot;rudimentary&quot; version of the avatars that could run on the Quest 3 or even work in conjunction with video calls on WhatsApp and Messenger.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A regulator has accused NVIDIA of violating China&#39;s antitrust laws over its acquisition of chipmaker Mellanox. In its preliminary findings of an investigation it commenced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/chinese-regulators-are-investigating-nvidia-for-potential-antitrust-violations-200136726.html"><ins>in December</ins></a>, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) claimed that the company breached both national regulations and the conditional terms China outlined when it rubberstamped the $6.9 billion takeover. The SAMR hasn&#39;t announced any penalties yet, as the investigation will continue.</p>
<p>The SAMR is said to have determined its preliminary findings several weeks ago. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa7a2e35-df03-45a1-bd0b-3f7207a7d84b"><em><ins>Financial Post</ins></em></a> sources, the regulator held off from releasing its statement until now, as trade talks with the US take place in Madrid, with the idea of giving Chinese officials more leverage. (Those talks have so far resulted in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tiktok-deal-may-finally-be-happening-160448732.html"><ins>a framework agreement for TikTok</ins></a>.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NVIDIA and Mellanox <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-11-nvidia-acquisition-mellanox.html"><ins>announced the buyout</ins></a> back in 2019. China approved it in April the following year on the condition that NVIDIA continued to supply GPUs and interconnect products to the country and adhere to “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory principles,” per the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3325595/tech-war-china-finds-us-chip-giant-nvidia-violated-anti-monopoly-law"><em><ins>South China Morning Post</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Last month, it was reported that China was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html">discouraging</a> companies in the country from buying NVIDIA&#39;s H20 chips pending a national security review. Officials were said to have taken offense at remarks from Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary. After the US allowed NVIDIA to start offering chips to China again in July following a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-says-it-can-resume-selling-key-ai-chips-to-china-120015817.html"><ins>three-month ban</ins></a>, Lutnick said the company wasn&#39;t going to be selling its most cutting-edge tech there.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it,&quot; he told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/howard-lutnick-says-china-is-only-getting-nvidias-4th-best-ai-chip.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. &quot;The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-says-nvidias-mellanox-acquisition-violated-antitrust-law-200409929.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, New York joined the wave of states passing legislation aimed at protecting minors using the Internet, particularly social media. Governor Kathy Hochul <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-governor-signs-two-new-bills-into-law-protecting-kids-from-social-media-211935749.html"><ins>signed</ins></a> the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act and the New York Child Data Protection Act in June 2024. Today, the state&#39;s Attorney General Letitia James released more <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-releases-proposed-rules-safe-kids-act-restrict-addictive">specifics</a> about what the SAFE for Kids Act will entail in practice. Public comment is open until December 1 and the rules must be finalized within a year from that date.</p>
<p>In particular, the rule will require online platforms to confirm the ages of users before showing them algorithmically-curated feeds or sending them notifications at night. The Attorney General&#39;s approach allows sites to choose their method of age verification, as long as the approach &quot;are shown to be effective and protect users’ data.&quot; New York will also require an age confirmation method that does not rely on having a government-issued ID.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There is also a component of parental consent in the SAFE for Kids Act. Minors must request a social media network to seek parental permission for accessing algorithmic feeds or receiving nighttime notifications. If parental consent is not granted, the platforms may not block minors from generally accessing their service or content. Both the minor and their parent may revoke their consent at any time.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposed rules released by my office today will help us tackle the youth mental health crisis and make social media safer for kids and families,&quot; James said in the announcement. &quot;This is an issue that affects all of us, and I encourage parents, educators, young people, industry groups, and others to review the proposed rules and submit a comment during the public comment period.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/new-york-details-its-plans-for-online-age-verification-rules-195223379.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has apparently updated its Steam Early Access policy to no longer accept games with what the company deems to be &quot;mature themes.&quot; As first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/business/pressure-continues-steam-denies-early-access-release-for-adult-games-ed57cc6bd4b4e60ee9663c5f90a1b797"><em><ins>Gamesmarkt</ins></em></a> earlier this month, gaming studio Dammitbird, which develops the adult adventure game <em>Heavy Hearts</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/GalewindG/status/1961949585254826238">was not allowed</a> to put the title on Steam Early Access because of its content.</p>
<p>Payment processors like Mastercard and Visa have been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html"><ins>mounting a pressure campaign</ins></a> on video game marketplaces Steam and Itch.io to remove certain adults-only content since early summer. After <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.newsweek.com/no-mercy-game-us-2058679"><ins>taking down</ins></a> a game called <em>No Mercy</em> in April at the behest of payment processors and an <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-and-stolen-puritanical-valor-234220878.html"><ins>Australian anti-porn organization</ins></a>, there has been a steady expansion in the application of these new policies.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Steam, for its part, made some incredibly vague policy changes to appease the payment giants, adding a sweeping clause that promises to ban certain kinds of adults-only content before <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html"><ins>proceeding to remove</ins></a> hundreds of games. Itch.io made <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq"><ins>similar changes</ins></a> before <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html"><ins>removing more than 20,000 titles</ins></a> from its marketplace. Steam has removed hundreds of titles that we know of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparent scope creep is of particular concern to small independent developers whose fairly innocuous games <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html"><ins>like </ins><em><ins>VILE: Exhumed</ins></em></a> were banned from Steam and delisted from Itch.io. <em>Exhumed</em> is a mostly text-based game whose limited imagery and innuendo is worlds away from the sort of adult games that were first banned when this whole saga kicked off.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is how card payments are policed. Stores like Steam and Itch.io don’t contract with Visa or Mastercard directly but with acquiring banks and processors that must enforce the card networks’ brand-safety and anti-trafficking rules. This can end up influencing how <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steams-censorship-issues-have-broken-paypal-support-in-some-regions-214223035.html"><ins>companies like PayPal</ins></a> work with Steam across different regions, depending on how banks in those areas are responding to the pressure exerted by Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>The confusion will continue to cause consternation among developers and consumers alike until policies on these platforms are made clearer, or payment processors relieve some of the pressure by clarifying their own standards.</p>
<p>Engadget has reached out to Valve for comment and will update if we hear back.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/early-access-is-the-latest-place-where-steam-is-restricting-games-with-mature-themes-190806818.html?src=rss]]></description>

The xboom Buds Plus and Buds Lite (which seems like a relatively confusing name to beer drinkers) both hit store shelves sometime this month.</p>
<p>The Buds Plus earbuds are filled with high-tech bells and whistles. These premium headphones boast adaptive EQ that continuously adjusts the sound profile in real time. This should ensure &quot;optimal audio quality regardless of how the earbuds are worn.&quot; The company says the design compensates for changes that would lead to signal degradation with other earbuds.</p>

<p>They include ANC and a trio of microphones for making phone calls and the like. The charging case sanitizes the earbuds after each use with UV rays, with the company claiming that the process eliminates 99.9 percent of bacteria from the surface. This case also doubles as a Bluetooth transmitter, which is useful when enjoying some in-flight entertainment. It supports wireless charging, which is nice, with up to ten hours of playback per charge on the buds and 30 hours with the case.</p>
<p>The Buds Lite earbuds have one advantage over the standard Buds and the Buds Plus. The battery lasts up to 11.5 hours per charge, with the case bringing that up to 35 hours. Otherwise, these are standard earbuds that offer &quot;clear, balanced audio for music, calls and more.&quot;</p>
<p>They offer ANC, though a more streamlined version than with the Plus, and four customizable EQ modes. This allows users to &quot;fine-tune their sound profile to match their preferences.&quot; The Buds Lite ship with several different ear tips to accommodate multiple ear canal sizes.</p>

<p>LG hasn&#39;t revealed any pricing info on these products, but the original xboom Buds cost $109. It&#39;s a safe bet the Buds Plus will cost more than that. Hopefully, the Buds Lite will cost a bit less.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a summer of beta updates, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">iOS 26</a> is here.

Head to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>, and get ready for a Liquid Glass makeover.</p>
<p>iOS 26 offers <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">Apple&#39;s biggest visual change to its software</a> since iOS 7. (That was when Jony Ive&#39;s flat design replaced Scott Forstall&#39;s skeuomorphic one.) This time around, the software adopts a translucent material theme: Liquid Glass. Although it isn&#39;t a return to skeuomorphism, it does reincorporate a sense of depth, simulating a pleasantly refractive glass. Expect colors and visual effects that respond to their onscreen surroundings.</p>

<p>Apple has taken flak from industry pundits for not rushing headfirst into AI. (Or, at least it hasn&#39;t with the same manic frenzy as <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-recap-ai-updates-android-xr-google-beam-and-everything-else-announced-at-the-annual-keynote-175900229.html">its competitors</a>.) The company is taking a more measured approach, gradually incorporating it into its software. This year&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-intelligence-announcements-at-wwdc-everything-apple-revealed-for-ios-macos-and-more-171133645.html">Apple Intelligence additions</a> include live translation in messages, FaceTime and Phone. Visual Intelligence also expands beyond the camera and into screenshots. And your Genmoji and Image Playground creations might look less… strange than last year&#39;s versions.</p>
<p>Even Apple Music gets a new AI feature. Its new automix generates transitions between songs, aiming for DJ-like progressions. I find that it works best with danceable genres like EDM or hip-hop. It usually won&#39;t bother trying to mix less beat-driven singer-songwriter-type stuff.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/816a71a0-8ffd-11f0-bec3-dcf91c4b8d91" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/816a71a0-8ffd-11f0-bec3-dcf91c4b8d91" style="height:528px;width:938px;" alt="Screenshot of live translation in iOS 26 messages." data-uuid="05eb9c82-173a-34d4-9128-a46438bc4a25"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure>
<p>Arguably handier than new AI features is Apple&#39;s revamp of its communication apps. Call screening lets you gather info from callers before deciding whether to pick up. Hold Assist saves you from having to listen to the Muzak. And the Messages app adds new screening options and filters. You can also add custom backgrounds and even conduct polls in your messaging threads. Finally, the Phone app cleans up its interface, unifying its tabs into a single list.</p>

<p>There are two front-facing USB-C ports, which is extremely handy. The back of the computer boasts even more ports, including Thunderbolt, HDMI and Ethernet. As indicated by the name, this thing features the speedy M4 chip. The processor can easily handle garden variety computing tasks, like watching content, but also excels with creative pursuits like making music and editing videos.</p> 
<p>This desktop doesn't include an SD card reader, which could be a dealbreaker for those looking for an easy way to add more storage. We also found that the fan got loud every once in a while when dealing with heavy workloads. Otherwise, this is a near-perfect (and adorable) computer.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-reach-framework-deal-tiktok-trump-xi-speak-friday-2025-09-15/"><ins>has said</ins></a> that the United States and China have reached a framework deal on TikTok. Speaking to reporters in Madrid after two days of talks with his Chinese counterparts, Bessent said, “It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” President Trump said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://wordtohtml.net/These%20comments%20come%20ahead%20of%20planned%20conversations%20between%20President%20Trump%20and%20Xi%20Jinping,%20expected%20to%20be%20held%20on%20Friday."><ins>Truth Social post</ins></a> that he will be speaking with Xi Jinping this Friday regarding the potential deal, among other things.</p>
<p>This breakthrough comes after the Trump administration extended the TikTok ban for a third time earlier this summer, giving the company until September 17 to undergo a sale or face a ban in the United States. The short-form video content app faced increasing scrutiny over national security concerns due to the Chinese ownership of its parent company, ByteDance.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>President Trump issued an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-tiktok-us-microsoft-190552645.html"><ins>executive order</ins></a> in August 2020 banning the app in the United States unless it was divested from ByteDance, though <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/07/944039053/u-s-judge-halts-trumps-tiktok-ban-the-2nd-court-to-fully-block-the-action"><ins>courts halted</ins></a> enforcement of the order. In 2024 the United States Congress passed the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521"><ins>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA)</ins></a> which was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html"><ins>signed into law</ins></a> by then-President Biden. The Trump administration has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of that law in hopes a deal could be made for a US-based acquisition, leaving the app online in the meantime.</p>
<p>As it stands, this appears to be a framework for how TikTok could come under some level of US control, and not a signed final deal. Companies from <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-denies-talks-with-oracle-about-a-tiktok-deal-but-says-a-decision-will-likely-be-made-within-30-days-163755199.html"><ins>Oracle</ins></a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/what-will-happen-to-tiktok-a-look-at-the-potential-buyers-000110723.html"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, and the president is <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-tiktok-us-microsoft-190552645.html"><ins>on record</ins></a> as saying he would be OK if a &quot;very American company&quot; buys it. It&#39;s unclear if the September 17 deadline will be pushed once again, but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that another delay may be needed in order to get the deal signed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/a-tiktok-deal-may-finally-be-happening-160448732.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-wireless-earbuds">What to look for in the best wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">AirPods</a> or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.</p> 
<p>For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.</p> 
<p>When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.</p> 
<p>Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.</p> 
<p>We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/indie-labels-say-apple-musics-spatial-audio-royalties-only-benefit-the-biggest-player-211730447.html">Spatial Audio</a>, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-wireless-earbuds">How we test wireless earbuds</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).</p> 
<p>To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-we-tested">Other wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wf-c710n">Sony WF-C710N</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-c710n-review-more-than-midrange-180018400.html">WF-C710N</a> is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-powerbeats-pro-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</h3> 
<p>The newest version of the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-samsung-galaxy-buds-3">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-and-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review-airpods-clones-that-actually-deliver-171024116.html">Galaxy Buds 3</a> combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sennheiser-momentum-sport">Sennheiser Momentum Sport</h3> 
<p>I really like the overall shape of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review-fitness-earbuds-that-lack-finesse-130036233.html">Momentum Sport</a> earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-solo-buds">Beats Solo Buds</h3> 
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-solo-buds-review-exactly-what-youd-expect-for-80-170742296.html">Solo Buds</a> for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-ultra-open-earbuds">Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</h3> 
<p>Bose created something very unique for <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">this set of earbuds</a> that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-audio-technica-ath-twx7">Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-twx7-review-good-earbuds-with-frustrating-flaws-160054450.html">These stick buds</a> have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mw09">Master &amp; Dynamic MW09</h3> 
<p>Retooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master--dynamic-mw09-review-premium-materials-impeccable-clarity-132522028.html">MW09</a> has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-earbud-faqs">Wireless earbud FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-considered-good-battery-life-for-true-wireless-earbuds">What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Most wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-sound-quality-better-on-headphones-or-earbuds">Is sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?</h3> 
<p>Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3</a> is also outstanding.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-wireless-earbuds-have-the-longest-battery-life">Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?</h3> 
<p>With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-audio-technica-ath-cks5tw-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW</a>. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08</a> offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-are-waterproof">What wireless earbuds are waterproof?</h3> 
<p>There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-earbuds-stay-in-ears-the-best">Which earbuds stay in ears the best?</h3> 
<p>A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-wireless-earbuds-work-with-ps5">What wireless earbuds work with PS5?</h3> 
<p>PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-inzone-gaming-monitors-headsets-specs-pricing-availability-210056794.html">Sony’s own gaming headsets</a> come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has a press event scheduled for September 30 at 10AM ET. Panos Panay, who leads the company&#39;s Devices &amp; Services team, will be on hand. This strongly suggests that Amazon will announce some new hardware.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t exactly know what the company will reveal, but we do have a giant clue. The press invite also included a composite image of various Amazon devices. These appear to include a Kindle ereader, a Fire TV of some kind and an Echo speaker. Those are three of the company&#39;s biggest product categories.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve gotten a new entry-level Kindle, though Amazon did recently refresh both the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html"><ins>Scribe</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html"><ins>Colorsoft</ins></a>. It&#39;s also possible the company will announce a refresh of the Paperwhite ereader.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a similar story with Echo speakers. The company recently refreshed the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html"><ins>Echo Dot</ins></a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-unveils-the-40-echo-pop-a-semi-spherical-smart-speaker-140026706.html"><ins>Echo Pop</ins></a>, along with the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/echo-show-8-3rd-gen-hands-on-174000825.html"><ins>Echo Show 8</ins></a>, but it&#39;s been nearly five years since it redesigned the standard Echo speaker. It&#39;s possible the company&#39;s speakers will be getting some kind of new integration with the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html"><ins>Alexa+ smart assistant</ins></a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a couple of years since we&#39;ve gotten a big influx of new Fire TVs and related streaming sticks, so those could also be on the docket. However, that part of the invite image is a bit fuzzy and might be advertising an upcoming tablet and not new TVs. In any event, we only have a couple of weeks before finding out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-may-be-announcing-new-echo-and-kindle-devices-on-september-30-152044048.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html">Awe Dropping event</a> started with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKphYoxGeRE">dramatic health testimonials</a> from Apple Watch users, then revealed a key new feature for the new Watch Series 11: hypertension alerts. The function had yet to receive FDA clearance at the time, but that has now been granted, as first reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/apple-watch-hypertension-detection-coming-next-week-after-fda-nod"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and confirmed by Apple. As a result, it will reportedly be available to users in 150 countries when the Watch 11 and Ultra Watch 3 ship starting on September 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypertension alerts can help detect hypertension (high blood pressure), a potentially dangerous condition that affects over a billion people. The feature relies on the Watch&#39;s optical heart sensor, but now uses new machine learning algorithm that also draws from a study involving more than 100,000 participants to look for high blood pressure. It works in the background a month-long period to seek patterns associated with hypertension. Unlike devices that <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shop.yhetechs.com/products/bp-doctor-fit">measure your specific blood pressure</a>, it only tells users that there may be a danger.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Last year, Apple received FDA clearance for its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apples-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-will-work-on-airpods-pro-154814439.html">over-the-counter Hearing Aid function</a> that transforms the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">second-gen AirPods Pro</a> into OTC hearing aids for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Another recently approved feature is <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-brings-sleep-apnea-detection-to-the-watch-series-10-172316987.html">sleep apnea detection</a>. However, the company is currently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html">facing a lawsuit</a> over the Apple Watch&#39;s redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Correction, September 15, 2025, 10:27AM ET:</strong> This article and its headline originally stated that the Apple Watch received FDA approval for the new hypertension alerts feature. It received FDA clearance, which is a lower level of authorization compared to FDA approval. We apologize for this error.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-11-receives-fda-clearance-for-hypertension-alerts-120046138.html?src=rss]]></description>
