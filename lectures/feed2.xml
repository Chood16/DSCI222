                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Nothing Phone universe continues to expand. On Wednesday, the company launched the fourth model in the Phone 3 lineup: the Nothing Phone 3a Lite. The cheapest model in the series, the Phone 3a Lite pairs the brand&#39;s distinct styling with solid all-around specs for an entry-level handset. However, with the company saying its non-flagship devices will soon include pre-installed apps and lock-screen ads, there may be a trade-off.</p>
<p>First, Nothing told Engadget that the phone won&#39;t come to the US. So, Americans only have the previous trio of third-gen handsets to choose from. That&#39;s the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3-review-143006151.html">Nothing Phone 3</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html">Nothing Phone 3a, and Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Lite uses a Panda Glass casing over an aluminum internal frame. As you can see, it retains some familiar design strokes, albeit pared down to match its €249 price. As the company describes it, the handset&#39;s &quot;asymmetric, transparent look and nano-coating creates a beautiful balance of matte and gloss.&quot; (Poetry!) The phone ships in white and black variants. Whether Nothing&#39;s design language is your cup of tea or not, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a more striking and bold design language in a budget model.</p>
<p>The handset includes the Essential Key, a multi-purpose physical button <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review-rising-above-the-boring-competition-120014496.html">found on all Phone 3 series models</a>. The phone is IP54-rated for dust and water resistance.</p>

<p>Nothing honors the brand&#39;s unique Glyph system (while keeping costs down) by using a notification LED. (Remember those on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-12-htc-one-review.html">early Android phones</a>?) This model&#39;s &quot;Glyph Light&quot; supports the lineup&#39;s Flip to Glyph feature, which switches to light-only alerts when the device is face down. The LED can stay on for &quot;key contact and app notifications&quot; and serve as a camera countdown timer. You can also customize its light sequences for calls and specific contacts.</p>
<p>The handset has a hearty 5,000 mAh battery. Nothing advertises 22 hours of YouTube playback or 9.5 hours of gaming. It supports 33W fast charging, reaching 50 percent in about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The Phone 3a Lite has a triple-camera system. That includes a 50MP primary camera with a 1/1.57-inch Samsung sensor. Joining it are an 8MP ultra-wide and a macro lens. The rear camera system shoots 4K video at app to 30 FPS. On its front is a 16MP lens.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Lite has more than respectable display specs for a budget phone. It uses a 6.77-inch flexible AMOLED panel with 1,080 x 2,392 resolution (387 PPI). It has a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a 1,000Hz touch sampling rate. It can reach 3,000 nits peak HDR brightness and 1,300 nits outdoor brightness.</p>
<p>The handset&#39;s processor is the 4nm MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G. The 8-core CPU can reach up to 2.5 GHz. Nothing says the chip performs better than the MediaTek 7200 silicon in last year&#39;s Phone 2a. The company claims its CPU is 15 percent faster, its GPU supports 20 percent higher FPS, and its NPU delivers 100 percent better AI performance.</p>
<p>The phone also uses a liquid-cooling system, which may help during intensive gaming sessions. It ships with 8GB of RAM and comes in 128GB and 256GB storage tiers.</p>

<p>The phone runs the Nothing OS 3.5 UI on top of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/android-15-is-now-here-a-month-later-than-expected-180045026.html">Android 15</a>. The company says Nothing OS 4.0 will arrive in the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>And that brings us back to those trade-offs. Earlier this week, Nothing confirmed to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/27/nothing-phone-pre-installed-apps-lock-screen-ads-phone-3a-lite-teaser/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> that its strategy moving forward will include &quot;Lock Glimpse.&quot; This rotating lock-screen wallpaper feature includes text with links to external content hosted by a Chinese advertising company. (That firm, Boyuan, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.boyuanhulian.com/index.html">says</a> it offers a &quot;rich mixture of content&quot; to help its partners &quot;commercialize the mobile traffic.&quot;) Think of it as a slightly less obnoxious version of lock-screen ads.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lock Glimpse is off by default in the current Nothing OS 4.0 beta. Nothing <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/45348-nothing-os-40-beta-on-phone-3a-series-lock-glimpse-future-plans">pledges</a> it will give users &quot;full control over features like Lock Glimpse.&quot; However, that promise doesn&#39;t explicitly say the feature will remain off by default.</p>
<p>Another cost-subsidizing move is Nothing&#39;s (also confirmed) embrace of pre-installed apps. The company said its &quot;carefully considered&quot; third-party apps are those &quot;most people install on day one, like Instagram.&quot; In fairness, that&#39;s a common practice among Android phone manufacturers. And Nothing says it will make third-party apps removable.</p>
<p>But again, the concessions here arguably run counter to one aspect of the brand&#39;s stated ethos: clean, bloat-free software. And if business considerations forced compromises in this area, it makes you question how long Lock Glimpse will stay off by default.</p>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Lite is available now in Europe on the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://nothing.tech/">company website</a>. The 128GB model costs €249 (EU) / £249 (UK). Meanwhile, the 256GB model will set you back €279 (EU) / £279 (UK).</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029193778/en/Nintendo-and-Laced-Records-Announce-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Vinyl-Soundtrack-Collection"><ins>is teaming up with Laced Records</ins></a> on a couple of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> vinyl soundtrack releases, which is pretty darned cool. There&#39;s even a massive 8-LP box set that ships with some franchise-friendly bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with that box set. It&#39;s available in limited-edition colored vinyl or standard black vinyl. At eight vinyl records, it probably includes just about every piano twinkle and wind rustle found throughout the game. All told, there are 130 newly remastered tracks.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The records here are split into themes, mirroring a player&#39;s progression through Hyrule. These themes &quot;revolve around exploring the Kingdom of Hyrule, freeing the Divine Beasts from Calamity Ganon&#39;s hold and discovering the mysteries of the Shrines.&quot;</p>
<p>It ships with a nifty-looking collector&#39;s case and comes with 16 art prints depicting various scenes from the game. The 8-LP collection costs $195, which is high but not the worst deal in the world. That breaks down to around $24 per record.</p>

<p>The double-LP collection is a more standard affair, with 34 tracks pulled from throughout the game. These include musical cues from visiting the Great Fairy Fountain, Hyrule Castle and other locations. This one costs $50 and is also available in both black and colored vinyl.</p>
<p>Both collections are available to pre-order right now via Laced Records and My Nintendo Store. They won&#39;t be shipped until June 19, 2026.</p>
<p>This is one of the first major Nintendo game soundtracks available in a physical format outside of Japan. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is an interesting choice here for an initial vinyl release, given that the game&#39;s soundtrack is known for mood-setting vibes but not really known for bops.</p>

At the time, there weren&#39;t too many titles in that genre popping up. However, he noted that &quot;we&#39;re evolving out of the MMOs&quot; into other genres, hinting then that the division was changing focus.

It reportedly plans to keep releasing “casual and AI-focused games&quot; for Luna, such as <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em>, which puts an AI-generated version of the rapper in a Judge Judy-type role for court case-style debates between players.

It typically costs $100, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=you+can+get+12+months+of+access+for+%2450+with+this+code.&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code.</a></p> 
<p>There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can&#39;t be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can&#39;t redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you&#39;ll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you&#39;ve set. There&#39;s also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what&#39;s been happening with your money that month. You&#39;ll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it&#39;s a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven&#39;t yet found a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint replacement</a>.

<h2 id="jump-link-can-i-pause-my-subscription">Can I pause my subscription?</h2>
<p>No, there&#39;s no option as of yet to pause your Paramount+ subscription. If you want to cancel it then just do so and rejoin when the time is right — or a better deal is available.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-happens-after-you-cancel">What happens after you cancel&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The good news is that your subscription won&#39;t end immediately. If you&#39;re in a free trial then your access to Paramount+ will remain until the trial period ends. Similarly, paid subscribers will lose the ability to use Paramount+ at the end of the current billing period. Notably, if you&#39;ve used a multi-month promotion, your subscription will still stop at the end of your current billing period.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-your-paramount-subscription-140053714.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I vividly remember testing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-echo-studio-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">the first Echo Studio</a>. Even though that was nearly six years ago, I can clearly recall my surprise that Amazon had finally built a smart speaker that actually sounded good. It certainly helped that Amazon created a device that appropriately broadcasted spatial audio, and one that offered a boost to movies in the living room (if you bought a pair of them).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was similarly surprised to see the overhauled Echo Studio when Amazon revealed it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-reveals-an-updated-echo-studio-speaker-with-a-new-chip-and-upgraded-drivers-150303898.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a few weeks ago</a>. Could the company offer the same audio performance in a speaker that was 40 percent smaller? The <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DMQ1QMVV&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fe8d4457-ba79-4145-9004-e2b55db1fe9b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=2025+Echo+Studio+%28%24220%29&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRE1RMVFNVlY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmU4ZDQ0NTctYmE3OS00MTQ1LTkwMDQtZTJiNTVkYjFmZTliIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRE1RMVFNVlYiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7-UVByKDZPxof7x63wBleXEgzOIiRErahuw4EDMa3L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DMQ1QMVV" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMQ1QMVV">2025 Echo Studio ($220)</a> combines three 1.5-inch full-range drivers with a 3.75-inch woofer in a very confined space, all powered by the company’s new AI-ready processor. There’s certainly a lot to like about the comprehensive reboot of the Studio after such a long time, but for now, there are also several caveats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 <core-commerce data-type="product-list" id="3ee14d90-338c-4d7a-ad20-fcb1a6056ab6" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMQ1QMVV?th=1"></core-commerce></p>
<h2 id="ef6dc94b-4f8c-478f-adf4-28bbeaae340e">What’s good about the Echo Studio?</h2>
<p>Amazon completely redesigned the Echo Studio, opting for a much more compact, spherical look compared to the previous large cylinder. To me, this is an upgrade; it looks less like a speaker and more like a piece of home decor. Amazon also moved the trademark light ring to the front, the element that illuminates when you’re talking to Alexa, so it’s easier to see when you’re directly facing the speaker. The lights will also display volume level in white when you make an adjustment, flash red if you mute the microphones and show blue for Bluetooth pairing mode. If you employ the Drop In feature, the Echo’s intercom of sorts, the ring glows green while you check in on what’s happening in the room from somewhere else.</p>
<p>The company also relocated all of the controls. The volume and mute buttons that used to be on top are now on an angled panel on the front, offering satisfying travel when you press them. And those are the only three buttons you get on the Echo Studio, as Amazon wants you to use noice commands for everything else when playing music or podcasts. Or, you know, you could reach for your phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are optional tap controls that can be used to snooze alarms, stop timers and end both calls and Drop Ins. You simply tap the top of the Echo Studio for this. What’s more, you can enable “advanced” tap control that allows you to play/pause media with the same action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon promises &quot;powerful bass and crystal-clear vocals&quot; on the new Echo Studio, and I&#39;d say the latter holds true. There is great clarity in the sound here, and the tuning definitely favors highs and mids across nearly every genre. For example, the synths and vocals on the <em>TRON: Ares </em>soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails are more prominent than the drum machines or bass line. Still, I heard an immersive quality to these songs, but not as much as I&#39;ve noticed using headphones or earbuds. There&#39;s more low-end tone on Thrice&#39;s <em>Horizons/West</em>, and overall, the instruments offer a more enveloping quality than most other albums I tested. Just know there&#39;s quite a bit of variation from album to album and genre to genre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the original Echo Studio, this model supports spatial audio, Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio content. Those are available from various streaming platforms, including Amazon Music Unlimited. Amazon only sent me one of the new speakers, so it’s tough to evaluate immersive Atmos sound here, but I gave it my best shot. The Echo Studio performs slightly better with Dolby Atmos tunes from Amazon Music as those songs have more depth and a wider soundstage. However, the bass is still quite muted, so even the spatial audio and Ultra HD quality boost don’t rescue the sluggish low-end tone and prominent vocals.</p>

<p>The new Echo Studio comes with early access to Alexa+, Amazon’s next-gen virtual assistant. The company has spent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-is-evolving-into-a-chatbot-for-your-home-152654742.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">the last few years</a> overhauling its companion, and my colleague Cherlynn Low has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-preview-an-almost-philosophical-exercise-130012573.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">an in-depth preview</a> of what you can expect when you’re able to use it. I’ve been chatting with the new Alexa for about a week during the course of testing this speaker, and to my surprise, this AI-powered assistant is indeed much improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest change I’ve noticed is in on-going conversations with multiple follow-up questions or comments. The new AZ3 Pro chip inside the Echo Studio certainly helps keep things snappy, so there are no awkward pauses. I asked Alexa+ to remind me to make pizza dough one afternoon, and it confirmed the request without hesitation. Taking a cue from Cherlynn, I then asked about my mood right after, to which Alexa replied that I seemed to be chill based on my voice — a good “Monday vibe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except it wasn’t Monday, it was Tuesday. When I corrected Alexa, the assistant played it cool, thanking me for helping and apologizing for the mistake. It then recalled the initial pizza request, commenting that it seemed like I was on top of things that day, including my dough recipe and the task at hand. It was the most human-to-human interaction I’ve ever had with a virtual assistant, and it felt like the promise of casual conversations with technology like this was finally fulfilled. And, I have to say, it kind of freaked me out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My week–long fling hasn’t been without a few bumps though. Despite the Echo Studio having a built-in temperature sensor, Alexa+ can’t pull data from it. When you ask about the temperature in your house, the assistant checks for a connected thermostat, which I don’t have synced with the Alexa app. There are still times like this where you’ll run into some head-scratching limitations, but overall, the new Alexa is more human-like than ever when you interact with it. And again, at times, it’s pretty unsettling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the early access period is over, you’ll need a Prime membership to continue using Alexa+ for free. If you don’t have one, the next-gen assistant will cost you a whopping $20/month. And right now, the preview is only available in the US and in US English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the clarity and somewhat immersive audio performance on the Echo Studio is a highlight, the lack of detail in the bass tuning is a hindrance most of the time. There is noticeable bass when a song calls for it, but the low-end tone has a muted, almost muffled quality that’s missing nuance. This makes songs like Water From Your Eyes’ “Born 2” sound much flatter and constrained than I’ve heard on the second-gen Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and AirPods Pro 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon spent time during its recent launch event talking about <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-will-let-you-use-amazons-echo-speakers-for-surround-sound-153325469.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Alexa Home Theater</a>, a feature that will allow you to combine up to five Echo Studio speakers (or Echo Dot Max) with a compatible Fire TV stick. The company promises that all you have to do is plug in your gear and Alexa will handle the setup and tuning for you automatically. Unfortunately, Alexa Home Theater isn’t available yet;&nbsp; the company says it will be released “in the coming weeks.” Of course, this means I wasn’t able to test it, which leaves one of the Echo Studio’s best features — at least on paper — for future evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company also nixed the 3.5mm input from the original Echo Studio. While I can appreciate that it was a much larger speaker, and 2019 was an entirely different time, I did like that Amazon gave us the option for wired connectivity on that device. With this new model, you’re left with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Despite enabling tap controls in the Echo Studio settings in the Alexa app, I could only get a few of them to work (snooze alarms, dismiss timers, end calls and stop Drop In). I even made sure to stand right in front of the speaker so its proximity sensors would know I was there, tapping awkwardly on the 3D knit fabric. Obviously, this doesn’t block any of the speaker’s functions as you can just use your voice for all of it. However, the ability to at least play/pause directly on the speaker would be handy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second iteration of the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DMQ1QMVV&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fe8d4457-ba79-4145-9004-e2b55db1fe9b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Echo+Studio&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRE1RMVFNVlY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmU4ZDQ0NTctYmE3OS00MTQ1LTkwMDQtZTJiNTVkYjFmZTliIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRE1RMVFNVlYiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7-UVByKDZPxof7x63wBleXEgzOIiRErahuw4EDMa3L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DMQ1QMVV" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMQ1QMVV">Echo Studio</a> is a refined smart speaker that’s purpose-built for Amazon’s next-gen AI voice assistant. The device is a nice home for Alexa+ and the new design is certainly an improvement over the 2019 aesthetic of the original. While there’s some aspects of the sound on the Echo Studio that I admire, the tuning doesn’t offer the comprehensive oomph of that first speaker. That’s mostly due to the lack of detail in the bass, despite a pleasingly immersive soundstage overall. One of the speaker’s main features is still on the way, and the tap controls need fine-tuning, so for now, the new Echo Studio has a considerable amount of unfulfilled potential. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html?src=rss]]></description>

Having a portable battery that can stay on your person without weighing you down is crucial for the busiest among us.

<p>As you can probably guess from its name, Baseus’ power bank has a 5,000mAh capacity and is Qi2-certified. In our testing. It gave our tester iPhone 15 a 43 percent bump in battery in 42 minutes, which returned the phone to 91 percent. It has a curved design and is wrapped in soft silicone, making it easy to grip in a pinch.</p> 
<p>As a reminder, MagSafe charging is supported on iPhone 12 models and later, though you’ll need an iPhone 13 or later to reach the 15W charging speed on a third-party Qi2 accessory such as the one featured in this deal.

The expansion is called <em>Ante Chamber</em> and includes a new stage, new characters and a new power ups that makes the top-down rogue shooter feel more like, well, <em>Balatro</em>.</p><p>First up, the titular Ante Chamber stage is filled with playing cards, calling to mind the source material. The new characters include the iconic joker Jimbo and there are new power-ups and weapons pulled from <em>Balatro</em>. These include jokers that increase points combos, just like the card game, and riffs on pre-existing <em>Balatro</em> mechanics like those planet cards. It looks fun.</p><div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB0begpTOdQ?si=lazOlxiHtPtkLD50" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The <em>Ante Chamber</em> update is free and available to download now via Steam, Android, iOS, PS4 and PS5. It&#39;s coming to the Switch and Epic Games Store on October 31. </p><p>Although the trailer suggested the update was out on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on Tuesday as well, that wasn’t the case. “Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t manage to deliver the 1.14 update on time for Xbox platforms yesterday,”  Poncle <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/imrankhan.bsky.social/post/3m4dir5gjrs2y" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">said in a statement</a> on Wednesday. “We&#39;re very sorry to our Xbox players who were looking forward to playing the update. We&#39;ve submitted new builds to be certified, and the new plan is to launch the Xbox updates as soon as they&#39;re ready. Thank you for your patience. We aim to get the update to you as soon as possible.” That’s somewhat ironic, given the <em>Balatro </em>collaboration was revealed during an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/28/id-xbox-showcase-october-2025-everything-announced-recap/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Xbox indie showcase</a>.</p><p>This free update is more than just a <em>Balatro</em>-adjacent expansion. It also introduces online co-op (but not yet on mobile, unfortunately), in addition to new stages, characters, weapons and more.</p><p><strong>Update, October 29, 9:23AM ET:</strong> Added clarification about the <em>Ante Chamber </em>update for Xbox consoles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/balatro-comes-to-vampire-survivors-in-the-form-of-a-free-expansion-183005013.html?src=rss]]></description>

It&#39;s easy to set up and it integrates neatly into the Alexa smart home ecosystem. While you need a Blink Subscription for cloud storage ($3 for one camera, $10 for as many as you like), you can pick up a Sync Module 2 or Sync Module XR to store Blink Mini 2 footage locally. A Blink Subscription also enables specialized detection and alerts (e.g. for people and pets) and features like periodic photo captures.</p> 
<p>The Blink Mini 2 is weather resistant, though you&#39;ll need an adapter to use it outdoors. Additionally, you can use the Mini 2 as a plug-in chime that sounds when someone presses a Blink Video Doorbell.</p> 
<p>A number of other Blink cameras and bundles are on sale at the moment.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>US lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have introduced a bill called the &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-bipartisan-bill-protecting-children-from-ai-chatbots-with-parents-colleagues/">GUARD Act</a>,&quot; which is meant to protect minor users from AI chatbots. &quot;In their race to the bottom, AI companies are pushing treacherous chatbots at kids and looking away when their products cause sexual abuse, or coerce them into self-harm or suicide,&quot; said the bill&#39;s co-sponsor, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn). &quot;Our legislation imposes strict safeguards against exploitative or manipulative AI, backed by tough enforcement with criminal and civil penalties.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the GUARD Act, AI companies would be required to prohibit minors from being able to access their chatbots. That means they have to conduct age verification for both existing and new users with the help of a third-party system. They&#39;ll also have to conduct periodic age verifications on accounts that were already previously verified. To maintain users&#39; privacy, the companies will only be allowed to retain data &quot;for no longer than is reasonably necessary to verify a user&#39;s age&quot; and may not share or sell user information.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>AI companies will be required to make their chatbots explicitly tell the user that it&#39;s not a human being at the beginning of each conversation and every 30 minutes after that. They&#39;ll have to make sure their chatbots don&#39;t claim to be a human being or a licensed professional, such a therapist or a doctor, when asked. Finally, the bill aims to create new crimes to charge companies that make their AI chatbots available to minors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August, the parents of a teen who committed suicide <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html">filed a wrongful death lawsuit</a> against OpenAI, accusing it of prioritizing &quot;engagement over safety.&quot; ChatGPT, they said, helped their son plan his own death even after months of conversations, wherein their child talked to the chatbot about his four previous suicide attempts. ChatGPT allegedly told their son that it could provide information about suicide for &quot;writing or world-building.&quot; A mother from Florida sued startup Character.AI in 2024 for allegedly causing her 14-year-old son&#39;s suicide. And just this September, the family of a 13-year-old girl filed <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/another-lawsuit-blames-an-ai-company-of-complicity-in-a-teenagers-suicide-184529475.html">another wrongful death lawsuit</a> against Character.AI, arguing that the company didn&#39;t point their daughter to any resources or notify authorities when she talked about her suicidal ideations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that the bill&#39;s co-sponsor Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) previously said that the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he leads, will <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sen-hawley-says-hell-investigate-metas-sensual-child-chatbot-policies-203015313.html">investigate</a> reports that Meta&#39;s AI chatbots could have &quot;sensual&quot; conversations with children. He made the announcement after <em>Reuters</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html">reported on an internal Meta document</a>, stating that Meta&#39;s AI was allowed to tell a shirtless eight-year-old: &quot;Every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/bipartisan-guard-act-proposes-age-restrictions-on-ai-chatbots-130020355.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-shorts-will-integrate-adobe-premieres-video-editing-tools-120013562.html">YouTube</a> will <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/383711785/youtube-s-strengthened-approach-to-online-gambling-and-graphic-violence-in-gaming">enforce new rules</a> that are supposed to strengthen the enforcement of its guidelines around online gambling and graphic video game content starting on November 17. One of the biggest changes it&#39;s implementing is age-restricting gaming videos featuring realistic human characters in scenes depicting torture or mass violence against non-combatants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The streaming website says it will take into account the duration and prominence of the scene in a video when reviewing one. For compilation videos, it will consider the cumulative duration of the scenes classified as graphic under its policies. Any video placed behind an age check barrier will be inaccessible to viewers under 18 or to anybody who&#39;s not signed into their Google accounts. YouTube didn&#39;t specify the duration that would get a video restricted, but a spokesperson told <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808545/youtube-graphic-video-game-violence-age-restriction"><em>The Verge</em></a> that &quot;certain content may be age-restricted if it’s non-fleeting or zoomed in.&quot; Creators can get around the restriction, however, by blurring any violent scene.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, YouTube is implementing stricter online gambling rules. It already prohibits videos directing people to online gambling sites or apps not certified by Google. Starting on November 17, it will also prohibit online gambling videos that involve items with monetary value, including digital goods like NFTs and game skins. The website is also age-restricting content with online casino-style games, even if they don&#39;t involve items with real monetary value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YouTube will review old videos and remove them or put them behind age checks if they&#39;re found to be in violation of the new rules, but it will not issue strikes to creators if they were uploaded before November 17. Creators can also edit their videos before that date with the website&#39;s trim and blur editing tools.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-will-strengthen-enforcement-around-violent-and-gambling-games-in-november-123051469.html?src=rss]]></description>

This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It&#39;s available in multiple colorways.</p> 
<p>We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html">best MacBook computers</a>.

The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That&#39;s well beyond a full day of work.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it&#39;s technically just a 13-inch panel. There&#39;s support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.</p> 
<p>This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There&#39;s no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html">released the MacBook Pro M5</a>, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of our favorite <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">power banks</a> is on sale for one of the best prices we&#39;ve seen, period. The Anker MagGo Power Bank 10K has dropped to only $57, which is 37 percent off its usual price. To put it into perspective, the lowest we&#39;ve tracked it is $54, and that only happened briefly at the end of 2024. Today&#39;s sale applies to multiple colorways.</p> 
<p>This model topped our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">best power banks</a>, and with very good reason. It&#39;s a workhorse that gets the job done. It includes Qi2 tech for fast wireless charging and ships with a sturdy kickstand to prop up smartphones during use. The integrated LED display makes it easy to see the battery percentage, which is always nice.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The 10,000mAh battery should charge a modern iPhone nearly two times before requiring a trip to the outlet. For those not keen on wireless charging, there&#39;s a USB-C port.</p> 
<p>As for compatibility, this power bank has been <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">optimized for Apple iPhones</a>.

The technology offers deeper blacks and better contrast than the LCDs currently used on those devices, which would make them better for things like content creation and entertainment. However, OLED is also more expensive, so it could result in higher prices on future models.</p>
<p>The company is currently testing versions of each product with OLED screens, according to people familiar with the matter. That display tech is usually reserved for higher-end PCs and tablets — right now, Apple only uses OLED screens in its iPad Pro lineup (apart from iPhones). However, it may be looking to boost flagging sales of Mac and iPad products, with OLED displays offering buyers a good reason to upgrade.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first device to gain the tech will probably be the iPad mini that may launch next year, according to Gurman&#39;s sources. The OLED version, code-named J510, may cost up to $100 more thanks to the new display and an updated water-resistant design. The iPad Air and MacBook Air will follow later on, possibly in 2028 in the case of the latter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, both Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-m6-macbook-pro-generation-will-reportedly-offer-touchscreens-203029809.html">predicted</a> that Apple would release a MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen in late 2026 or early 2027 — despite the fact that Steve Jobs famously hated touchscreens. It&#39;s not clear if the MacBook Air with OLED would also have a touch display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of the contrast and black level advantages, OLED displays are lighter than LCDs as they don&#39;t require a backlight. The main drawback is a lack of brightness. Apple&#39;s current MacBook Pros use MiniLED tech that does offer higher brightness levels, but has inferior contrast compared to OLED. Take these rumors with a grain of salt, of course, and even if they&#39;re accurate, Apple&#39;s plans may change.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apple-will-reportedly-shift-to-oled-displays-for-macbooks-ipad-air-and-mini-120005423.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When OpenAI launched its TikTok-like <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html">Sora app</a>, a key feature was &quot;Cameo&quot; that allows people to add any likeness to videos they generate. Now the maker of Cameo, an app that allows you to buy short videos from celebrities, has filed a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/dwvkqgzrbvm/CAMEO%20OPENAI%20TRADEMARK%20LAWSUIT%20%20complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> accusing OpenAI of violating its trademark by using the same name, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-sued-trademark-infringement-over-soras-cameo-feature-2025-10-28/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported. It claims that OpenAI&#39;s use of &quot;Cameo&quot; is likely to cause consumer confusion and dilute its brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Via the conduct alleged in this Complaint, OpenAI has knowingly co-opted a well-established, federally registered trademark, ignoring... the clear risk of consumer confusion, and the irreparable harm that will be inflicted on Plaintiff’s Cameo trademark rights and brand,&quot; the complaint states.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Open AI is reviewing the complaint, but &quot;disagree[s] that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word &#39;cameo,&#39;&quot; a spokesperson told <em>Reuters</em>. Meanwhile, Cameo&#39;s CEO Steven Galanis said it tried to resolve the dispute &quot;amicably,&quot; but OpenAI refused to stop using the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameo lets users choose from  a stable of celebrities — including the likes of Jon Gruden, Lisa Vanderpump and Colin Mochrie — to create short, personalized videos. Prices range from around $30 to $600 per video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sora, meanwhile, uses OpenAI&#39;s Sora 2 video generation tech to create and share videos. The app immediately drew attention over potentially unauthorized use of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/japan-asks-openai-not-to-infringe-on-irreplaceable-manga-and-anime-content-120008580.html">anime</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-suspends-sora-depictions-of-martin-luther-king-jr-following-a-request-from-his-family-110100581.html">deceased celebrities</a> and other legally protected sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameo stated that OpenAI not only used its name, but starting offering its own cameo service using deepfake likenesses of celebrities like Mark Cuban and Jake Paul. &quot;Users seeking a personalized celebrity video [could] use Plaintiff&#39;s Cameo service to book talent and receive an authentic, custom video prepared by that celebrity, or use Sora’s &#39;Cameo&#39; service to create an extremely realistic AI-generated video featuring a celebrity’s likeness,&quot; the lawsuit states.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/openai-sued-for-trademark-infringement-over-soras-cameo-feature-113047158.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like Surfshark VPN. Like I said in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html">Surfshark review</a>, it&#39;s the fastest VPN on the market, with download speeds that beat all the other <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a>. It also gives you universal split tunneling, multi-hop with customizable endpoints and unlimited simultaneous connections.</p>
<p>Surfshark does have its flaws, though. The apps hang up on error messages a bit too often and features sometimes turn on when you don&#39;t need them. If anything about Surfshark is annoying you enough that you&#39;re ready to switch, here&#39;s how you can cancel your subscription, get a refund and (if you want) delete your account altogether.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-auto-renewal-on-surfshark"><strong>How to cancel auto-renewal on Surfshark</strong></h2>
<p>To cancel Surfshark, all you need to do is stop your subscription from automatically renewing. After you cancel auto-renewal, you can keep using Surfshark for the rest of the period you paid for (unless you get the refund or delete your account entirely). Assuming you bought your subscription through the Surfshark website, follow these steps to cancel.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to Surfshark.com. At the top-right of the screen, click <strong>My account.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Enter your username and password, then log in. You&#39;ll be taken to your account dashboard at my.surfshark.com.</p></li>
<li><p>At the top-right of the screen, click your account email address. Click on <strong>Subscription </strong>in the drop-down menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Payments </strong>tab under the words &quot;Your subscription.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down to the &quot;Subscription details&quot; section. Next to your Surfshark subscription, click on <strong>Cancel auto-renewal.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s all there is to it. Remember that unless it&#39;s been 30 days or less since you subscribed, you won&#39;t be able to get a refund, and Surfshark doesn&#39;t offer prorating for unused time. Additionally, you can always cancel Surfshark by simply opening a live-chat window and asking the support team to do it for you — just be warned that you&#39;ll probably be asked to reconsider several times first.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-surfshark-if-you-subscribed-through-an-app-store"><strong>How to cancel Surfshark if you subscribed through an app store</strong></h3>
<p>If you subscribed through an app store, the cancellation process is different. You&#39;ll have to stop your auto-renewal through the platform where you first bought the subscription. In this section, I&#39;ll cover how to cancel through the desktop versions of each app store, since requests submitted there are more likely to work. Just note that you can do the same thing by going to the subscriptions section of your profile on the appropriate mobile app store.</p>
<p>If you bought Surfshark through the Google Play Store, open play.google.com on a desktop computer. Click the circle at the top-right that contains your account&#39;s first initial, then click <strong>Payments &amp; subscriptions</strong> in the menu that appears. On the new page, click the <strong>Subscriptions </strong>tab, then scroll down until you find Surfshark. Click <strong>Manage, </strong>click <strong>Cancel Subscription </strong>and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>If you went through the Apple App store, a desktop computer is also the easiest way to cancel. Open the App Store in macOS, click <strong>Sign In </strong>at the bottom-left, then enter your email and Apple ID password. After signing in, check the bottom-left again and click your name, then click <strong>Account Settings </strong>at the top-right. Click <strong>Subscriptions</strong>, find Surfshark, then click <strong>Edit </strong>and <strong>Cancel Subscription.</strong></p>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-surfshark-if-you-subscribed-through-amazon"><strong>How to cancel Surfshark if you subscribed through Amazon</strong></h3>
<p>You can buy Surfshark through Amazon, but if you do, you&#39;ll also have to cancel through Amazon. Go to Amazon and log in to your account. At the top-right, click <strong>Account &amp; Lists, </strong>then <strong>Membership &amp; Subscriptions. </strong>Scroll until you find Surfshark and click <strong>Cancel Subscription.</strong> After that, follow the onscreen prompts.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-delete-your-surfshark-account"><strong>How to delete your Surfshark account</strong></h2>
<p>It&#39;s possible to delete your Surfshark account and immediately end your association with every Surfshark app, but there&#39;s no direct method — your only option is to start a live chat conversation. To do that, go to support.surfshark.com, scroll to the bottom and click <strong>Chat with us. </strong>In the conversation window, tell the bot you want to delete your Surfshark account. Be prepared to fend off several requests for you to reconsider.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-surfshark"><strong>How to get a refund from Surfshark</strong></h2>
<p>Surfshark offers a full refund within 30 days of purchase. Live chat is the only way to request a refund. Go to support.surfshark.com and click <strong>Chat with us </strong>at the bottom of the page, then tell the live chat bot you want a full refund. It&#39;ll guide you from there.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/bfe95c50-b43a-11f0-a77f-db22ef08b02b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/bfe95c50-b43a-11f0-a77f-db22ef08b02b" style="height:1769px;width:3284px;" alt="Surfshark chat with us" data-uuid="8967f2fe-1f14-3985-9e36-b309388243d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>If you subscribed through Amazon or an app store, you&#39;ll need to request the refund through there instead. The typical refund policy for each platform applies, superseding Surfshark.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-surfshark-alternatives"><strong>Surfshark alternatives</strong></h2>
<p>After you&#39;ve cancelled Surfshark, I strongly recommend considering another VPN — it&#39;s not only a vital privacy precaution, but opens up worlds of streaming fun as well. My favorite for both price and performance is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a>, but <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html">NordVPN</a> is also a good choice, providing a similar experience to Surfshark but with apps that function a bit better. If you&#39;re prepared to pay a bit more for a service that works seamlessly, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">ExpressVPN</a> may be for you.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-your-surfshark-subscription-110005758.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p></p> 
<p>No pun intended, but what I like about <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Quicken;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Quicken&amp;linkText=Quicken+Simplifi&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGQxMjgyYzMtOTllZC00ZGRjLWI4YWItYzEwYzYwZDRlNzBjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3F1aWNrZW4uY29tL2xwL3BwYy9zaW1wbGlmaS12cy1taW50LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAay1xJNTnjYldw5nF1qz8tSfhiJSkTuaz3OiZWyrTB-K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fquicken.com%2Flp%2Fppc%2Fsimplifi-vs-mint%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://quicken.com/lp/ppc/simplifi-vs-mint/">Quicken Simplifi</a> is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Another one of the key features I appreciate is the ability to set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch).</p> 
<p>Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there&#39;s a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.</p>

<p>In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase.</p> 
<p>The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average.</p> 
<p>Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.”</p>

My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it&#39;s more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it.</p> 
<p>Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You&#39;ll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.</p>

<p>Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=introduced&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9yZXBvcnRzLWNhbmFkYS1pbXByb3ZlZC1zeW5jaW5nIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L3JlcG9ydHMtY2FuYWRhLWltcHJvdmVkLXN5bmNpbmcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeK62o1SLpdRxDJdlcN8USUe_xrXlKuyGd4uvsYmoaYy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Freports-canada-improved-syncing" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/reports-canada-improved-syncing">introduced</a> a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph.</p> 
<p>The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dd1282c3-99ed-4ddc-b8ab-c10c60d4e70c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+expanded+on+the+net+worth+graph&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9uZXctbmV0LXdvcnRoLWNoYXJ0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWFuZC1tb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZDEyODJjMy05OWVkLTRkZGMtYjhhYi1jMTBjNjBkNGU3MGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmFyY2htb25leS5jb20vd2hhdHMtbmV3L25ldy1uZXQtd29ydGgtY2hhcnQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtYW5kLW1vcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVv90h2WMw7_4yXuvFvGDLlzhRQRUn1jj223BWdeKJX5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2Fwhats-new%2Fnew-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/whats-new/new-net-worth-chart-investment-transactions-and-more">Monarch expanded on the net worth graph</a>, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time.</p> 
<p>On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.mx.com/">MX</a> and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://help.simplifimoney.com/en/articles/8545901-how-to-import-transactions-from-mint">has a Chrome extension</a> for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data.</p>

Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch&#39;s to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month.</p> 
<p>Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn&#39;t provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://copilot.money/">Copilot Money</a> might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there.</p>

<p>There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses.</p> 
<p>Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing.</p>

<p>Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="mailto:venmo@venmo.com">venmo@venmo.com</a> are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app.</p> 
<p>While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits.</p> 
<p>Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well.</p> 
<p>Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://intelligence.copilot.money/">its website</a>, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year.</p> 
<p>Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>You may know <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a> as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too.</p> 
<p>Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA).</p>

<p>As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you&#39;ll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though.</p> 
<p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says.</p> 
<p>Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring.</p> 
<p>Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay).</p>

A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you.</p> 
<p>Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting.</p> 
<p>The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week).</p> 
<p>My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-how-ynab-gives-me-peace-of-mind-and-keeps-my-money-in-check-140049410.html">penned a respectful rebuttal</a>, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-mint-alternatives-we-tested">Other Mint alternatives we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pocketguard">PocketGuard</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://pocketguard.com/">PocketGuard</a> used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and <em>that’s </em>what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.</p> 
<p>Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-plaid-and-how-does-it-work">What is Plaid and how does it work?</h2> 
<figure>
 <img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-12/771314a0-9dd8-11ee-bfd6-843fb91c197b" data-uuid="234d7d99-eaf4-394f-a470-272c173de523">
 <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure> 
<p>Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://plaid.com/company/">the company claims</a>.</p> 
<p>To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.</p> 
<p>As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html">Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit</a> for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.</p> 
<p>In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-import-your-financial-data-from-the-mint-app">How to import your financial data from the Mint app</h2> 
<p>Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data.</p> 
<p>To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><p>Sign into Mint.com and hit <strong>Transactions</strong> in the menu on the left side of the screen.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Select an account, or <strong>all accounts</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Scroll down and look for “<strong>export [number] transactions</strong>” in smaller print.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Your CSV file should begin downloading.</p></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-mint-alternatives">How we tested Mint alternatives</h2> 
<p>Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)</p> 
<p>Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.</p> 
<p>Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint alternative</a> myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable <em>Groundhog Day</em> of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>California-based AI and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/the-robots-we-saw-at-ces-2025-the-good-the-bad-and-the-completely-unhinged-174529774.html">robotics</a> company 1X is now accepting pre-orders for its humanoid robot <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.1x.tech/order">NEO</a>, which was designed to automate everyday chores and to offer personalized assistance. Users will be able to control NEO and have it accomplish tasks around the house with the click of a button or a verbal command. It will come with the ability to do basic tasks autonomously when it starts shipping next year, including opening doors, fetching items and turning the lights on or off. However, if early adopters want NEO to be capable of more specific or complex tasks, they&#39;d have to be comfortable with the idea of a human teleoperator controlling the robot remotely and seeing inside their homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Wall Street Journal;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dc3c1cc1-7f7f-4894-b3cf-3e3a5d2d6202&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;linkText=The+Wall+Street+Journal%27s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvcGVyc29uYWwtdGVjaC9pLXRyaWVkLXRoZS1yb2JvdC10aGF0cy1jb21pbmctdG8tbGl2ZS13aXRoLXlvdS1pdHMtc3RpbGwtcGFydC1odW1hbi02ODUxNWQ0NCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGMzYzFjYzEtN2Y3Zi00ODk0LWIzY2YtM2UzYTVkMmQ2MjAyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvcGVyc29uYWwtdGVjaC9pLXRyaWVkLXRoZS1yb2JvdC10aGF0cy1jb21pbmctdG8tbGl2ZS13aXRoLXlvdS1pdHMtc3RpbGwtcGFydC1odW1hbi02ODUxNWQ0NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfy7vnuPsO7HG-TFfcFlBqXouZ8liL2cdVJ6_5oqZrQO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fpersonal-tech%2Fi-tried-the-robot-thats-coming-to-live-with-you-its-still-part-human-68515d44" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/i-tried-the-robot-thats-coming-to-live-with-you-its-still-part-human-68515d44"><em>The Wall Street Journal&#39;s</em></a> Joanna Stern, 1X CEO Bernt Børnich explained that the AI neural network running the machine still needs to learn from more real-world experiences. Børnich said that anybody who buys NEO for delivery next year will have to agree that a human operator will be seeing inside their houses through the robot&#39;s camera. It&#39;s necessary to be able to teach the machines and gather training data so it can eventually perform tasks autonomously. &quot;If we don&#39;t have your data, we can&#39;t make the product better,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Børnich admitted that much of the work will be done by teleoperators in the beginning. Owners will have access to an app where they can schedule when the teleoperator can take over NEO and where they can specify the task they want the machine to do. He said 1X is putting control in the hands of the owner to respect people&#39;s privacy as much as possible. The company can blur people so that the remote operator doesn&#39;t see them, and owners can designate no-go zones in their homes that the operator cannot go to. Teleoperators also cannot take control of NEO without the owner&#39;s approval. Of course, there&#39;s always potential security breaches to think of — Børnich at least assured that NEO has several layers of security to prevent it from hurting people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1X NEO is available in tan, gray and dark brown. It&#39;s now available for pre-order from the company&#39;s website with a deposit of $200. Those who want early access to it can get it for $20,000, but it will also be available as a subscription service of $499 a month.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been nearly three years since Withings first showed off <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-urine-monitoring-device-ces-2023-010057961.html">U-Scan to a bemused world</a>, and now it’s finally on sale. U-Scan is the company’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/urine-analysis-tech-ces-2023-roundup-150012618.html">at-home urinalysis gizmo</a> which sits in your toilet bowl and tests your first splash of the day. The device runs a tiny sample through a microfluidic to test, depending on what cartridge you use, either your nutritional or kidney health. These results are then sent to the Withings app, letting you track the quality of your urine over time. Your humble narrator holds the dubious honor of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-u-scan-hands-on-video-ces-2023-232906933.html">being the first reporter to test the U-Scan during its debut</a>, and found the results pretty interesting.</p> 
<p>There are two cartridges available at launch, the first dubbed Nutrio, which looks at your body’s response to nutrition. It will look at your urine’s pH, specific gravity, ketones and the presence of vitamin C over time. Those factors can help you understand if your diet is too acidic, how much fluid you’re drinking on a regular basis, if you’re burning fat, and your anti oxidant intake. The company says that Nutri will be of special interest to people taking GLP-1 medication for weight loss to help them monitor changes to their nutrition levels. Calci, meanwhile, will track your urine’s pH, specific gravity and calcium levels, to keep an eye on your risk of developing kidney stones.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Naturally, such a tool will not be the most affordable in the world, and you can expect to pay a hefty price to own one. Pay $379.95 and you’ll be able to get a U-Scan, a single cartridge that will last for three months, and access to Withings+. The options are then split across “Proactive” and “Intensive” Plans, with the former giving you 2-4 analyses per week, while the latter runs near-daily. If you want the closer monitoring, then $449.96 will get you two cartridges and Withings+ access, which will last you the same three month window. As for replacement cartridges, those on the Proactive tier will spend $99.95 every quarter, while those in team Intensive will pay $179.95. As part of signing up for Withings+, you’ll get a free coaching session with a registered dietician available in all 50 states.</p>

Board was designed by entrepreneur Brynn Putnam, alongside former <em>World of Warcraft</em> exec Seth Sivac, as a way to make the idea of &quot;screen time&quot; a more immersive in-person experience. &quot;Families want to connect, but they’re competing with incredibly powerful technologies,&quot; Putnam told <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a3d97c91-2516-4b2d-b3f3-571fd0f4b810&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=USA+TODAY&amp;linkText=USA+Today&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC8yMDI1LzEwLzI4L25ldy1jb25zb2xlLW1ha2VzLXNjcmVlbnMtc29jaWFsLzg2OTM0OTI2MDA3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTNkOTdjOTEtMjUxNi00YjJkLWIzZjMtNTcxZmQwZjRiODEwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC8yMDI1LzEwLzI4L25ldy1jb25zb2xlLW1ha2VzLXNjcmVlbnMtc29jaWFsLzg2OTM0OTI2MDA3LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdJ_2mzXpJcOC1gVNWqWX_Bbm70BMtMbrZfT6xA6EFqM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2025%2F10%2F28%2Fnew-console-makes-screens-social%2F86934926007%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:USA TODAY;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/10/28/new-console-makes-screens-social/86934926007/"><em>USA Today</em></a>. &quot;Board is about flipping that dynamic — using tech to support real human connection instead of replacing it.&quot; </p><p>The product acts like a typical tabletop game that you lay out flat, just like the cardboard play space for <em>Monopoly</em> or <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, but it offers additional digital interactions on the digital screen. The 12 games included are original to Board, each with unique piece sets.&nbsp;</p><p>Putnam has past experience creating tech that blends the physical and the digital. Her previous project, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-06-mirror-fitness.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Mirror</a>, was a workout screen for delivering live fitness classes at home. The company later got bought up by lululemon for a cool $500 million. Putnam is billing Board as &quot;the first ever face-to-face gaming console&quot; and at $499, its price tag nearly matches what you&#39;d expect for current console hardware. And that’s the limited time offer; the website says Board will normally retail for $699. The sales pitch leans hard on the idea of connecting families without their phones, but for that cost, you could also buy more than a dozen different board and card games to eliminate the screens altogether. And screens don’t have to be the enemy.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two directors from <em>MultiVersus</em> are striking out on their own, forming a new, independent game studio. The platform brawler&#39;s production director, Justin Fischer, and technical director, Brock Feldman, have joined forces to launch a new endeavor called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.airlockgames.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Airlock Games</a>. Rather than continuing to follow the AAA route, the first project from Airlock is a sci-fi sim management horror game called <em>What the Stars Forgot</em>. The team plans to run a Kickstarter to generate backing for the game ahead of a planned early access launch in December.</p><p>Player First Games, the studio behind <em>MultiVersus</em>, was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-has-bought-the-developer-behind-its-multiversus-brawler-180355445.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">acquired</a> by WB Games last summer, but despite a promising early showing, the game was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/season-5-of-multiversus-will-be-its-last-154839513.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">shuttered</a> in May at the close of its fifth season. But the choice for devs to bounce back with something new and smaller is becoming <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sackbird-studios-emerges-from-the-xbox-layoffs-214000161.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">a familiar refrain</a> in the games industry after several years of layoffs and cancelations. After so many highly anticipated projects have gotten the axe as a money-saving, cost-cutting decision by large outfits, it makes sense that devs might want to have more control over their own destinies.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra35HZx7lL0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-pair-of-multiversus-directors-are-launching-a-new-game-studio-211118742.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With digital games outselling physical ones by embarrassing margins, it&#39;s easy to conclude that the latter is done for. But sometimes, approaching extinction leads to pockets of nostalgic enthusiasm. (Think the modest <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/say-cheese-5-reasons-why-digital-cameras-are-trendy-again/">resurgence</a> that point-and-shoot cameras are currently enjoying.) That leaves room for Limited Run Games, which specializes in physical copies. The company&#39;s latest showcase, LRG3, is happening on Wednesday.</p>
<p>This month marks the 10th anniversary of Limited Run Games. There&#39;s been plenty of fun stuff during that decade. LRG has launched <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/666-edition-of-doom-includes-game-box-that-itself-plays-doom-165022410.html">physical editions of <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom II</em></a> — complete with a game box that plays (yep!) <em>Doom</em>. For LucasArts fans, there was a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/monkey-island-limited-run-games-202816837.html">Monkey Island box set</a> (Guybrush statue in tow!). LRG also launched physical editions of indie games like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-10-celeste-limited-run-games-physical-release-2019.html"><em>Celeste</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-24-runner-2-and-other-indie-hits-get-rare-physical-releases.html"><em>Runner 2</em></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What&#39;s on tap for the anniversary event? Well, your guess is as good as ours. But the company did tease some of the partners who will have announcements. They include Ubisoft, Square Enix Collective, Astral Shift, Retroware, The MIX and WayForward.</p>
<p>LRG3 begins on Wednesday, October 29, at noon ET.

There are no other details available about the project, including what show or movie it will be based on, so place your guesses now.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix&#39;s game strategy took some hits over the past year with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-has-closed-its-aaa-gaming-studio-133014946.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">closure of its Team Blue studio</a> for AAA game development and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-scuttles-plans-to-add-six-previously-announced-games-to-its-service-192946233.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">walking back plans to add six titles</a> to its lineup.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not for the first time this year, Google has been forced to reassure its users that it has not suffered a large-scale data breach that could affect their Gmail accounts. A few months ago the company released an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-says-reports-of-a-major-gmail-security-issue-are-entirely-false-224812292.html">unusual statement</a> intended to put to bed allegations that its email service had been hit with a serious security issue. And it did so again this week, after numerous news outlets <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=3afb55920348a5a5&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB936GB937&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifP2uC8u0b3YFNBdU8yoho00_Squvw:1761672707275&amp;q=google+183+million&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnms&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZrjP_Cx0LI1Ytb_FGcOviEiaSXTsdMUiuBeEuSNqG6MG8oQyjOk95qL_zJApekKEtYXyNm712S9jsHTWU76Jbs8_TtANNAMCsGFjNj8NK-MXBKLBxb0leWd1gx4O6QSzNisyoGn6FmcR_ZySialdIpwSfc9MjEdSaR4zCWuyhcZBxeGTbKZ0F6EVgGdyd6yr8bIwv8w&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiU3bWftseQAxXlWkEAHYCtO_QQ0pQJegQIFRAB&amp;biw=1433&amp;bih=696&amp;dpr=2">published stories</a> suggesting that 183 million passwords may have been compromised in a new breach.</p>
<p>Google has since <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1982893232934793655">claimed</a> that this isn’t true in posts on X. It says the listed accounts are likely not fresh victims of an attack, but instead recent additions to the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"><em>Have I Been Pwne</em>d</a> data breach search engine’s database. The website is a free resource that can quickly tell users if their personal data has been hacked. As noted by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-disputes-false-claims-of-massive-gmail-data-breach/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, <em>HIBP</em>’s creator, Troy Hunt, has said in a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-synthient-threat-data/">blog post</a> that over 90 percent of the millions of stolen credentials have been seen before, so are in no way new (16.4 million of addresses were however showing up for the first time in a data breach, according to Hunt).</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Reports of a &#39;Gmail security breach impacting millions of users&#39; are false,&quot; Google said in a statement. &quot;Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected. The inaccurate reports are stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases, which routinely compile various credential theft activity occurring across the web. It’s not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform.&quot;</p>
<p>Google does use compilations of open credentials like the one recently uploaded to <em>HIBP</em> to alert its users of possible breaches, and has advised users that turning on 2-step verification and adopting passkeys is more secure than relying on passwords alone, which it notes should always be reset immediately if compromised.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-once-again-disputing-gmail-was-breached-180031380.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The transition to the more-secure HTTPS web protocol has plateaued, according to Google. As of 2020, 95 to 99 percent of navigations in Chrome use HTTPS. To help make it safer for users to click on links, Chrome will enable a setting called Always Use Secure Connections for public sites for all users by default. This will happen in October 2026 with the release of Chrome 154.&nbsp;</p><p>The change will happen earlier for those who have switched on Enhanced Safe Browsing protections in Chrome. Google will enable Always Use Secure Connections by default in April when Chrome 147 drops. When this setting is on, Chrome will ask for your permission before it first accesses a public website that doesn&#39;t use HTTPS.&nbsp;</p><p>Google has been moving in this direction for some time. Chrome started <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-24-chrome-now-alerts-you-to-unsecure-http-sites.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">alerting users</a> to unsecure HTTP websites in 2018 and it began <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-https-first-mode-170051682.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">defaulting to HTTPS</a> in April 2021. The following year, it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-https-first-mode-170051682.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">started offering</a> Always Use Secure Connections on an opt-in basis.&nbsp;</p><p>When HTTPS isn&#39;t used, an attacker can reroute the connection with relative ease and target a user with malware, social engineering attacks or other exploits. &quot;Attacks like this are not hypothetical — software to hijack navigations is readily available and attackers have previously used insecure HTTP to compromise user devices in a targeted attack,&quot; the Chrome team wrote in a blog post. &quot;Since attackers only need a single insecure navigation, they don&#39;t need to worry that many sites have adopted HTTPS — any single HTTP navigation may offer a foothold. What&#39;s worse, many plaintext HTTP connections today are entirely invisible to users, as HTTP sites may immediately redirect to HTTPS sites.&quot; Always Use Secure Connections is one of the Chrome team&#39;s attempts to mitigate such risks.</p><p>HTTP connections still persist in navigations to private sites, such as local IP addresses and company intranets. It&#39;s complicated for a private site to obtain an HTTPS certificate (something Engadget has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-10-engadget-moved-to-https-because-we-love-you.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">had since 2016</a>, fact fans), because the same private name can point to different hosts on multiple networks. For instance, many router manufacturers use &quot;192.168.0.1&quot; as a local IP address for accessing the hardware&#39;s admin panel. Still, HTTP navigations to private sites are inherently less risky than on the public web. They aren&#39;t entirely safe, but the only vector of attack for HTTP on private sites is from within the local network.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-chrome-will-finally-default-to-secure-https-connections-starting-in-april-170000603.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Battlefield 6&#39;s </em>free battle royale game <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-the-new-free-to-play-battle-royale-launches-today/">is now available for download</a><em>. </em>This follows <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dataminers-claim-mysterious-granite-files-related-to-this-weeks-patch-could-be-a-shadowdrop-for-its-battle-royale-mode/">numerous leaks</a> that have been popping up ever since the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-finally-a-trailer-for-battlefield-6-but-no-multiplayer-details-just-yet-170144110.html">mainline game hit store shelves</a> on October 10.</p>
<p>It&#39;s called <em>Battlefield: Redsec </em>and it&#39;s free for everyone.<em>&nbsp;</em>You don&#39;t need the full-priced game to play. This puts it in direct competition with Call of Duty&#39;s own free-to-play battle royale, <em>Warzone</em>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="acfaac5d783a469ab2c98e9784e453f1"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn8k1g3vMDU?si=GBzvyE1CBAUkFqBL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><em>Redsec</em> has a few gameplay modes. There&#39;s the usual battle royale, with a big ole map that allows for up to 48 simultaneous players. This mode offers four gameplay classes, plenty of weapons to choose from and unique objectives that reward players with &quot;powerful items.&quot; The end goal, as always, is to be the last soldier standing.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a duo mode that lets two players jump into a battle royale at once. This version is intended for newcomers, so it gives access to a smaller map.</p>
<p>The Gauntlet mode offers a twist on a traditional battle royale. Eight squads of four players compete &quot;in a series of special operations that push every squad to their limit.&quot; EA says this is perfect for those who like traditional multiplayer FPS games. Users create custom loadouts and completing various objectives awards the team with points.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s integration with the Battlefield Portal toolset. This lets players design their own experiences. EA gives examples of a battle royale match that just allows access to sledgehammers or one with only headshots. These tools are also free.</p>
<div id="c966e8d7651a472a8de4b55b5b7d88f0"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Umw-SKuh0LY?si=U-mjztsJ7Kq9qWxS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>We don&#39;t know how or if this battle royale will interact with the main game. <em>Warzone</em> typically includes a story that ties into whatever&#39;s going on with Call of Duty&#39;s seasonal content drops. To that end, Season 1 of <em>Battlefield 6</em> also releases on October 28. This update includes new maps, modes, vehicles, guns, attachments and cosmetic items.</p>
<p><em>Battlefield: Redsec</em> is available on every platform that <em>Battlefield 6</em> is available on, including PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S. This could end up being a pretty big hit for EA, as the main game managed to sell <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-copies-in-three-days-181826351.html">7 million copies in three days</a>.</p>

The studio has put together the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://simogo.com/work/simogolegacycollection/" data-i13n="slk:Simogo Legacy Collection;cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Simogo Legacy Collection</em></a><em> </em>for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3817040/Simogo_Legacy_Collection/" data-i13n="slk:Steam;cpos:2;pos:1">Steam</a>, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. This includes all seven of the mobile games that the developer released between 2010 and 2015, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-14-year-walks-eerie-swedish-scares-creep-onto-steam-march-6.html" data-i13n="slk:Year Walk;cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Year Walk</em></a><em> </em>and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-02-joystiq-top-10-of-2013-device-6-2001.html" data-i13n="slk:Device 6;cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Device 6</em></a>. The collection will be available on December 2 — the 15th anniversary of the release of Simogo’s first game, <em>Kosmo Spin — </em>and it costs $15.</p><p>Co-founder Simon Flesser noted that the studio&#39;s mobile games were in &quot;constant danger of disappearing or ending up being unplayable.&quot; (<em>Year Walk </em>was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-15-year-walk-wii-u-port.html" data-i13n="slk:ported to Wii U;cpos:5;pos:1">ported to Wii U</a> but we all know what happened with that console.) The idea behind <em>Simogo Legacy Collection </em>is to preserve them and “keep the experience as close as possible to the original games,&quot; Flesser said. As such, the team has made as few changes as possible while still making sure the games work on PC and Nintendo’s consoles.</p><p>You can use touchscreen controls on Switch and Switch 2 to play the games as they were originally intended. Simogo has also added support for mice, controllers, motion controls and, on Switch 2, dual mouse controls. The bundle includes a bunch of extras too, such as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-04-year-walk-free-scary-stories-ebook.html" data-i13n="slk:an ebook of Year Walk side stories;cpos:6;pos:1">an ebook of <em>Year Walk </em>side stories</a>, a podcast for <em>The Sailor’s Dream</em>, additional music, playable prototypes of the games and more.</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-3KAFjba92s?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>That’s not all, though. Simogo is working on Switch 2 versions of its two most recent games, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-preview-this-may-be-my-goty-140030011.html" data-i13n="slk:Lorelei and the Laser Eyes;cpos:7;pos:1"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/an-enhanced-version-of-sayonara-wild-hearts-for-ps5-is-out-now-174752837.html" data-i13n="slk:Sayonara Wild Hearts;cpos:8;pos:1"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a>. Expect those to arrive in early 2026. The studio is also bringing <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts </em>back to iOS as a paid app next year. That was a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-11-sayonara-wild-hearts-switch-ps4-release-date-apple-arcade.html" data-i13n="slk:launch game for Apple Arcade;cpos:9;pos:1">launch game for Apple Arcade</a> in 2019, but it left the service in 2024. I’m very much looking forward to having my favorite game available on a device I carry with me everywhere again, even though it’s available on PC and consoles as well.</p><p>As well as those projects, the studio has teamed up with Lost in Cult to create a coffee table book about the history of Simogo. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo" data-i13n="slk:Heartbeats, Dreams and Laser Eyes: 15 years of Simogo;cpos:10;pos:1"><em>Heartbeats, Dreams and Laser Eyes: 15 years of Simogo</em></a> is a softback book with around 250 pages. A deluxe edition with a semi-translucent wrap, a bookmark, commemorative stamp set and (for the first 300 units) a signed bookplate will be available too. Pre-orders open today and the book is expected to ship in late 2026.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/year-walk-device-6-and-other-early-simogo-games-are-coming-to-steam-and-nintendo-consoles-160056076.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oppo’s latest flagship phone, like the sleek (but hard to buy) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-oppo-find-n5-hands-on-release-date-price-120058154.html">Find N5 foldable</a>, goes hard on the tech specifications. In fact, the Find X9 Pro’s specs read like a wishlist of what many want to see in their phones, with a huge 7,500mAh battery, a 200-megapixel telephoto camera and a bright 6.78-inch screen with tiny, almost one-millimeter bezels, all while still measuring in at 8.25mm in thickness. Oh, and an optional telephoto lens add-on that boosts camera zoom to 10x.</p>
<p>The Find X9 Pro will be priced at £1,099 (roughly $1,459). The biggest drawback may be that, despite the Find X9 series being Oppo’s biggest phone launch yet, it won’t be available in the US. Still, with everything that’s crammed into this phone, I had to try it out. Do I really want a thinner smartphone? Or one that lasts multiple days before it needs recharging? And man, this telephoto lens is certainly eye-catching.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-display-and-design"><strong>Display and design</strong></h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8a3c8b1-b3f8-11f0-bb3a-92d51df1faad" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8a3c8b1-b3f8-11f0-bb3a-92d51df1faad" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Oppo Find X9 hands-on" data-uuid="2dc50996-3162-3c6c-b662-970e79cadc03"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The Find X9 Pro has a 6.78-inch display, with peak outdoor brightness at 3,600 nits. On paper, that beats the iPhone 17 Pro, but most people with phones older than a year or two will notice how much brighter phones like the X9 Pro are. Another notable feature is a 1-nit minimal brightness to reduce eye strain when using the phone in the dark. Or in bed. Which we shouldn’t do, but we all do. Oppo has also included high-frequency pixel dimming to further reduce the screen&#39;s harshness.</p>
<p>Like recent phones from its business cousin, OnePlus, Oppo has added a new button on this year’s Find X model. The Snap key is on the left of the device, and can be customized to launch apps like the voice recorder, translation apps and flashlight. Meanwhile, the right edge houses the Find X9’s Quick Button, which is ostensibly the camera button. Double-tapping it launches the camera app. While it’s not as elaborate as the iPhone’s Camera Control, you can swipe on the button to zoom in and out while using the camera, which is a simple, welcome addition.</p>
<p>Alongside Mediatek&#39;s new Dimensity 9500 chip, the Find X9 Pro is another flagship phone with a silicon-carbon battery. With a higher energy density than graphite-based batteries, this means longer battery life without making the phone bigger or thicker. At 7,000mAh, the battery is huge. That’s far bigger than the battery found in foldables like Samsung’s Z Fold 7 (4,400 mAh) and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (4,650 mAh). It’s even bigger than the one in the OnePlus 13 (6,000 mAh). Fortunately, the Find X9 supports suitably swift charging speeds, with support for 80W SUPERVOOC and 50W wireless charging. During my time with the phone, it would often last two days on a charge. Even after a day of heavy camera use, Google Maps and streaming video, I didn’t need to recharge the Find X9 Pro until late afternoon on the second day.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-cameras"><strong>Cameras</strong></h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8d31612-b3f8-11f0-a6f9-d00dbd7c013a" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8d31612-b3f8-11f0-a6f9-d00dbd7c013a" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Oppo Find X9 hands-on" data-uuid="bc729bb7-70a8-3e24-885a-c97d0675d7db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The Find X9 Pro’s camera consists of a 50-megapixel main sensor with f/1.5 lens and optical image stabilization. There’s also a 50MP ultrawide camera and arguably the most technically impressive part: a 200MP periscope camera with an f/2.1 lens and OIS. This is further augmented with an attachable teleconverter lens — more on that later.</p>
<p>Oppo’s Hasselblad collaboration focuses on telephoto, though the company calls its entire camera setup the Hasselblad Master Camera System. I’m not sure it needed such a label.To make the most of the high-resolution sensor, the camera app includes a new Hi-Res mode to capture at 200MP for the telephoto lens and 50MP when using the other two camera sensors. The company warns that the mode is best used in well-lit environments, as it strips out pixel binning and other computational photography techniques that are used when there’s limited light.</p>
<p>But that’s not really the point: it’s all about the zoom. The telephoto has a base 3x optical zoom, which can be cropped to a 6x zoom with a 50MP image. It’s worth noting that all the cameras on the Find X9 can capture at 50MP. If the phone detects more challenging shooting conditions, it automatically drops down to 25MP or 12MP shots. In reality, I didn’t notice the resolution jump in most photos I took, although the rich foliage in some of my landscape shots showcases how much detail the camera system is able to capture.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8d31610-b3f8-11f0-b753-2f5b63b7fb43" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8d31610-b3f8-11f0-b753-2f5b63b7fb43" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Oppo Find X9 hands-on" data-uuid="e3e7f38b-8fee-30ea-a673-211ec2e10476"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Oppo says its computational photography know-how pushes the zoom here to 13.2x, but its algorithms can get a little aggressive and messy with faces and detail at the higher digital zoom settings. Take a look at these pictures taken across a hillside. While the foliage appears crisp and detailed, the walkers are blurry and there’s a halo effect around them. At other times, computational photography turned pedestrians into nightmarish faces.</p>
<p>In yet another opportunity to mention the Hasselblad collab, there’s also an XPAN shooting mode for cinematic 65:24 images. Conversely, if you’re into a disposable camera aesthetic, the Find X9 series can also trigger an aggressive double-flash to mimic ‘00s photography.</p>
<p>The same zoom capabilities are available in video capture, too, and the company has added a new Sound Focus mode to strip out ambient noise, which worked better than I expected it to. There are several more video recording upgrades, including full LOG recording (activated in settings) and an integrated LUT preview to check color grading in real time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8c2c261-b3f8-11f0-bfff-71b726ed3112" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f8c2c261-b3f8-11f0-bfff-71b726ed3112" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Oppo Find X9 hands-on" data-uuid="16f04e7a-53d4-3466-b5f7-033ceff63269"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Then there’s the attachable lens. Oppo’s Hasselblad Teleconverter is a solid, premium peripheral, with a metal barrel and some heft. It extends the Find X9’s optical zoom to 10x, with an equivalent focal length of 230mm. Thanks to the high-res 200MP Telephoto camera sensor, you can punch in at up to 200x digital zoom for stills and 50x zoom for video, although the sweet spot is certainly more in the middle. The add-on teleconverter lens, while not entirely new (<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_X200">Vivo did it first</a>), may be the most intriguing part.</p>
<p>You need to use a specific case and mounting plate to securely attach the lens to the phone, but when it’s locked in, it feels solid and very secure. It also looks, well, how it looks. Because it’s such a slender lens, it looks like something you might use for espionage. It doesn’t even look like a point-and-shoot camera. It’s… eye-catching, but also so much fun.</p>

<p>I’ve been testing the Find X9’s camera chops for a few weeks, and it’s been a lot of fun to zoom in with optical zoom clarity, whether at concerts, movie premieres or taking pictures of my nieces during hectic Play-Doh sessions. What’s particularly attractive is the combination of high detail and bokeh effect. With the leap in zoom, I had to ensure I was far enough away in order to use the teleconverter, or it would struggle to focus.</p>

<p>Oppo is pitching its new flagship as the ultimate phone for concerts and live events, and the zoom range is very impressive. Perhaps understandably, when zooming so much, there is a high risk of blurry shots. Oppo includes a special tripod mount that attaches to the lens barrel to ensure the whole thing doesn’t tip over, but it’s one step too far for me. Carrying around the teleconverter and mounting plate is already a lot. It’s also a bit of a chore to have to detach the plate when using the camera without the teleconverter. Oddly, the plate covers the other sensors, meaning that if you want a closer focal point (or want to use anything besides the telephoto sensor), it’s an additional pain point before you can take the photo.</p>
<p>It’s unusual that a phone’s “main” camera isn’t the star of the show, but that may be the case with the Find X9 Pro. However, it’s still technically impressive. With a new 1/1.28 sensor codeveloped with Sony, the 50MP main camera can capture triple exposures on each frame before merging them. Oppo claims that it gives images 17 stops of dynamic range. There’s also a fourth camera, a True Color camera, dedicated to precisely measuring color temperatures across all the other sensors. Combined, it’s an impressive system, but you’ll get the most out of it if you’re willing to pay for the additional teleconverter.</p>

<p>At £1,099 in the UK, Oppo has priced it identically to the iPhone 17 Pro, although we&#39;re still waiting to hear pricing for the teleconverter kit. I feared foldable prices, but this seems at least competitive here in Europe.</p>
<p>What’s stopping Oppo from breaking into the US? Trade turbulence and competition, probably. If it can refine the experience (and maybe keep its next phone compatible with the same teleconverter), it has a good chance at charming the obsessive smartphone photographer away from their iPhones and Pixels.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oppos-find-x9-pro-hands-on-detachable-telephoto-lens-7000mah-battery-160006373.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The simplest way to end your HBO Max subscription is if you&#39;re being billed directly by the company. You can follow these steps in a web or mobile browser to say goodbye to the house that Tony Soprano built.</p>

<p>That was pretty dang easy, but things get a bit more complicated if you originally subscribed via a third-party platform.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-via-third-party-provider">How to cancel via third-party provider</h2>
<p>Like most modern streaming platforms, HBO Max has partnerships with third-party providers like Apple and Amazon. This lets users sign up for the service through a totally different platform, like Prime Video or directly through iOS. Cancelling has to also go through this third party. The basic idea here is to sign into that account and find a place to manage billing and subscriptions, looking for HBO Max. Here are specific steps for some of the more common providers.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-cancel-via-apple">Cancel via Apple</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to the Settings app on your iOS device.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap on your name at the top of the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap Subscriptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Select HBO Max to manage and make changes.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jump-link-cancel-via-amazon">Cancel via Amazon</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to Amazon in a web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign in to your account.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Amazon Memberships and Subscriptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the HBO Max subscription and hit Cancel Subscription.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the prompts.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jump-link-cancel-via-google-play">Cancel via Google Play</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to the Google Play store on a web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that you&#39;re signed in to your Google account.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Payment &amp; Subscriptions, which should be on the top right.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Subscriptions tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Select HBO Max.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Manage.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Cancel Subscription.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-cancel-a-bundle-subscription">How to cancel a bundle subscription</h2>
<p>There are a couple of bundles that include HBO Max, in addition to platforms like Disney+ and Hulu. It&#39;s corporate synergy at its finest. However, this does make cancelling slightly more complicated. If you previously had an HBO Max subscription and upgraded to a bundle, cancelling the bundle might not cancel HBO Max. It could just cancel the platforms that were added in the bundle. Just make sure to double-check that HBO Max went away along with the bundle. As for canceling the bundle itself, follow the steps above.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-can-i-pause-an-hbo-max-subscription">Can I pause an HBO Max subscription?</h2>
<p>No, you can&#39;t pause a subscription to HBO Max. The best way to approximate this is to simply cancel a subscription and resubscribe at a later date. Whatever works, right?</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-happens-after-you-cancel">What happens after you cancel?</h2>
<p>Cancelling your subscription to HBO Max doesn&#39;t immediately end the service. There are no partial refunds in this world, so you&#39;ll have full access to the account until the next payment date. This means that if you change your mind before the next pay period, it&#39;ll be easy to get things going again. Just look for a Restart Subscription button somewhere on the Account page. After the next payment date passes, the service sails off into that Westeros sunset.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/how-to-cancel-your-hbo-max-subscription-155047857.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The BBC has today <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/doctor-who-future-confirmed-new-christmas-special-2026">announced</a> <em>Doctor Who</em> will return for a Christmas Special in 2026, with news of the next series to be revealed “in due course.” The broadcaster says the special will be written by current executive producer Russell T. Davies, putting to rest more than a year’s worth of doubt.</p>
<p>For the unaware, <em>Doctor Who</em> has been a mainstay in the BBC schedules since its 2005 revival, but the BBC felt it couldn’t sustain the show’s budget alone. In 2022, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/doctor-who-disney-plus-2023-150040129.html">it partnered with Disney</a>, which bankrolled the show in exchange for the right to stream it globally on Disney+.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Disney deal lasted for two years, plus the yet-to-be-broadcast spin-off <em>The War Between The Land And The Sea</em>. Unfortunately, the revived series was not the world-swallowing hit its backers were hoping for, and there were big question marks about the show’s future.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes rumors suggested an unhappy set, with the companion role recast just weeks before production began on the second season. With the show’s fate uncertain, the series’ long-running storyline was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/12-thoughts-about-that-doctor-who-finale-150032038.html">tweaked and re-shot beyond the point of incoherence</a> as star Ncuti Gatwa opted to leave.</p>
<p>Since then, more details about the series&#39; originally planned conclusion have leaked out, as reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/carole-ann-ford-doctor-who-return-originally-meant/"><em>Den of Geek</em></a>, validating the stories of disharmony. And since then, many figures connected to the show have claimed that the series was dead in the water as the BBC lacks the funds to properly afford it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news of a new special and new season will, naturally, provoke plenty more questions as to how the BBC will be able to keep the show going, and how Davies will be able to un-tangle the knot he hastily tied at the conclusion of &quot;The Reality War.&quot;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a former Twitter user still using <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-testing-a-new-way-of-opening-links-in-posts-to-improve-engagement-211210520.html"><ins>X</ins></a> and rely on a hardware security key for your two-factor authentication (2FA) method, you need to re-enroll it before November 10. As spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807011/twitter-com-x-com-login-security-key-passkey-domain"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, X’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Safety"><ins>Safety</ins></a> account notified users of the deadline in a post last week. The Elon Musk-owned company eventually intends to retire the twitter.com domain, which hardware keys such as YubiKeys remain tied to until they’re re-enrolled.</p>
<p>&quot;By November 10, we’re asking all accounts that use a security key as their two factor authentication (2FA) method to re-enroll their key to continue accessing X. You can re-enroll your existing security key, or enroll a new one. A reminder: if you enroll a new security key, any other security keys will stop working (unless also re-enrolled),&quot; the account said.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>X later clarified that the change only applies to YubiKeys and passkeys, and not 2FA authenticator apps such as Microsoft Authenticator or Authy. Users who fail to re-enroll their affected keys before November 10 will have their accounts locked until they either complete the re-enrollment process, choose a different 2FA method or decide to not use 2FA altogether (which X says it advises against).</p>
<p>To re-enroll your hardware key or add a new one, head to Settings in the X app, then click &quot;Security and account access&quot; and &quot;Manage Passkeys&quot; within the Security section.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has announced an approximately <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction">14,000 person reduction</a> in its corporate workforce. The news follows an earlier <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/">report from <em>Reuters</em></a> that up to 30,000 people could be let go. Amazon has confirmed to <em>Engadget</em> that the 14,000 roles were eliminated today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon declined to comment on which departments are impacted, but <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amzn-amazon-to-cut-14-000-jobs-across-corporate-workforce?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that layoffs occurred within teams such as video games, logistics, payments and cloud-computing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The impetus for this reduction is, of course, AI. In the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction">announcement</a>, Beth Galetti, Amazon&#39;s senior vice president of people experience and technology, states that Amazon is &quot;performing well&quot; but &quot;that the world is changing quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Galetti continues: &quot;This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it&#39;s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon has executed a series of smaller scale layoffs regularly over the past few years. These layoffs have hit a range of departments, including <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-laying-off-several-hundred-employees-at-prime-video-and-mgm-studios-161307199.html">Prime Video</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-to-close-quebec-facilities-but-says-its-not-because-of-that-new-union-185744378.html">newly unionized warehouse workers</a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has completed its long, drawn-out reorganization into a public benefit corporation, the company announced today in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;slk:blog post;" href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">blog post</a> attributed to board of directors chair Bret Taylor. As part of the reorg, OpenAI's nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, will retain control of OpenAI's for-profit division and hold an equity stake in the company valued at approximately $130 billion. According to Taylor, the Foundation will gain additional control over the for-profit once it reaches an unspecified "valuation milestone."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today's announcement wouldn't have been possible without acquiescence from Microsoft, which before OpenAI recently raised more startup capital, held a 32 percent stake in the company's for-profit unit.

Now that there's an agreement in place, it appears both sides made some tough compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, for instance, will continue to hold IP rights to OpenAI's models and products through 2032, with those rights covering systems the company develops after declaring artificial general intelligence. On the subject of AGI, the two companies will hire an independent panel of experts to verify any claim OpenAI makes there, when and if it reaches that milestone.</p>
<p>However, Microsoft has agreed to waive any IP rights as they relate to OpenAI's upcoming consumer hardware — that is, the devices the company is <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-buys-jony-ives-design-startup-for-65-billion-173356962.html">working on with former Apple designer Jony Ive</a>. In exchange, OpenAI has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure cloud computing services — though Microsoft also agreed it would no longer have a "right of first refusal" to be OpenAI's cloud provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, the most important part of today’s announcement is that it clears the way for OpenAI to become a publicly traded company. Much of the company’s financial future depended on it successfully completing this transition, and now at least it doesn’t have that burden resting on its shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-completes-corporate-reorganization-with-support-from-microsoft-133109385.html?src=rss]]></description>

NVIDIA <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/">describes</a> sovereign AI as &quot;a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks.&quot; The company&#39;s products will power Lux and Discovery, which will be built by Hewlett Packard Enterprises and will become the DoE&#39;s flagship supercomputers under the Trump administration&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/trumps-ai-action-plan-targets-state-regulation-and-ideological-bias-163247225.html">AI Action Plan</a>. AMD says the supercomputers&#39; development is made possible by a $1 billion investment from private and public funding and that they will help researchers tackle the biggest challenges in energy, medicine, health, and national security.</p>
<p>The Lux supercomputer will be powered by AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Pensando advanced networking technologies. DoE plans to deploy it sometime in 2026, and AMD says that would make Lux the first US AI Factory supercomputer. Lux would fulfill the agency&#39;s immediate AI needs and will give the US &quot;an early and decisive advantage&quot; when it comes to deploying AI to accelerate scientific innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>AMD is also working on the Discovery supercomputer with the same organizations, which will be powered by next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs that are codenamed &quot;Venice.&quot; It will be equipped with AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs, a new MI400 Series accelerator made specifically for sovereign AI and high-performance computing. &quot;The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before,&quot; said Oak Ridge director Stephen Streiffer. They&#39;re hoping for Discovery to become operational in 2029 and expect it to produce scientific and security breakthroughs, such as how to make nuclear energy safer and cheaper.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Among the usual slew of AI enhancements to its Creative Cloud apps, Adobe has introduced a new Photoshop AI Assistant to help automate repetitive chores and provide personalized recommendations. At <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://max.adobe.com/">Adobe Max 2025</a>, the company also introduced new tools for Photoshop, Premiere and Lightroom, while launching a new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adobe;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=73e6d253-5a10-4f58-b539-815233e32f36&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b944c534-dfd7-4f2b-bbb3-5b998b0bfe79&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adobe&amp;linkText=AI+generative+model&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vYWkvb3ZlcnZpZXcvZmlyZWZseS9nZW4tYWktYXBwcm9hY2guaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjk0NGM1MzQtZGZkNy00ZjJiLWJiYjMtNWI5OThiMGJmZTc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vYWkvb3ZlcnZpZXcvZmlyZWZseS9nZW4tYWktYXBwcm9hY2guaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ6I-reOClLVZkDKpW06FsqZ61tTEwM68tzMMm1w1L5Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fai%2Foverview%2Ffirefly%2Fgen-ai-approach.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/firefly/gen-ai-approach.html">AI generative model</a> and bringing in new third party models from Topaz and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key new feature in Photoshop and Express (Adobe&#39;s all-in-one design, photo, and video tool) is the AI Assistant that lets you can chat with in a conversational manner to gain &quot;more control, power and potential time-savings,&quot; according to Adobe. With that, you can tell it to take on a series of creative tasks like color correction on resizing. You can easily switch between prompts with the agent and manual tools like sliders to adjust brightness and contrast. It can also provide personalized recommendations and offer tutorials on how to accomplish complex tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a brief demo, Adobe showed that when you switch to Photoshop&#39;s &quot;agentic&quot; mode in those apps, it minimizes the usual complex interface and leaves you with a simple prompt-based UI. You can then type in the task you want to accomplish, and the agent will perform those steps automatically. You can then jump back into the full interface to fine tune the result by changing things like brightness or levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the AI Assistant, Adobe introduced a few other AI tools for Photoshop. Chief among those are new partner models for generative fill that lets you easily remove unwanted objects and fill in the hole left behind. Those include Google Gemini 2.5 f!ash, Black Forest Labs FLUX.1 Kontext and Adobe&#39;s latest Firefly Image Models. It also introduced Firefly Image Model 5, Adobe&#39;s most advanced image generation model yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photoshop also gains new Generative Upscale option that uses Topaz Lab&#39;s AI to upscale small, cropped and other low-resolution images into 4K with &quot;realistic detail,&quot; Adobe says. Another feature, Harmonize, lets you place objects or people into different environments in a realistic manner, eliminating much of work necessary for such compositing. Harmonize also matches the light, color and tone of foreground objects and people to the background.</p>

<p>Premiere, meanwhile, introduced a similar feature called AI Object Mask that performs automatic identification and isolation of people and objects in video, so they can be edited and tracked without any manual rotoscoping. The app also gains new rectangle, ellipse and pen masking in Premiere to make targeted adjustments, along with a fast vector mask for quicker tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, LIghtroom is getting a new feature called Assisted Culling. It lets you quickly and easily identify the best images in a large photo collection, with the ability to filter for things like focus level, angles and degrees of sharpness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photoshop’s Generative Fill with Partner Models, Generative Upscale and Harmonize are now available to customers today. Premiere’s AI Object Mask, Rectangle, Ellipse and Pen Masking and Fast Vector Mask, along with Lightroom&#39;s AI Assisted Culling, launch today in beta. Adobe&#39;s Photoshop AI Assistant, meanwhile, will be available through a private beta waitlist.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/adobes-new-photoshop-ai-assistant-can-automate-repetitive-tasks-120032017.html?src=rss]]></description>

The updated app can now use AI to generate narration, music, images and video clips, while even helping you to brainstorm ideas and piece together clips. Many creators may find it distasteful to lean on AI for nearly every aspect of production, but Adobe calls it "a tool for, not a replacement of, human creativity."</p>
<p>Firefly has mostly been a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-previews-ai-video-tools-that-arrive-later-this-year-172021715.html">content generation tool</a> until now, but Adobe has now introduced the Firefly video editor into private beta. It's a web-based multitrack timeline editor, not unlike Adobe Premiere Pro, that lets you generate, organize, trim and arrange clips, with tools to add voiceovers, soundtracks and titles. You can organize existing Firefly content or generate new ones inside the editor (with presets  like claymation, anime and 2D), and combine that with captured media. All that can be edited with "frame-by-frame precision or through a built-in transcript," Adobe said.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of video, Firefly eliminates the need for humans to make voiceovers and music, too. Adobe's new Generate Soundtrack (public beta) is a Firefly Audio Model-powered AI music generator that lets you select a style or comes up with one to match any clip you upload. It then syncs and times it precisely with that footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generate Speech, meanwhile, does the same thing for voiceovers. It gives you a choice between Firefly's Speech Model and one for ElevenLabs, letting you generate "lifelike voices in multiple languages, and fine-tune emotion, pacing and emphasis for natural, expressive delivery."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adobe is also expanding access to its <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://business.adobe.com/products/firefly-business/firefly-creative-production.html">Fire!y Creative Production tool</a> directly in the Fire!y app as a private beta to start with. It's a complete AI-powered batch image editing system that lets creators piece together clips, automatically replace backgrounds, apply uniform color grading and crop in via a prompt-driven, no code interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there's Fire!y Boards, an "AI-powered ideation surface" to brainstorm new concepts. A feature called "Rotate Object" helps you convert 2D images into 3D so you can position objects and people in different poses and rotate them to new perspectives. Two others, PDF exporting and bulk image downloading, speed the the process of sharing visual concepts across projects.</p>
<p>Finally, Prompt to Edit (available now on Firefly) is a conversational editing interface that allows you to use everyday language to describe the edits you want to make to an image, much as you'd use text-to-image tools like Midjourney to create new images. It's available with Adobe's latest Fire!y Image Model 5 AI, along with partner models from Black Forest Labs, Google and OpenAI.</p>
<p>With Firefly's AI now able to handle every aspect of production, you may be wondering if this will result in a wave of unwatchable <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-now-has-a-feed-for-ai-slop-205751808.html">AI "slop"</a> appearing on YouTube and elsewhere. The answer is "probably," but it won't necessarily be cheap. Standalone Firefly subscriptions are  $10/month for the basic plan (20 five-second videos), $20/month for the the Pro plan (40 five-second videos) and $199 for the Premium plan (unlimited videos). However, Adobe is throwing in free image and video generation (with some restrictions) for all Firefly and Creative Cloud Pro customers until December 1st. All the new tools are now available either as part of the update, in public beta or in private beta as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/adobes-firefly-can-now-use-ai-to-generate-soundtracks-speech-and-video-120018593.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Insta360 has launched a new camera that sits between the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/insta360-x4-release-date-price-first-impressions-130001066.html">X4</a> and its current flagship, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x5-launch-date-price-hands-on-132439941.html">X5</a>. The company says the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e2f64efd-a8dc-4a99-9b82-d22ee2531593&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Insta360+X4+Air&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmluc3RhMzYwLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3g0LWFpciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTJmNjRlZmQtYThkYy00YTk5LTliODItZDIyZWUyNTMxNTkzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmluc3RhMzYwLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3g0LWFpciJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbqT8VH-xUu-QKQgAtSqYwsA8YXi9sMimZ2ujtr4ujsX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.insta360.com%2Fproduct%2Fx4-air" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://store.insta360.com/product/x4-air">Insta360 X4 Air</a> is lightest-ever 8K 360-degree camera at just 165 grams. It is definitely lighter than the 200-gram X5 and the 203-gram X4 cameras, but the company says it packs flagship-level features. The camera has 1/1.8-inch sensors and can capture footage with a 134 percent increase in pixel area per frame compared to recording by the X4. It has lenses that users can replace in seconds, with optical coating that doubles its drop resistance compared to its predecessor. The camera is also waterproof up to 49 feet underwater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company explained that while the &quot;X5 is engineered for precision, X4 Air is made for freedom.&quot; It&#39;s compatible with most X5 accessories, but since the camera itself is lighter, the whole setup will still be easier to handle. The X4 Air also has a built-in wind guard like the X5 and captures footage from every angle with its dual fisheye lenses. You can later reframe your footage in the Insta360 app to give your viewers various perspectives of what you shot. It has gesture controls and other intelligent tools the X5 also has, and its Invisible Selfie Stick enables drone-like shots like in other Insta360 cameras. Being lighter, however, means it has a battery with a lower capacity: It can last around 88 minutes while shooting at 8K 30fps, whereas the X5 can last up to 100 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://max.adobe.com/">Adobe Max</a> kicked off today with a slew of announcements — mostly in the world of AI. But the company also used its creative conference to share that Adobe Premiere&#39;s video editing tools are being integrated into YouTube Shorts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that YouTube has been taking <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-its-photo-to-video-tech-to-youtube-shorts-160033683.html">every step</a> it can to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-shorts-can-now-run-up-to-three-minutes-160002081.html">make Shorts compete</a> with TikTok and Instagram Reels. Now, YouTube creators will be able to access Premiere mobile in Shorts by clicking on &quot;Edit in Adobe Premiere.&quot; It will include Adobe&#39;s editing tools, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-firefly-can-now-generate-sound-effects-from-your-audio-cues-130008172.html">generative sound effects</a> and, of course, a range of AI features powered by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobes-firefly-generative-ai-app-is-now-available-on-mobile-130055044.html">Firefly</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube Shorts creators will also see &quot;exclusive&quot; options like a range of effects, presets and transitions. Similarly, they can choose to go for an existing template designed for Shorts or customize ones that can be shared among creators. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/adobe-premiere-is-coming-to-ios-later-this-month-155019427.html">Adobe Premiere arrived on iOS devices</a> in September, but creators have to export content to YouTube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a statement, Adobe&#39;s chief technology officer and senior vice president of digital media, Ely Greenfield, referred to YouTube as &quot;the world&#39;s biggest stage.&quot; He continued, &quot;YouTube Shorts has become the ultimate launchpad for creators, and bringing Adobe Premiere mobile’s pro-grade video editing tools to millions of YouTube creators helps them make standout content and reach new audiences.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact timeframe isn&#39;t clear, with Adobe simply saying that Premiere mobile is coming to YouTube Shorts &quot;soon.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-shorts-will-integrate-adobe-premieres-video-editing-tools-120013562.html?src=rss]]></description>

That meant reduced performance in exchange for increased portability. However, there will always be enthusiasts who want more: increased horsepower, better battery life and all sorts of extra features. Out of all the handhelds on the market today, there's practically no device with more tools and special equipment than the Lenovo Legion Go 2. However, just like a luxury SUV, this bucket of components commands a hefty premium and has capabilities that you might not use every day. But if you are the type of person who's looking for a flagship portable PC with all the bells and whistles, the Legion Go 2 is a true utility gaming handheld.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="8f364b18-a244-43d1-a4fe-15ef2f834945">Design</h2> 
<p>The Legion Go 2 looks like a Switch 2 that's fattened up before hibernating for the winter. It has the same basic design with detachable controllers on either side and a screen in the middle; it's just way bigger and bulkier. The Legion Go 2 weighs two pounds and measures 11.6 inches wide (with its controllers attached) compared to 1.6 pounds and 11.4 inches for the ROG Xbox Ally X (and that's including its big, pronounced grips). Both devices make the Switch 2 look downright petite with its&nbsp; 1.2 pounds and 10.7-inch-wide frame.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, without the magnets that Nintendo uses on the Joy-Con, disconnecting the gamepads on the Legion Go 2 isn't nearly as smooth or easy, but it's still relatively manageable. On the flipside, Lenovo uses Hall Effect sensors for its joysticks, which makes them super responsive, even though they're lighter to push around. I appreciate that, unlike many of its rivals, Lenovo kept the kickstand from its predecessor, as it's super handy if you want to prop the Legion Go 2 up and use it like a mini desktop.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, there is a familiar layout for the Legion Go 2’s D-pad, face buttons and shoulder triggers/bumpers, along with two pairs of paddles around back. Critically, Lenovo retained the built-in touchpad on the right controller, which is super handy for those times when you need to mouse around in the Windows 11 desktop. And like its predecessor, you can detach the right gamepad, flick the hidden switch on the bottom into FPS mode and then combine it with Lenovo's included base to create a vertical mouse of sorts. </p>

<p>Ostensibly, this setup is meant for people who want extra precision in shooters and there is even an extra set of mouse buttons and an embedded scroll wheel on the controller for that reason. The one hiccup for me is that the puck isn't that much smaller than a typical travel mouse. If I really want ultimate control in FPS games, I'm going to use one of those instead of Lenovo's more awkward alternative.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for connectivity, the Legion Go 2 features two USB-C ports (one on top and one on bottom) which support data (up to 40 Gbps), power delivery and display output. There's also a microSD card slot for expandable storage and a 3.5mm audio jack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have two small nitpicks with the Legion Go 2's design (aside from its size). First, the headphone port is on the bottom, which isn't ideal as I feel like the top USB-C connector is easier to use when gaming while plugged into the wall. Secondly, Lenovo's fingerprint reader (which is built into the power button) is rather finicky. I didn't have issues unlocking the device, but the sensor is so sensitive that often when I pressed the power button to put the Legion Go 2 into sleep mode, the screen turned off before turning itself on again. This resulted in multiple occasions where I thought I put the handheld to sleep inside the included case (kudos to Lenovo for that freebie) only to come back to a device that was very much awake and felt like it was on the verge of cooking itself inside its padded enclosure.&nbsp;</p>

</figure> 
<p>If money and size are not an issue, Lenovo's massive OLED display is the biggest reason to choose the Legion Go 2 over rivals like the ROG Xbox Ally X. At 8.8 inches, it's significantly larger than the 7-inch panel on the ASUS or the 7.9-inch screen on a Switch 2. Not only are its colors super rich and saturated, it has a slightly higher 144Hz refresh rate and a taller 16:10 resolution (1,920 x 1,200). And at 500 nits, it's just as bright as the screen on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The downside is that if you want to game at the Legion Go 2's native res, it does take a little bit of extra performance to achieve stable, playable framerates.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="de0ca091-3641-487f-bc37-1363b6b6cdb3">Performance and software</h2> 
<p>The $1,100 base model of the Legion Go 2 comes with an AMD Ryzen Z2 chip with 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage. However, if you want even better performance, you'll need to upgrade to the $1,350 version that comes with a Z2 Extreme chip and 32GB of RAM, which is the configuration I tested for this review. Frankly, that is a lot of money to drop on a gaming handheld of any kind, though the Legion Go 2 does make up for it with class-leading performance. Well, almost.</p>

<p>While the maxed SKUs of both the Legion Go 2 and ROG Xbox Ally x are based on the same Z2 Extreme chip, Microsoft was able to tweak some of Windows 11's tasks and services that run in the background on Lenovo’s' rival. And while there isn't a huge gap between the two, that optimization does make a difference.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Generally, the ROG Xbox Ally produced framerates that were around seven percent higher than what I got from the Legion Go 2 at the same graphics settings and resolution. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp; at 35 watts on medium, 1080p resolution and FSR set to performance, the Legion Go 2 hit 57.5 fps compared to 62.1 fps for the ROG Xbox Ally X. Meanwhile in <em>Returnal </em>at 17 watts on medium, the Lenovo reached 39 fps versus 42 for ASUS. Depending on the game and the exact resolution you're using, that could mean the difference between something being a good experience or not. For example, in <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> at 1080p on medium, the ROG Xbox Ally X hovered right around 30 fps. Granted, that isn't ideal, but it's not bad for a handheld running a relatively new title. But on the Legion Go 2 at its native res, its average framerate was closer to 25 fps, which forced me to drop down to low settings to get a smoother experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like a lot of Windows-based handhelds, it's important to remember that you get more speed when connected to a power outlet. For example, the Legion Go 2's Performance mode tops out at 20 watts when not plugged in, but increases to 32 watts when it is. And if you want to go all out, you're best off using the Custom setting, which gives you a sustained TDP of 35 watts and the ability to boost to 45 watts for up to 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for the software, Lenovo's Legion Space app has come a long way and it's turned into a solid one-stop shop for launching games, adjusting settings and tweaking performance. As always with Windows-based handhelds, there's still a bit of awkwardness during setup when you're installing titles and having to switch between various menus. Thankfully, Lenovo's built-in touchpad helps smooth that out quite a bit. I'd also argue that because of that trackpad and the handheld's adaptable design, the Legion Go 2 is the most well-equipped portable for anyone who wants to use it like a mini PC. You can prop the display up with its kickstand, connect a display via USB-C and pair a wireless keyboard and mouse (or use the right controller in FPS mode) and suddenly you've got a little desktop for getting some real work done. (Who are we kidding, this is still going to be used for gaming, just on a bigger display with better controls.)</p> 
<h2 id="861d7f02-c9aa-411b-9822-a35c268bcb67">Battery Life</h2>

<p>Thanks to a 74WHr cell and a more efficient chip, the Legion Go 2 has gotten a nice bump battery life over its predecessor. However, due to its big display, its longevity isn't quite as good compared to the ROG Xbox Ally X. I tested this by playing <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> at 1080p on medium graphics and max brightness. The Legion Go 2 did well, lasting almost three hours, though that was 30 minutes shy of what I got from the ROG Xbox Ally X. While you can game for a decent length of time untethered, for any longer trips or time away from an outlet, you'll definitely want to keep the included 65-watt power adapter close at hand.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="1db8b028-b8e1-420f-b677-f8cb75056b2b">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>The Lenovo Legion Go 2 is large and in charge — both in price and size. The base model starts at $1,100, which is already $100 more than a fully kitted-out <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip. Meanwhile, to get the same silicon on Lenovo's handheld, you have to shell out $1,350, and even then, its performance still lags just a tad behind Microsoft and ASUS' collab. But what the Legion Go 2 lacks in value, it makes up for in versatility.</p>

<p>Its 8.8-inch OLED display is a huge upgrade in terms of both screen space and image quality, while features like its touchpad, detachable controllers and kickstand make this thing feel more like a portable hybrid PC than a single-purpose gaming machine. Just like an SUV that might go off-road once or twice a year, you might not use the Legion Go 2's full capabilities all the time, but when you do and everything comes together, you realize all that utility isn't just for show. While the ROG Xbox Ally X is the better value, I appreciate how Lenovo's handheld was made to handle a variety of battle conditions.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spinning off from Rivian, the TM-B e-bike is Also’s attempt at a do-it-all e-bike. It’s pitching it as flexible enough for commuting, trail riding or kid- and cargo-hauling because its modular frame can swap in bench seats or cargo racks. But the frame only comes in a single size. Still, Also (hate that name) says the standard battery is good for 60 miles of riding and can be charged via USB-C.</p>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-first-e-bike-from-rivian-spinoff-also-has-a-virtual-drivetrain-173000250.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/60cd8d70-b3e2-11f0-b575-d427a31cf740" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/60cd8d70-b3e2-11f0-b575-d427a31cf740" style="height:427px;width:640px;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="18261765-a908-3692-8704-d0589d729c4f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a>
<p>Besides the modularity, another unique feature is its drive system, called DreamRide. Instead of a mechanical connection between the bike’s rear wheel and the pedals, the TM-B uses “software-defined pedaling,” so pedaling transfers to the generator (and the battery) instead of simply pushing you forward. It’s a different take on e-bike riding, and I’m not entirely sold on it.</p>
<p>From the people that brought you Rivian vehicles, there are plenty more tech touches, including a 5-inch touchscreen display and a built-in security system that automatically locks the frame and rear wheel when you walk away, a la Cowboy and VanMoof.</p>
<p>The first model to ship will be the $4,500 TM-B Limited Launch Edition, which has a range of up to 100 miles. There’s also a $4,500 TM-B Performance model, with a slightly different color scheme, available in the “first half” of 2026. Finally, there’s a base-level TM-B model with a range of up to 60 miles, which only comes with standard ride modes. Also hasn’t announced an exact price but says it will cost less than $4,000 when it ships “later in 2026.”</p>

<p>A preview version of Google’s long-awaited AI health coach launches tomorrow for some Fitbit Premium users in the US. Google says it’ll incorporate user feedback to “add, change or improve features and capabilities.” The company warns users that “initially, there will be some gaps” as it sort of beta tests the coach. The coach can be a sounding board for personal health, fitness and sleep goals and also acts as a personal trainer. Google says it can check progress, create workouts, give advice on trends and review and adjust fitness plans.</p>

<p>The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) submitted a new measure that allows it — for facial recognition — to photograph any non-US citizen who enters or exits the country. CBP and the Department of Homeland Security want to crack down on threats of terrorism, fraudulent use of travel documents and anyone who exceeds their authorized stay, according to a filing with the government’s Federal Register. The government agency can already request photos and fingerprints from anyone entering the country, but this rule change would allow it to gather photos of anyone exiting as well.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the excitement around 2-in-1 systems has cooled a bit over the years, they’re still useful solutions for anyone who wants a device that can act as both a tablet <em>and</em> a traditional laptop. In tablet mode, they’re handy for jotting down notes and drawing pictures, and in their full laptop configurations, they can let you manage e-mail and write as you would with a traditional notebook. Whether you’re a student, creative or just want a more flexible setup, a 2-in-1 solution gives you the best of both worlds without having to carry multiple devices.<br><br>We've tested and reviewed some of the top 2-in-1 options out there from brands like HP, Microsoft, Samsung and Apple. Whether you’re looking for a Windows PC that can occasionally act like a tablet, or traditional slates that can be empowered with keyboard accessories, we’ve rounded up the best models to consider.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-2-in-1-laptop">Factors to consider before buying a 2-in-1 laptop</h2> 
<p>When you’re shopping for a 2-in-1 system, there are some basic criteria to keep in mind. First off, consider the type of machine you’re looking for. Do you want something that can look like a traditional Windows laptop, but also has a screen that can twist into different orientations? (We often call these convertibles.) Or do you want a standalone tablet that works with a separate keyboard attachment? Tablet setups are typically lighter, but they’re often harder to use on your lap since they rely on kickstands or awkward cases.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Also, while some 2-in-1s offer built-in LTE or 5G connectivity, not everyone will want to pay the premium for it. An integrated cellular radio makes checking emails or replying to messages on the go far more convenient. But it also often costs more — and that’s on top of what you’ll pay for data. And as for 5G, you can hold off on it unless you live within range of a mmWave beacon. Coverage is still spotty and existing nationwide networks use the slower sub-6 technology that’s barely faster than LTE. For now, tethering a PC to your phone is still the best way to get online.</p> 
<p>When it comes to tablet keyboards, you’ll also have to make peace with the fact that they’ll never feel as responsive as full-fledged laptop options. Their keys are shallower, and their layouts are often a bit different than typical PCs. Again, there’s a cost for portability.</p>

<p>Sometimes, getting a third-party tablet keyboard might be just as good, and they’re often cheaper than first-party offerings.

<p>While we’ve typically made sure to include a budget 2-in-1 in previous years, this time there isn’t a great choice. We would usually pick a Surface Go, but the latest model is still too expensive. Other alternatives, like cheaper Android tablets, are underpowered and don’t offer a great multitasking interface. If you want something around $500 that’s thin, lightweight and long-lasting, you’re better off this year looking at a traditional laptop (like those on <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">our best budget PCs list</a>).

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-wireless-headphones-for-you">How to choose the best wireless headphones for you</h2> 
<p>When it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>The next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">Bluetooth</a> multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.</p> 
<p>Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html">Spatial Audio</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html">Dolby Atmos</a>, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-over-ear-headphones">How we test over-ear headphones</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> 
<p>To judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.</p> 
<p>When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-wireless-headphones-we-tested">Other wireless headphones we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-airpods-max">AirPods Max</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dyson-on-trac">Dyson On-Trac</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sonos-ace">Sonos Ace</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-ult-wear">Sony ULT Wear</h3> 
<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sony-wh-ch720n">Sony WH-CH720N</h3> 
<p>While the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-ch720n-review-160032871.html">WH-CH720N</a> are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-beats-studio-pro">Beats Studio Pro</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</h3> 
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review-a-new-spin-on-a-reliable-formula-160009025.html">Bose’s latest flagship model</a> has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> 
<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">here</a>, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wireless-headphones-faqs">Wireless headphones FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-can-you-tell-the-quality-of-wireless-headphones">How can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-choose-the-best-quality-wireless-headphones">How do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-brand-has-the-best-wireless-headphones">Which brand has the best wireless headphones?</h3> 
<p>Sony consistently tops our list with <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">its 1000X line</a>. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">like Bose</a>, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-expensive-wireless-headphones-sound-better">Do expensive wireless headphones sound better?</h3> 
<p>Exorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. <a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html">Bowers &amp; Wilkins’</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html">headphones</a> are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html">Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2</a> is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss]]></description>
