Meta&#39;s boss also announced the second generation Ray-Ban Meta, as well as a pair of Oakley-branded sunglasses designed for athletes. In addition, Zuckerberg launched Horizon TV, a new entertainment hub for the Quest headsets, which will give you easy access to Disney+, Prime Video and other streaming services in virtual reality. Here&#39;s everything you might have missed.</p>

The model is equipped with a 12-megapixel camera that can capture videos in 3K Ultra HD, with up to 60 frames per second and HDR support, as well as 32GB of storage. This fall, Meta will also roll out updates that will bring hyperlapse and slow-motion video capture to all its glasses, including this one. The Gen 2 Ray-Ban Meta glasses are now available with the same three base frames as their predecessor, namely Wayfarer, Skyler and Headliner, and will cost you at least $379.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the original <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-are-the-smart-glasses-athletes-might-actually-want-001511094.html">Oakley Meta glasses</a>, the Vanguard was clearly designed to cater to athletes. It features the wraparound frames Oakley is known for, with reflective swappable lens in different colors. Due to how it curves around the face, Meta placed its 12-megapixel camera in the center of the frames so that helmets and hats don&#39;t ruin your shots. The camera on this model has a wider 122-degree angle lens and adjustable video stabilization so that you can still take videos while moving. Meta told us that the device&#39;s battery was optimized for a wider range of temperatures, as well, allowing it to hold up better in harsh environments. In addition to the better battery life, the Vanguard also has louder onboard speakers and will come with integrations for Strava and Garmin.

Its lenses function as translucent heads-up displays (HUD) that can show you texts, AI prompts, turn-by-turn pedestrian navigation and video calls. The dedicated EMG wristband it&#39;s paired with will allow you to interact with the HUD&#39;s interface and will even give you the ability to type out responses. Video calling didn&#39;t work properly during its on-stage demo, but Zuckerberg was able to play a song on Spotify, demonstrate a real-time subtitle feature that could be a huge help for those with hearing impairments, as well as capture and view images. The Meta Ray-Ban Display will be available through a limited number of brick-and-mortar stores, including Best Buy, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban and Verizon, since you&#39;ll have to be fitted for the wristband. You&#39;ll be able to get it for $799 starting on September 30 in the US and starting early next year in Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A simple experiment can tell you whether an ergonomic keyboard could be more comfortable for you: With your elbows hugged into your sides, bring your thumbs to touch in front of you. Now angle your elbows slightly outward and separate your hands. If the latter position feels better, you may appreciate the design of an ergonomic keyboard. These boards split, tilt and/or angle the keys in so your shoulders and chest feel more open and your forearms and wrists stay aligned.<br><br>Some ergonomic keyboards are fully split, some are unibody split (Alice designs). Some use a columnar orientation, have thumb clusters and take advantage of programmable keys. I tried more than 15 with a mix of all these features and included info about the benefits of various designs so you can pick the best ergonomic keyboard for you (because it won’t be the same for everyone).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ergonomic-keyboard">What to look for in an ergonomic keyboard</h2> 
<p>You might be looking into ergonomic accessories to help with a specific problem, such as carpal tunnel or tendonitis. Or maybe you’re simply looking for a way to make long hours at your desk more comfortable. It can help to know some of the terminology and reasons behind various features, which we explain below. Just keep in mind that new equipment alone won’t solve the problem. Changing <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5618737/">positions</a>, doing regular <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox6NxmOpeLs">stretches</a> and taking <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/well/move/work-walk-5-minutes-work.html">walk breaks</a> will all go a long way towards making you feel better while you work.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-alice-vs-split"><strong>Alice vs split</strong></h3> 
<p>Most ergonomic keyboard layouts fall into two categories: unibody (or Alice) and split. The former is a single board with the two halves of the keys rotated about 30 degrees apart at the bottom. The separation forms an A-shaped space between the keys — which has nothing to do with why it’s called an Alice layout, it’s just a happy coincidence. This subtle tweak pushes your elbows away from your ribs while keeping a straight line from your forearm to your middle knuckle. Using one, I pretty instantly felt more open along the front side of my body. This layout more closely resembles a traditional keyboard, so it should be easier for most folks to get used to than a fully split option.</p> 
<p>Speaking of, split boards break the keys into two separate parts you can position individually. You can put them shoulder distance apart, bring them closer together or angle them as much as feels comfortable. You can also put your mouse between the halves, which may feel like an easier trip for your cursor hand and could potentially help with conditions like repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Personally, I like being able to put my current snack between the two parts. I've also found that pairing a split keyboard with <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ergonomic-mouse-120004931.html">a good ergonomic mouse</a> has helped me even more, particularly a vertical mouse.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tenkeyless"><strong>Tenkeyless</strong></h3> 
<p>You can find ergonomic keyboards with and without number pads. Not having those number keys on the right hand side lets you keep your mouse closer in, minimizing overall reach. But if you work with numbers a lot, you’ll likely want that pad included. Some programmable boards allow for the use of layers, which temporarily repurpose keys and can provide you with a ten-key option through clever remapping of letter keys.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tenting-and-negative-tilt"><strong>Tenting and negative tilt</strong></h3> 
<p>Tenting raises the middle of the keyboard up, so your hands move closer to a “handshake” position. Alice keyboards usually angle up towards the middle and always to a fixed degree, since the two sides are connected. Split boards often let you adjust the degree of tenting, going from flat to subtle to extreme lift.</p> 
<p>You may have encountered keyboards with an optional lift at the back of the board, raising the top keys higher than the space bar. Every set of hands is different, but for most people, pulling the backs of the hands towards the forearms increases strain. Negative tilt has the opposite effect by sloping in the other direction, lowering the top number keys while raising the edge with the spacebar. Many Alice and some split keyboards offer an optional negative tilt. I found it was more comfortable to enable that feature when I’m standing, and I preferred to have the keys flat when sat at my desk.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="3b244ab6-b9aa-41d6-97ae-72e4e29a296c" /> 
<h3 id="jump-link-staggered-vs-columnar"><strong>Staggered vs columnar</strong></h3> 
<p>This decision seems to be one of the more hotly-contested among ergo enthusiasts. A conventional keyboard has staggered keys, with each row slightly offset to the rows above and below it — so the A key is about halfway between the Q and W above it. This is a holdover from vintage mechanical typewriters, in which each press activated a hammer that smashed ink onto paper in the shape of a letter. To fit the hammers as close together as possible, while still allowing for finger pads, the keys were staggered.</p> 
<p>Columnar or ortholinear keyboards stack the keys in orderly columns, often with rows that are not linear. Proponents claim this makes the keys easier to reach. Whether that’s true will be up to your fingers to decide, but I can say for certain that if you learned to type on a staggered keyboard, switching to a columnar layout is tough. It will take days, possibly weeks before you instinctively hit the C key. The N, M and B keys don’t fare much better.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-programmable-keys"><strong>Programmable keys</strong></h3> 
<p>With a few exceptions, most ergonomic keyboards will work with PCs or Macs as a standard typing input, but the use of function and hot keys may require some remapping. It can be as easy as an onboard switch to toggle between Mac and PC layouts, or as involved as downloading software to change up the keys. Some boards even include (or let you buy) extra keycaps to change, say, the Mac’s Command and Option keys to PC’s Start and Alt buttons. Those are what's called hot-swappable keys, meaning you just pull the old key off (usually with a provided key puller) and stick the new one on, no soldering required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For some boards, remapping or programming keys using software is a crucial feature. Gaming peripherals have extra keys that you can set to execute a series of keystrokes with the push of a single button, and we <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-keyboard-140019954.html">cover the best gaming keyboards</a> in a separate guide. Keyboards that work with layers, in which a single button can perform several functions, typically allow you to change what those are. Some ergo keyboards have non-standard layouts, like thumb clusters with multiple keys near the space bar that you operate with your thumb. You’ll also be able to program those.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-other-considerations"><strong>Other considerations</strong></h3> 
<p>Ergonomic keyboards come in mechanical, membrane, and scissor switch versions. Which works best for you is, again, up to your preference. I won’t get too deep into the particulars here, as we have an entire guide <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mechanical-keyboard-120050723.html">devoted to the best mechanical boards</a>, but the short of it is that membrane and scissor switches are less customizable than mechanical and typically cheaper. Typing on them tends to be quieter and softer. Mechanical switches are more customizable, offer a more responsive typing experience and are usually pricier.</p> 
<p>You’ll also have the option of wired or wireless ergonomic boards. All other things being equal, wired models are less expensive. Competitive gamers who rely on split-second responses may prefer the zero-lag of wired keyboards. Wired models also never run out of battery life and have fewer connectivity issues. But wireless keyboards keep your desk less cluttered.</p> 
<p>Some ergonomic keyboards come with permanent or removable wrist or palm rests, which can be cushioned or hard. This is another area where opinions diverge: proponents claim they help you maintain a neutral hand position, while detractors say they put pressure on the tendons and can cause wrist pain or even exacerbate conditions like carpal tunnel. Ideally, your palms should be resting, not your wrists, and you might find you like having that support or you may find the pressure uncomfortable.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-ergonomic-keyboards"><strong>How we tested ergonomic keyboards</strong></h2> 
<p>All our guides begin with extensive research to figure out what’s out there and what’s worth testing. We consider brands with good reputations that we’ve heard good things about from colleagues and look at keyboard reviews in forums and other trusted publications. For this guide, I looked for keyboards with ergonomic features like tenting, split keys, palm support and so on. I also zeroed in on boards that didn’t require a deep amount of familiarity with the vast and exhaustive world of custom keyboards.</p> 
<p>Once I settled on ten boards, I acquired them and used each one for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. I tried out the remapping and macros software and considered the comfort, design, price and durability of each model before arriving at picks I think will work best for the most people out there. For subsequent updates to this guide, I have continued to acquire and test out new keyboards as they come on the market, adding and replacing the top picks as warranted. If and when Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, like the Sculpt, come back on the market, as a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Incase;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3a117c79-7d78-4cae-ba98-f2988eb3b2b2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Incase&amp;linkText=collaboration+with+Incase+has+promised&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmNhc2UuY29tL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25zL3NjdWxwdC1lcmdvbm9taWMta2V5Ym9hcmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJlOTRmMTYxLWQ1M2MtNGE1My05MWVmLWNhNjcwOTk1ZWZjNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5jYXNlLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9zY3VscHQtZXJnb25vbWljLWtleWJvYXJkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVuhzNElienf-HbjYEXLoVG4UKzhtuoLWzWcJKjFsCpt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.incase.com%2Fcollections%2Fsculpt-ergonomic-keyboard" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.incase.com/collections/sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard">collaboration with Incase has promised</a>, I'll try those models, too.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-other-ergonomic-keyboards-we-tested">Other ergonomic keyboards we tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-naya-create">Naya Create</h3> 
<p>I didn’t get to fully test the <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://naya.tech/">Naya Create</a> keyboard, but I was able to try one out for a few minutes during <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2025/">CES this year</a>. It’s one of the more customizable keyboards you’ll find. Not only is it a fully split, mechanical board with programmable keys, the thumb clusters sit just below two modular platforms that each accept a touchpad, trackball, dial or a 3D joystick. These are meant to replace your mouse and other input devices, eliminating travel for your cursor hand. Each half of the keyboard body bends in two places to allow for precise tenting and, from my short time with the Naya, the hinges and the entire board felt solidly built. The Naya Create starts at $500 before you add on any of the mouse modules, but that’s not stopping people from ordering. According to Naya’s website, the first three batches of pre-orders sold out and the fourth batch will ship in July 2025.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-kinesis-advantage-360"><strong>Kinesis Advantage 360</strong></h3> 
<p>If you want something fully split with thumb clusters and a columnar layout but that’s a little less minimal than the Zsa Voyager— and wireless to boot — the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/">Advantage 360</a> from Kinesis, makers of the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">popular Advantage 2</a> is a good one to check out. It looks like it comes from an ‘80s-era IBM office, but is somehow also from the future. The tenting goes from low to intense and the key well curves concavely to meet your fingers where they naturally land. The 360 is per-key <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/kb360/#smartset-app">programmable</a>, works with layers and has four macros keys.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-periboard-835"><strong>Periboard 835</strong></h3> 
<p>For a mechanical Alice keyboard with both wireless and wired capabilities, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0C5DYZ3C5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Periboard+835&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQzVEWVozQzU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmU5NGYxNjEtZDUzYy00YTUzLTkxZWYtY2E2NzA5OTVlZmM3Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQzVEWVozQzUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbR26SmNC0AnvLN02eAARFnqpOapQ-_Y5yaQ_4uY1Km6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C5DYZ3C5" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5DYZ3C5?th=1">Periboard 835</a> is a good pick. The Mac and Windows-compatible board has a solid build, low profile switches, RGB lighting, comfortable tenting and a few extra programmable keys.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-goldtouch-elite-adjustable">Goldtouch Elite Adjustable</h3> 
<p>I remember wondering if something like the <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shop.goldtouch.com/products/elite-adjustable-ergonomic-keyboard-pc-mac">Goldtouch Elite Adjustable</a> existed when I first started testing ergonomic keyboards. It didn’t at the time, as far as I could tell, but now a connected yet adjustable split board is indeed a product you can buy. It’s a solidly-built board and the ball joint connecting the two halves feels like it will put up with a lot of use. A squeeze of the lever at the top of the keys lets you set the board just how you like, adjusting both the vertical tenting and the angle between the two halves. There’s no programming to speak of, just the ability to swap a few function keys like print screen and home.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the tenting doesn’t work for me. Because of the extra keys at the outer edges, raising the middle edges upwards lifts the center keys considerably, which brings my wrists and forearms off the desk instead of letting them rest. Holding them like that created extra neck and shoulder strain on my part, which is sort of the opposite of the goal. But if you’re not into tenting anyway and want a flat, Alice-split board with an adjustable splay, this works quite well.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-kinesis-form-split-touchpad-keyboard">Kinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard</h3> 
<p>The idea behind the <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/form/">Kinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard</a> is pretty ergonomic: put the trackpad between the two halves and minimize travel for your mouse hand. The distance between the two puts your elbows at a comfortable distance and keeps your wrist nearly in-line with your forearms. The build is excellent, with low profile mechanical switches that feel smooth and just the right amount of clacky. The trackpad is responsive, but gestures only work with Windows computers. Even dragging and dropping doesn’t work on a Mac here, so I don’t see Apple users getting much use out of the board. I also found myself wishing for the slightest rotation of the keys — though they’re a good distance apart, a slight angle would keep my wrists fully unbent. There’s no tenting or negative tilt either, both of which could help a bit more, ergonomically speaking.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-logitech-wave-keys">Logitech Wave Keys</h3> 
<p>While it's a perfectly fine and affordable Bluetooth keyboard, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Logitech;elmt:;cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;linkText=Logitech+Wave&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpdGVjaC5jb20vZW4tdXMvcHJvZHVjdHMva2V5Ym9hcmRzL3dhdmUta2V5cy1lcmdvbm9taWMtd2lyZWxlc3MuOTIwLTAxMjI3NS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZTk0ZjE2MS1kNTNjLTRhNTMtOTFlZi1jYTY3MDk5NWVmYzciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvZ2l0ZWNoLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wcm9kdWN0cy9rZXlib2FyZHMvd2F2ZS1rZXlzLWVyZ29ub21pYy13aXJlbGVzcy45MjAtMDEyMjc1Lmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYRSm-cmGMxJHwoBHA3gqDmW0YNffbwyYp3Nd1BUQVpH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fkeyboards%2Fwave-keys-ergonomic-wireless.920-012275.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/wave-keys-ergonomic-wireless.920-012275.html">Logitech Wave</a> has minimal ergonomics. The keys rise up slightly in the middle and there's a comfortable wrist rest attached, but the layout is the same as any other keyboard, with no splitting of the keys to open up your arms or keep your wrists straight.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-ergonomic-keyboard-faqs">Ergonomic keyboard FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-kinds-of-ergonomic-keyboard-styles-are-there"><strong>What kinds of ergonomic keyboard styles are there?</strong></h3> 
<p>Most ergonomic keyboards fall into two categories: fully split which separates the board into two pieces, and unibody split, also known as an Alice design, which angles the keys outward at the bottom. When the keys are rotated outward or split into two halves, it allows for a wider spread between your elbows for a more relaxed typing position. Other ergonomic features, such as thumb clusters, center tenting and negative tilting are sometimes added to either type of board.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-keyboard-layout-is-the-most-ergonomic"><strong>Which keyboard layout is the most ergonomic?</strong></h3> 
<p>Since every person is different, there’s no one best ergonomic keyboard layout. The standard QWERTY layout is what most people are used to. The Dvorak, Colemak and Workman layouts rearrange the board to put the more commonly used letters closer to the home-key position. All three are intended to minimize your finger movements. That may indeed feel more comfortable and less fatiguing, but people used to the QWERTY layout will likely need to relearn how to type.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-i-need-a-split-keyboard"><strong>When do I need a split keyboard?</strong></h3> 
<p>You might feel some relief with a fully split keyboard if you find yourself tensing up at the shoulders as you type on a standard board. Putting some distance between your hands may allow your chest to stay more open, which for some is an easier position to maintain. You may also appreciate being able to place your mouse or trackpad between the two halves of the board to minimize the distance your cursor hand needs to travel.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-does-it-take-to-adjust-to-an-ergonomic-keyboard"><strong>How long does it take to adjust to an ergonomic keyboard?</strong></h3> 
<p>That depends on the type of keyboard. Since the Alice-split design simply rotates the keys apart, typing on it feels fairly similar to the regular keyboards you’re already used to. A fully split board will take a little more adjustment, particularly if it uses thumb clusters. The enter, shift and control buttons may now be operated by your thumbs instead of your other fingers and that can be tough to get used to. It took me a full month to get completely comfortable with a fully split keyboard with thumb clusters. But now, I prefer it to typing on regular boards.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ergonomic-keyboard-130047982.html?src=rss]]></description>

But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be.

If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html">foldables</a> — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.<br><br>At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years.

<h2 id="jump-link-other-smartphones-weve-tested">Other smartphones we've tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-iphone-air">iPhone Air</h3> 
<p>At just 5.6mm, the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air</a> is the thinnest iPhone ever made. But it’s so much more than that. It’s beautifully crafted and thanks to a titanium frame, Ceramic Shield 2 screen and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, it’s surprisingly durable too. The Air also has a gorgeous 6.5-inch display with ProMotion support and an A19 Pro processor, so it delivers nearly the same performance as you get from the iPhone 17 Pro line. And despite its super thin chassis not leaving a ton of room for a big power cell, battery life isn’t an issue. In short, this is the iPhone design that everyone wants. However, with the Air only having a single rear camera, the question you need to answer is if you’re willing to give up some extra lenses to get the most exquisitely engineered iPhone and all of its style and sleekness. <em>— S.R.</em></p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</h3> 
<p>While the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html">OnePlus 13</a> features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.</p> 
<p>OnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smartphone">What to look for in a smartphone</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-android-or-ios">Android or iOS?</h3> 
<p>When you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms.</p> 
<p>As for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-cameras">Cameras</h3> 
<p>Since your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html">Mid-range phones</a> often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-will-you-get-mmwave-5g-or-wi-fi-7">Will you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?</h3> 
<p>The good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.</p> 
<p>On the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/linksys-releases-its-first-ever-wi-fi-7-mesh-router-system-160053926.html">compatible router</a>, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-other-features-to-consider">Other features to consider</h3> 
<p>Because not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 17 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-smartphone-faqs">Smartphone FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-i-know-which-smartphone-is-the-best-for-me">How do I know which smartphone is the best for me?</h3> 
<p>While choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-is-a-smartphone">How much is a smartphone?</h3> 
<p>Smartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-can-you-do-on-a-smartphone">What can you do on a smartphone?</h3> 
<p>Smartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-smartphones-last">How long do smartphones last?</h3> 
<p>Smartphones can last years and people are <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252524995/Smartphone-trade-value-rises-as-average-age-of-devices-breaks-35-year-threshold">holding on to their phones</a> longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.</p>

Zuckerberg said Meta believes watching video content is going to be a huge category for both virtual reality headsets and glasses in the future. Meta has already teamed up with several major streaming services to provide shows and movies you can enjoy in VR. One of those partners is Disney+, which will give users access to the Marvel Cinematic Universe on their headsets, as well as to content from ESPN and Hulu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the interface Zuckerberg showed on the event, the unified hub will also give you easy access to Prime Video, Spotify, Peacock and Twitch, so you can watch shows, such as <em>The Boys</em> and <em>Fallout</em> on your virtual reality devices. In addition, Meta partnered with Universal Pictures and iconic horror company Blumhouse to give you exclusive access to horror flicks like <em>M3GAN</em> and <em>The Black Phone</em> on your Quest &quot;with immersive special effects you won’t find anywhere else.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Horizon TV hub supports Dolby Atmos for immersive sounds, with Dolby Vision arriving later this year for richer colors and crisper details. For a limited time, you&#39;ll be able to watch an exclusive 3D clip of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> on Horizon TV, as well, as part of Meta&#39;s partnership with James Cameron’s Lightstorm Vision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/meta-horizon-tv-is-an-entertainment-hub-for-vr-headsets-011216955.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rumors were true. Meta's first pair of AR glasses with a built-in screen is the Meta Ray-Ban Display. They'll cost $799 and will come to a limited number of brick-and-mortar stores in the United States on September 30. Those retailers include Best Buy, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban and Verizon, and availability will expand to Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom in early 2026.</p> 
<p>The Ray-Ban Displays have a camera, audio functionality, and a translucent heads-up display that shows and allows the wearer to respond to text chats, AI prompts, directions and video calls. You're able to use gestures to interact with the HUD, including small actions like swiping your fingers to type out a chat reply. Each pair requires and comes with a dedicated EMG wristband, the Meta Neural Band, which enables these interactions.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>At least, that's what Meta promises. The glasses failed to receive a phone call in a live demo during their announcement at the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-connect-2025-live-updates-gearing-up-for-hypernova-smart-glasses-with-displays-160058448.html">Connect 2025</a> conference, but they did perform other actions just fine. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg opened Spotify and played a song, took and viewed photos, and successfully demonstrated a real-time subtitle feature that looks legitimately useful. As outlined <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Meta;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=67db0fdf-8210-48f2-bb9f-0aecb268965d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Meta&amp;linkText=by+Meta&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9lbi1nYi9ibG9nL21ldGEtcmF5LWJhbi1kaXNwbGF5LWFpLWdsYXNzZXMtY29ubmVjdC0yMDI1LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjdkYjBmZGYtODIxMC00OGYyLWJiOWYtMGFlY2IyNjg5NjVkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9lbi1nYi9ibG9nL21ldGEtcmF5LWJhbi1kaXNwbGF5LWFpLWdsYXNzZXMtY29ubmVjdC0yMDI1LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcOq923137H1Nweg8kXh5pckeixZGv2BHV3NFkTQlf1S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fen-gb%2Fblog%2Fmeta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025/">by Meta</a>, the HUD supports Meta AI with visuals, messaging and video calling, previewing and zooming in on photos, turn-by-turn pedestrian navigation, live captions and translations, and music playback.</p> 
<p>Connect 2025 kicked off with Zuckerberg streaming his POV from a pair of Ray-Ban Displays, including a HUD on the right side showing Spotify, calendar reminders, text chats and incoming images with options to respond by dictating a message, dropping an emoji or selecting a typed phrase. The glasses and wristband come in two colors, black and sand, and two sizes, standard and large. All pairs have Transitions lenses that automatically adjust to light conditions.</p> 
<p>The glasses' display is "extremely high resolution," Zuckerberg was stoked to report. The HUD is full-color and supports 42 pixels per each degree of the field of view — compare that with the Meta Quest 3S, which has 20 pixels per degree. The glasses boast "six hours of mixed-use battery life and up to 30 hours of battery life total," while the Meta Neural Band has 18 hours of battery life and an IPX7 water rating.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Meta announced its first pair of Oakley-branded sunglasses, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-glasses-review-a-familiar-formula-with-some-upgrades-120026844.html">the HSTN frames</a>, earlier this year, it called them "performance AI" glasses even though they only came with modest upgrades compared with Meta's Ray-Ban lineup. But the new Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, which were <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Meta;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d1133324-3c44-41da-9dcf-594930fd4e7f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Meta&amp;linkText=just+unveiled&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL29ha2xleS1tZXRhLXZhbmd1YXJkLXByZS1vcmRlci1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1haS1nbGFzc2VzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDExMzMzMjQtM2M0NC00MWRhLTlkY2YtNTk0OTMwZmQ0ZTdmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL29ha2xleS1tZXRhLXZhbmd1YXJkLXByZS1vcmRlci1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1haS1nbGFzc2VzLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcxqE3VhfxXmJLPqtN_b5q8uyahAtfaOTIAm7XpV-NSL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Foakley-meta-vanguard-pre-order-performance-ai-glasses%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/blog/oakley-meta-vanguard-pre-order-performance-ai-glasses/">just unveiled</a> at Connect, are much more clearly aimed at serious athletes and they have the features to back it up.</p> 
<p>The $499 sunglasses feature Oakley's familiar wraparound frames and shiny (swappable) lenses. They are the first of Meta's smart glasses to change the placement of the camera, which is now in the center of the frames above the nose. According to Meta, this should make it harder for a hat or a helmet to ruin your shots, which was a consistent issue for me with the HSTN glasses.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Meta is making other camera adjustments that should make the glasses more reliable for capturing first-person action cam-style footage. The 12 megapixel camera now has a wider, 122-degree angle lens and adjustable video stabilization. There are also now dedicated modes for capturing slow motion videos as well as Instagram-ready hyperlapse slips.</p> 
<p>There are other spec upgrades too. Battery life has been improved to six hours of continuous music playback and nine hours of "mixed use". The charging case can provide another 36 hours of battery life. Meta also told me the glasses have been optimized for a wider range of temperatures, so the battery should hold up better in very cold or very hot environments.</p>

<p>The onboard speakers are more powerful. Mark Zuckerberg said during the Connect presentation that the open-ear speakers are 6 decibels louder than before. He said he took a call on a jet ski "a few weeks ago... it was great."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I cranked up the volume during my demo, I had to pause the music in order to hear the person next to me speaking. The glasses are also much more water resistant than their predecessors, with an IP67 rating that means they can be fully submerged.</p> 
<p>Meta has also changed up the button placement on the glasses, putting the capture button on the bottom right side of the glasses instead of the top. There's also a new "action button" that's particularly intriguing. This is a customizable button that users can program to trigger specific actions. For example, it could start playing a specific Spotify playlist or it could trigger a hyperlapse video. It can also be mapped to actions that take advantage of Meta AI, like providing a surf report or identifying what you're looking at. I'm not sure what I would use this button for, but I'm looking forward to trying it out when I get my hands on a pair for more than a few minutes.</p> 
<p>The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses will come with integrations for Strava and Garmin. In my demo, I walked on a treadmill while wearing a Garmin watch and the Vanguard glasses. This meant I could ask Meta AI for info about my heart rate and my pace. If you're a Strava user, you can overlay photos and videos from your run onto the stats you get at the end of your run.</p> 
<p>Like the HSTN glasses, I have a feeling the Vanguard frames could be a bit… polarizing. Most people do not want to wear big wraparound sunglasses for daily activities. I definitely don't! But Meta has added enough new features that the $499 sunglasses might actually make sense for athletes. I've been wearing Oakley ski goggles for years and I suspect a pair of Vanguard glasses could easily replace them in most conditions.</p> 
<p>The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are available now for pre-order. They officially go on sale October 21.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">As expected, Meta has introduced new smart glasses during its Connect conference today. The announcements included a “Gen 2” of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which retail starting at $379.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">There are a bunch of upgrades over the $299 </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Ray-Ban Meta</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> set that the duo released in 2023. Meta highlighted improvements to battery life, which it says now lasts up to eight hours with "typical use." The included charging case now provides an additional 48 hours of juice, versus 32 hours for the current one. The glasses can also charge to 50 percent battery in 20 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The second-gen glasses are equipped with a 12-megapixel camera and offer 3K Ultra HD video capture, with “up to 60 frames per second” and HDR support. Meta says it will release updates that add hyperlapse and slow-motion video capture to all of its AI glasses later in the fall. The second-gen Ray-Ban Meta has 32GB of storage and is IPX-4 rated for water resistance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">On stage at Meta Connect, Mark Zuckerberg spoke about “conversation focus,” a new feature that will help you hear voices better in live environments. This feature will also be coming to the first-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses. There was also a demo of “live AI” that… did not go well. It was supposed to show Meta’s AI looking at ingredients on a table and helping to prepare a dish, but it appeared to skip forward a few steps and the demo ended unsuccesfully with a “bad Wi-Fi” excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">On the style side, the Gen 2 Ray-Bans be available with the same three base frames as the originals: Wayfarer, Skyler and Headliner. All three will be available with a range of lenses, including regular, polarized, transitions and prescription. Polarized lenses will cost an additional $30, while transitions add $80 to the bill. There’s no set price for prescription lenses due to the innumerable ways our eyes can suck.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The second-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses are available to purchase now in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, UAE, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Mexico, India and Brazil will have access to the new glasses "soon."&nbsp;At least for now, it seems as though Ray-Ban and Meta will continue to sell its Gen 1 wearable at the same $299 price alongside the new model.</span></p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dalia is a death cleaner.</p>
<p>Death cleaning, as we know it, is the process of sanitizing and tidying the spaces where people take their final breaths, sometimes long after their bodies have begun to decompose. It’s a job here on Earth in the year 2025, but Dalia’s version of death cleaning takes place on the rings of Saturn in a distant future filled with space travel, interplanetary colonization and devastating disease outbreaks. In this scenario, death cleaning involves spraying chemicals over bulging piles of otherworldly contamination and avoiding their defense mechanisms, which can cause fires, explosions and electrical interference. Dalia learns from the alien material as she cleans, harvesting fruit from fungal mounds to create new options for her sprayer. She also listens to the last words of the dead.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Ambrosia Sky </em>is the first game from independent studio <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://softrains.games/">Soft Rains</a> and its story trailer landed on Wednesday. In <em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, Dalia is cleaning the Cluster, an agricultural outpost on Saturn’s rings that collapsed when a mysterious biological force subsumed the colony and its people. It&#39;s also Dalia’s former home.</p>
<div id="717e100d2067448aa87c7671b2e3e7f4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBts7GmEIBs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>As a Scarab with The Ambrosia Project, her job is to clear out the alien fungus, research its origins and perform Death Rites on the corpses she encounters. Scarabs operate in the shadowy spaces between science and mysticism, and The Ambrosia Project’s goal is to discover a cure for mortality among the stars. Death Rites involve hearing the deceased person’s Last Will and cremating their body with specialized spores, adding their DNA to The Ambrosia Project for further research. It’s a ritualistic acknowledgement of a person’s life as much as their death, and these small ceremonies are just as critical in <em>Ambrosia Sky</em> as the game’s first-person cleaning mechanics.</p>
<p>“I really let myself and our team explore more mythological or fantastical elements, or even folkloric elements, because I think there&#39;s only so much we can know about outer space,” Soft Rains narrative director Kaitlin Tremblay told Engadget. “[Also] there are things that we know concretely about death, but there&#39;s so much about it we don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s the same kind of interesting liminal space. What don’t we know, and how do we tell stories and try to comfort ourselves and contend with that? That actually makes my brand of sci-fi and my approach on death really similar.”</p>
<p><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> is an investigation of the universe and mortality alike, in the form of a first-person, speculative-fiction cleaning sim on Saturn’s rings. It features zero-gravity scenes, crafting, equipment upgrades and classic FPS play, underpinned by a slowly unfurling story of lethal disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soft Rains has been quietly working on <em>Ambrosia Sky</em> since late 2022 and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVBW2vcdPJ7zfiFE2MVSMfRTKzyoz0lA/view">formally announced the game</a> in March 2025. The studio was founded by Tremblay — who was narrative designer on <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> and <em>Grindstone</em>, and lead writer of <em>A Mortician’s Tale </em>and <em>Seasonala Cemetery </em>— and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/there-is-an-expectation-were-gonna-make-a-little-skyrim-ubisoft-and-bethesda-veterans-form-new-studio-led-by-skyrim-and-fallout-designer-debuting-with-first-person-sci-fi-and-crunchy-mechanics/">other industry veterans</a> from Bethesda, Ubisoft and indie teams.</p>

<p><em>Ambrosia Sky&#39;</em>s story trailer features a staticky, disembodied voice saying, “Hey, Dalia. It’s me. When I die, I want a Scarab called in. And I want it to be you.” It’s surprisingly heart-wrenching, for a two-minute teaser of a sci-fi clean-em-up.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s just honest, right?” Tremblay said. “We have a lot of emotions about death, and our own death and everything around it. Some of those emotions contain brightness and some of them contain darkness, and both are equally valid. Both can exist at the same time.”</p>
<p>Death is a regular visitor in Tremblay’s writing. In particular, <em>A Mortician’s Tale</em> is an acclaimed presentation of the business of mortality, and <em>Seasonala Cemetery</em> is a meditative experience about spending time in a graveyard. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.softrains.games/scarabs-immortality-and-saying-goodbye-to-the-dead-e8a359d6a9f3">devlog entry</a> on June 10, Tremblay compared the mortality angle in <em>Ambrosia Sky</em> to that of <em>A Mortician’s Tale</em>, writing, “With <em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, we wanted to have the opportunity to explore how we feel about our own death, rather than the death of our loved ones.”</p>
<p>I was struck by this distinction when I first read it, and because I&#39;m also consumed by thoughts of my own inescapable expiration, I asked Tremblay for more. They said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>“That is particularly the approach I&#39;m taking for the Death Rituals. The Death Rituals are when you find those individuals in the world and you sample their DNA for the project, but you&#39;re also listening to their recorded Last Wills. I really wanted those to be a moment to let the characters talk authentically about what their death actually means to them. Because I feel like in my work and in so many other games, it&#39;s often about how <strong><em>we</em></strong> feel about death, or <strong><em>our</em></strong> grief or <strong><em>our</em></strong> mourning process. <br><br>“I think this is probably a symptom of post-pandemic brain and getting older, but I’m thinking a lot more about what does <em>my</em> death actually mean to me, and trying to sit with it in a way that doesn&#39;t keep me up until 4AM. So I think this is really that kind of approach. We all probably think about our own death and people have a lot of feelings on their own potential death, and so I wanted to give voice to that, and have this space to talk through and work through some of those emotions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And clean up giant tendrils of neon fungus, of course.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-if-i-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-iphone"><strong>What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-should-i-upgrade-to-ios-187-or-ios-26">Should I upgrade to iOS 18.7 or iOS 26?</h2>
<p>When you first open Software Update in Settings, you'll notice two different upgrade options: iOS 18.7 and iOS 26. Apple released the former to address security issues, so you can at least download that one if you're unsure about all the big changes on iOS 26. It also gives you more time to wait for Apple to take care of any bugs on the new OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you're excited to finally have the Liquid Glass aesthetic on your phone and use all the new features iOS 26 has to offer, go ahead and install that one. After all, Apple had all summer to weed through the most problematic bugs during its beta phase and usually releases a new update shortly after the initial launch.</p>

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>

That means less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens is too dirty.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Representative Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) are leading a group of congressional Democrats <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-stansbury-members-of-congress-launch-investigation-into-trump-crypto-and-ai-czars-ethics-conflicts">in investigating</a> White House Special Advisor David Sacks for possibly serving in his position for longer than he&#39;s allowed. Sacks, a former PayPal executive and venture capitalist at Craft Ventures, was originally picked by President Donald Trump to be the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/crypto-evangelist-david-sacks-will-serve-as-trumps-ai-and-cryptocurrency-advisor-170522273.html">&quot;White House A.I. &amp; Crypto Czar&quot;</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>&quot;Any effort to stay beyond the time limits imposed on you as a Special Government Employee (SGE) would raise additional ethics concerns for you and the Trump Administration,&quot; the group writes in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/david_sacks_sge_letter_91625.pdf">a letter to Sacks</a>,&quot;particularly as it moves to implement recently enacted cryptocurrency legislation and put in place new rules for the crypto industry.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides being friendly with the Trump campaign and allies like Elon Musk, Sacks was given his position because of his knowledge of the crypto and AI industries as an investor. That poses an obvious conflict of interest, something that&#39;s only waived during the 130-day limit that SGEs are supposed to serve. As Warren and the other Democrats backing the investigation note, though, it&#39;s possible Sacks has been working in his role for longer than that.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have worked every calendar day since the presidential inauguration, your 130th day of work in this role was May 29, 2025,&quot; the group writes. &quot;If you have worked every business day, your 130th day was July 25, 2025. As of the date of this letter, it is the 167th business day of this Administration.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of the investigation, Sacks is expected to offer a more detailed account of when and how he works in his advisory role, including if he answers government emails while working in Silicon Valley. Congressional Democrats are trying to verify if norms have been violated to make sure that they won&#39;t be violated in the future, but there are larger ethical concerns to contend with, too.</p>
<p>The second Trump administration has been friendly to the crypto industry, likely thanks in part to the influence of Sacks. Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trumps-federal-bitcoin-reserve-order-leaves-the-crypto-market-unenthused-184135436.html">federal Bitcoin stockpile</a> and signed the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22genius+act%22%7D">GENIUS Act</a> into law in July, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically tied to the value of the US dollar. Continuing to serve in his role without leaving his position at Craft Ventures or disclosing his investments would only raise more questions about how Sacks stands to benefit from advising on regulation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/democrats-are-investigating-trump-crypto-advisor-david-sacks-over-a-possible-sge-violation-215758087.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Instead of releasing iOS 19, Apple skipped its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems were released in 2025, they're all designated "26" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues — great news if you don't have a phone that's eligible to run the latest OS. If you're wondering which one to download first, it's really up to you. Do you want to wait for Apple to quash any bugs in iOS 26 or do you want access to all the new features everyone's talking about now?</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>
<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a "<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">new translucent material</a>" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>That said, while it was in beta mode, Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html">incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic looks with <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-turn-ios-26-liquid-glass-settings-off">How to turn iOS 26 Liquid Glass settings off</h2>
<p>If you find you don't like the new clear look after downloading iOS 26, you can change a couple Accessibility settings, though you can't completely turn off Liquid Glass. For starters, you can reduce the liquid look by going to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Motion &gt; toggle on Reduce Motion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make your drop-down menus more opaque instead of translucent by going to Settings &gt;Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; toggle on Reduce Transparency.</p>
<p>You can also change your clear apps back to the way they were. Just press and hold any app on your screen and select Edit Home Screen. From here, tap Edit (top left) and Customize. You can swap out to Default, Dark or Tinted.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>
<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>
<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can now scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call, FaceTime or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation uses Apple Intelligence and it will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends can now create polls in group messages to decide things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>
<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's been frustrated with last year's <a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html">changes to the Photos app</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are back. Library and Collections have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-use-the-new-iphone-camera-app-in-ios-26-141038196.html"><strong>Camera app updates</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Navigating the Camera app should be simpler in iOS 26, as all the buttons and menus are in convenient spots — less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens needs to be cleaned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html">FaceTime "Communication Safety" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen is more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-change-your-iphones-snooze-length-in-ios-26-112017653.html"><strong>New alarm setting</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You'll no longer be stuck with the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms. Instead, you now have the option to change your snooze time from one to 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html"><strong>Screenshots look different</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You'll notice several new features when you take a screenshot, including "highlight to search," the option to search your image on Google and ChatGPT is there for any questions you have about the image.</p>
<p><strong>Preview on iOS 26:</strong> There's a <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-started-with-preview-on-iphone-iph7239ea3b5/26/ios/26">new app called Preview</a> that lets you scan documents, fill out PDF forms, as well as highlight, underline or strike through text in a PDF file. You can also remove backgrounds from images in this app.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-changes-coming-to-ipados-26">New changes with iPadOS 26</h2>
<p>Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 also has the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look appears on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>
<p>There's more beyond that, so be sure to check out our <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-about-airpods">What about AirPods?</h2>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this "studio-quality" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>
<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> <a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-offer-live-translation-and-improved-noise-cancellation-171018061.html">Live translation is available on AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with ANC when paired with iPhones running iOS 26. Apple says that when someone speaks to you in a different language, you can use your AirPods to translate what they’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring:</strong> Apple introduced new AirPods Pro 3 earbuds this month, which include heart rate monitoring. It will work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-will-siri-get-an-update">Did Siri get an update?</h2>
<p>Siri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point "<a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html">in the coming year</a>," so you shouldn't expect any major changes right now. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html">"stripped-down" AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>

Although the listing has since been removed, screencaps shared on social media documented the accidental reveal.</span></p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">夕方頃、龍が如く公式サイトのカテゴリー一覧に「龍が如く 極3」が載っていたみたいですね<a href="https://t.co/3a8NsbTFlu">https://t.co/3a8NsbTFlu</a> <a href="https://t.co/lhzATp6yQZ">pic.twitter.com/lhzATp6yQZ</a></p>— れんか (@Renka_schedule) <a href="https://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1968302714133311738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The timing of the leak also aligns nicely with the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, where RGG is scheduled to host a dedicated event. That certainly looks like the prime moment to officially announce <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> as its latest remake project. It is still technically possible to play the original <em>Yakuza 3</em>, which was released on PlayStation 3 in 2009. The game got remasters for the PlayStation 4 and later for the Xbox One and PC, but a full overhaul to the third entry in the franchise will be welcome news for its many loyal fans.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The action-adventure <em>Yakuza</em> game series is known for its excellent combat mechanics, memorable characters, and storytelling that manages to weave deftly between ludicrous and profound.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">has asked</a> the CEOs of Discord, Twitch, Valve and Reddit to testify at a hearing on online radicalization. The hearing will be held on October 8, 2025, and is in direct response to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-things-to-know-dcde3f792f4d6636d44fb9f4fa53569c">the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk</a>, an event some have tried to connect to the online communities the alleged shooter, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-tyler-robinson-court-death-penalty-f541df08a936e06497ee2342296bc398">Tyler Robinson</a>, participated in.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,&quot; Comer shared in the press release announcing the hearing. &quot;To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following Kirk&#39;s death, law enforcement, regulators and the press have exerted significant effort to both understand Robinson&#39;s actions and structure them into a coherent narrative. The fact that he seemingly engraved the bullets he used with <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-bullet-memes/">references to furry memes and the game <em>Helldivers</em></a> implies he may have been immersed in online culture, and could have been influenced by who he interacted with there.

<p>In general, online platforms don&#39;t escape scrutiny after tragic events, so these sorts of hearings are to be expected. Twitch and Discord were both investigated by the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-discord-twitch-investigation-discord-twitch-193208337.html">New York</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-jersey-attorney-general-investigation-discord-twitch-buffalo-shooting-004541963.html">New Jersey Attorney Generals</a> following a 2022 shooting in Buffalo, New York, for example. Given the reaction to Kirk&#39;s death, though, it remains to be seen how much the House Oversight Committee actually wants answers from online platforms, and how much it wants to lay the blame at their feet.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/house-committee-asks-discord-valve-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-online-radicalization-184100470.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/stopncii-program-partnership/">partnering</a> with a UK nonprofit to fight non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). (You may know it better as <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/us-congress-passes-take-it-down-revenge-porn-bill-that-also-covers-ai-deepfakes-120047880.html">revenge porn</a>.) Over the coming months, the company will begin using StopNCII&#39;s hashes. These user-uploaded digital fingerprints can block individuals&#39; unwanted intimate content from appearing in search results.</p>
<p>StopNCII has a pretty neat <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://stopncii.org/how-it-works/">system</a> to combat revenge porn. Say you have some images you most definitely don&#39;t want surfacing online. Select the picture on your device, and StopNCII will create a digital fingerprint of the file. That hash will be uploaded to the service. <em>The photo itself never leaves your device.</em> The organization then shares the hash (again, not the spicy pic) with participating platforms.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Then, if an asshole ex takes the liberty of uploading said photo to one of those companies&#39; services, it should be removed automatically. If the platform uses <em>real-time</em> hash matching, it can even block the upload immediately before it reaches anyone&#39;s eyes. It&#39;s a pretty solid defense against an ugly problem.</p>
<p>The system isn&#39;t bulletproof. First, it only works for known images. So, if someone else has an intimate photo that you don&#39;t have a copy of, you&#39;ll have to fight that using other means. StopNCII doesn&#39;t work for AI-generated images, audio recordings or saucy text chats.</p>
<p>The system also won&#39;t help if the content is uploaded to a non-partner platform. In addition to Google, StopNCII <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://stopncii.org/partners/industry-partners/?lang=en-gb">partners</a> with Meta, Reddit, Pornhub, OnlyFans, Snap, Microsoft Bing, X and more.</p>
<p>This is far from Google&#39;s first move to combat NCII. A decade ago, it created a system for <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-19-google-filtering-revenge-porn-by-request.html">submitting revenge porn takedown requests</a>. In 2024, it <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-explicit-deepfakes-from-its-search-results-130058499.html">made it easier to remove deepfake NCII</a>. On Wednesday, Google product manager Griffin Hunt explained that &quot;given the scale of the open web, there&#39;s more to be done to reduce the burden on those who are affected by it.&quot;</p>
<p>If you&#39;re 18 or older and have any photos of yourself that you want to flag proactively, you can start using StopNCII right now. Head to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://stopncii.org/create-your-case/">the org&#39;s website to create a case</a>. Note that the service only works for pictures that are nude, semi-nude or show a sexual act. And remember, <em>the photo itself never leaves your device</em>, so your privacy remains intact.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-will-upgrade-its-revenge-porn-defenses-with-help-from-a-uk-nonprofit-181016291.html?src=rss]]></description>

Meanwhile, Microsoft and PC makers jumped at the opportunity to build touchscreen laptops years ago. The </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-30-windows-8-review.html">tablet-focused Windows 8</a> <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">was a failure, sure, but touchscreens led to excellent convertible notebooks and hybrid tablets like the Surface lineup. Now, according to a new rumor from longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple might finally be ready to bring touchscreens to the MacBook Pro.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">a tweet posted this morning</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, Kuo wrote, &quot;</span><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">MacBook models will feature a touch panel for the first time, further blurring the line with the iPad.

This shift appears to reflect Apple’s long-term observation of iPad user behavior, indicating that in certain scenarios, touch controls can enhance both productivity and the…</p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></blockquote> </div><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Specifically, Kuo says that touchscreen MacBook Pro models are &quot;expected to enter mass production by late 2026,&quot; and that they&#39;ll use on-cell touch technology. Cheaper MacBooks (likely the Air) coming in late 2025 likely won&#39;t have touchscreens, but that could change with a 2027 refresh.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It’s worth pointing out that Kuo’s predictions, which typically come from sources within Apple’s supply chain, aren’t always accurate. But given the timing of this particular note, and the ubiquity of touchscreen laptops these days, it’s the idea of a touchscreen MacBook isn’t too farfetched.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Apple is a stubborn company, no doubt — especially when it comes to adopting features from others. When referring to iPad competitors in 2010, Steve Jobs famously said, &quot;If you see a stylus, they blew it.&quot; While he was referring to using a stylus for general operation of a device, and not a highly specific use-case, it was still funny to see </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-10-apple-ipad-pro-pencil-designer-reaction.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">the Apple Pencil</span></a><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> arrive five years later on the iPad Pro. There&#39;s a certain nobility to sticking with your design convictions, but it would have been stupid for Apple to completely ignore the benefits of tablet stylii, something Microsoft was leaning into hard with its Surface devices.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">So it goes with the touchscreen MacBook Pros. It&#39;s hard to deny the convenience of lazily swiping the screen when scrolling through long articles, instead of tapping repeatedly on your keyboard or swiping a touchpad. Apple&#39;s desire to keep touchscreens away from Macs is understandable. MacOS doesn&#39;t have large touch-points like iPadOS, and it&#39;s been honed for decades to work best with keyboards, mice and touchpads. But adding in basic touchscreen support doesn&#39;t really require a complete macOS redesign, especially when the platform has already had support for multitouch gestures on trackpads since the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-01-15-first-macbook-air-multi-touch-control-panel-screenshot.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">first MacBook Air arrived in 2008</span></a><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It&#39;s funny that the touchscreen MacBook Pro could also be arriving just as Apple is finally starting to make the iPad more Mac-like. </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">iPadOS 26</span></a><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> adds the ability to resize app windows, easily organize them on your screen and it even brings over the menu bar from MacOS. It&#39;s as if Apple is trying to appease all of its fans: The iPad owners who want more multitasking and productivity options, as well as the Mac owners who want a bit of iPad-like convenience.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Both of my kids were able to nimbly swipe around my phones and tablets at the age of two — that&#39;s the power of a truly intuitive input mechanism. And to a certain degree, I also think it helped them get used to the idea of computing in general. If it&#39;s easy enough for kids to grasp, why not make touchscreens a core feature of as many products as possible?&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(15, 20, 25);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Simply put, Apple has run out of excuses. The time for touchscreen Macbooks is now.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><br><br></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/a-macbook-pro-touchscreen-about-damn-time-180000315.html?src=rss]]></description>

It&#39;ll soon include more than just articles from throughout the web. The company says the platform will be incorporating stuff like social media posts from platforms like Instagram and X along with YouTube Shorts.</p>
<p>“In our research, people told us they enjoyed seeing a mix of content in Discover, including videos and social posts, in addition to articles,” the company wrote in an announcement. These changes will start showing up in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot;</p>

That’s a sizable saving of $60.</p> 
<p>A smaller version of the air fryer we featured as the best dual-zone option in our 2025 air fryer <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html"><ins>buyers guide</ins></a>, the two-basket DZ090C lets you cook up two totally different foods in separate baskets simultaneously. And while its six-quart capacity isn’t hugely spacious, you should have more than enough space for small or solo meals. And if you have a small kitchen, it’s probably a more sensible pick than the DZ401 we highlight in our guide.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple released an entirely new lineup of Apple Watches during its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event/">“Awe dropping” launch event</a> in mid September. There’s now a new flagship, Apple Watch Series 11, a revamped entry-level model, Apple Watch SE 3, and the next generation of the premium wearable, Apple Watch Ultra 3. We didn’t get a new version of either the SE or the Ultra last year, and Apple made up for the wait by giving those two significant updates. The Series 11 is still what we recommend for most people, but the other two are more compelling than ever. Here, we break down the differences between the models so you can pick the best Apple Watch for your wrist computer needs.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-apple-watch">What to look for in an Apple Watch</h2> 
<p>Like all Apple products, Apple Watches will only work with other devices from the brand's ecosystem. You won't be able to pair any Apple Watch to your Android phone. Note that you <em>can</em> pair other wearables (like a Garmin tracker or a Fitbit band) with your iPhone. There are some more features that are specific to Apple Watches and that set each of the three models apart from one another.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-chips-and-sensors"><strong>Chips and sensors</strong></h3> 
<p>All three models in the current lineup have the same S10 SiP (system in a package) chip with a four-core Neural Engine. The chip allows for on-device processing of Siri requests as well as dictation, translation, automatic workout detection and the double tap and wrist flick gestures that let you control your watch hands-free.</p> 
<p>You get an optical heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope and light sensor in every Apple Watch model, but the Series 11 and Ultra 3 have a more advanced heart monitor that in part enables the new hypertension detection feature. The two higher-end watches also have sensors that can generate an ECG and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html">detect blood oxygen</a>, water temperature and water depth.</p> 
<p>Fall and crash detection come standard no matter which Apple wearable you pick and all support near field communication (NFC) for Apple Pay. If you opt for the cellular versions of the Series 11 or SE 3, your watch will have access to 5G networks. Cell connectivity comes standard on the Ultra 3 and the watch now also has satellite-enabled SOS, messaging and Find My abilities.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-displays-and-case-options"><strong>Displays and case options</strong></h3> 
<p>Every Apple Watch model now has an always-on display. The wide-angle OLED display on the Apple Watch 11 and Ultra 3 lets you see the always-on display from more angles. The SE can reach a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, the Series 11 can get as bright as 2,000 and the Ultra 3 hits 3,000 nits. Both higher-end screens can dim to a single nit, making them less distracting in the dark. And the Ultra model has the added night mode feature on certain watch faces that turns the dial red to preserve your night vision.</p> 
<p>As for case sizes, the SE 3 is available in 40 or 44mm. The Series 11 has a choice of a 42 or 46mm case. The Ultra 3 comes in just one size measuring 49mm. The SE 3 has an aluminum case in two colors (Starlight or Midnight). The Series 11 lets you pick from aluminum (in Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray or Jet Black) or titanium (in Natural, Gold or Slate). And the Ultra 3 only comes in titanium (either Natural or Black).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life"><strong>Battery life</strong></h3> 
<p>The Apple Watch Ultra 3 sports the biggest battery and can last for a claimed 42 hours on a charge. The Apple Watch 11 is rated to go for 24 hours and the SE 3 gets an estimated 18 hours before it needs a visit to the charger. Low power mode will get you many more hours, going for as long as 72 hours for the Ultra 3, 38 hours on the Series 11 and 32 hours on the SE 3. All three are now capable of fast charging and Apple states an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes for the SE 3 and Ultra 3 and 80 percent in 30 minutes for the Series 11.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-fitness-and-wellness-features"><strong>Fitness and wellness features</strong></h3> 
<p>All three Apple Watches have similar fitness tracking chops. The Activity app uses three “rings” to keep tabs on how much you’re moving in a day: The Move ring tracks your active calories; the Exercise ring monitors the minutes you’ve spent walking, running, doing yoga and so on; and the Stand ring tells you how many hours in a day you’ve stood up and moved around for at least one minute.</p> 
<p>Different internal sensors detect those activities, for example the accelerometer senses when you’re moving versus sitting still, and the optical heart rate sensor judges how hard you're working out and how many calories you’ve burned. You can set your goals for each ring and you’ll earn badges and animations when you hit them.</p> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">Workout Buddy</a> will work with all three watches, but you’ll need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone nearby as well as Bluetooth headphones to use it. All three can access <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-offline-maps-apd0111bf788/watchos">offline maps</a>, which could prove useful when hiking far from cellular coverage. But if going off-grid is something you plan to do often, you may appreciate the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-3-a-closer-look-at-its-satellite-communications-tools-120012387.html">satellite connectivity</a> of the Apple Watch Ultra 3.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-siri"><strong>Siri</strong></h3> 
<p>You can get the weather, start a workout, identify a song and dictate a text just by asking Siri. All Apple Watch models support the Raise to Speak feature that bypasses the need to say “Hey Siri” and will instead listen for your request when you lift your wrist near your mouth.</p> 
<p>Every Apple Watch model utilizes onboard processing of Siri requests now, too. That means executing simple requests like starting workouts and timers are quicker, as they won’t need to access external networks. However, requests like sending texts or getting weather forecasts still need to communicate with Wi-Fi or cellular, so you’ll need to have your phone nearby if you have a GPS-only model.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-carbon-neutral-claims"><strong>Carbon neutral claims</strong></h3> 
<p>Apple declared the Series 9 with the aluminum case its first carbon neutral product. But has since<a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-isnt-making-any-carbon-neutral-claims-with-its-series-11-smartwatch-190216278.html"> dropped those claims</a>, possibly due to legal challenges in a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/german-court-rules-apple-cannot-call-its-smartwatch-carbon-neutral-181536366.html">German court</a>. Instead, Apple states that all three watches have been designed to “reduce environmental impact” and the company still maintains its commitment to becoming <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8775e6de-d7c2-4b43-a8c2-7ec2f62a6d73&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=carbon+neutral+by+2030&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4Nzc1ZTZkZS1kN2MyLTRiNDMtYThjMi03ZWMyZjYyYTZkNzMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASo97OHOqAN7cM9s53IhRN_eU6_Bi3vWNEDv8lyhP4WA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fenvironment%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/environment/">carbon neutral by 2030</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price"><strong>Price</strong></h3> 
<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the three new wearables was the lack of price increase from previous models. The Apple Watch SE still starts at $249, the Series 11 goes for $399 and up, and the Ultra 3 begins at $799. That puts a $550 difference between entry prices for the cheapest and most expensive Apple Watches.</p> 
<p>For $250 you can get the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 with GPS-only connectivity; adding cellular connectivity ups the price by $50. The Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399 for the 42mm, non-cellular model in aluminum and goes as high as $749 for the 46mm titanium case (which comes with cellular). The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is $799 for a titanium 49mm case with both GPS and cellular, but the price goes up with different bands.

During that time, we run, hit the gym, go on hikes and wear it while sleeping, all the while gauging how it tracks various metrics, integrates with the iPhone and performs every other trick Apple claims its smartwatches can do.</p> 
<p>Since we also review smartwatches from other companies, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watch-6-review-evolution-not-revolution-120006375.html">Samsung</a>'s Galaxy Watches and <a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-watch-2-review-not-leading-the-way-but-no-longer-lagging-170007702.html">Google</a> Pixels, our editors can compare Apple Watches not just to previous generations, but also to other wearables on the market. Our buying guides and recommendations rely on first-hand testing by Engadget staff.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-the-best-apple-watch-apps-for-fitness-tracking"><strong>What are the best Apple Watch apps for fitness tracking?</strong></h3> 
<p>All three watches use the same Fitness and Workout apps to track your progress, and they all have sensors to track speed, cadence, distance and heart rate. But the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11 have more sensors than the Apple Watch SE 3.</p> 
<p>Additional tech includes an electrical heart rate sensor and a depth gauge. The two pricier watches also have a blood oxygen app and an ECG app, all of which may give you a better picture of your overall health. All three models are compatible with the AI-powered Workout Buddy from <a data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html">watchOS 26</a> (the feature also requires an <a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-what-devices-and-features-will-actually-be-supported-185850732.html">AI-compatible iPhone</a>).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-any-of-the-apple-watch-series-waterproof"><strong>Are any of the Apple Watch series waterproof?</strong></h3> 
<p>All three models are water <em>resistant</em>. But they can all handle immersion in water, including a swim. The Apple Watch SE 3 and Series 11 can handle a depth of up to 50 meters while the Ultra 3 can be submerged up to 100 meters.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html?src=rss]]></description>

It costs $300, which is twice the cost of the previous generation and $50 more than an Apple Watch SE.</p> 
<p>The Bounce 2 still offers tracking and communication features, both powered by an LTE connection. The exterior has been completely redesigned, with a rounded 1.2-inch AMOLED display. The original model was square-ish, resembling an Apple Watch.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Communication is better here, which is good as this is a smartwatch intended for parents to keep track of kids. Voice messages sent to the watch will be transcribed and can be read or listened to. It also allows for actual phone calls, which the original did not. The Bounce 2 offers GPS tracking and the battery lasts two full days between charges.</p> 
<p>It can play music, but only with an Amazon Music subscription. Also, all communication features require a subscription to one of Garmin's in-house smartwatch plans. These cost $10 per month or $100 annually. The Bounce 2 is available to order right now and comes in three colors.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you enter the building that houses Apple’s audio lab, venture just beyond reception and you’ll encounter a massive vintage stereo setup. The deck and accompanying speakers were a gift from Steve Jobs to the team of engineers who work in this office. The group sees the old-school tech as a source of inspiration, but also as a reminder of Jobs’ obsession with both music and sound.</p>
<p>More than inspiration, though, the stereo is a reminder to the experts in software, acoustics and sound design how important sound is to everything Apple builds.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, I was led into a maze of nondescript halls, weaving from room to room with a trio of Apple engineers as my guides. I was in for a rare peek into the company’s product development facilities — a step further behind the curtain than what’s typically allowed <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-apple-revealed-at-the-iphone-17-launch-event-iphone-air-iphone-17-pro-airpods-pro-3-and-more-171028663.html">during Apple events</a>.</p>

<p>As Apple’s audio team works to correct and calibrate the AirPods&#39; fit for natural variations in ear geometry, they use a collection of audio metric booths to check their work. These rooms look like small, windowless offices. The walls are covered in sound-dampening panels and there’s a single workstation with a Mac and various tools for hearing analysis. If you’ll recall, one of the company’s major ambitions with AirPods has been the end-to-end hearing health experience that it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-airpods-pro-hearing-health-tools-could-normalize-wearing-earbuds-everywhere-140054858.html">debuted last year</a>. In order to validate its claims of a “clinical grade hearing test,” engineers use devices you might see in an audiologist&#39;s office, like audiometers. These spaces aren’t unlike the small booths you’ve probably sat in for a professionally-administered hearing test.</p>
<p>In one booth alone, the team ran thousands of tests on the feature to ensure that the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-use-apples-airpods-pro-2-as-a-hearing-aid-173049967.html">hearing screening in your pocket</a> was as accurate as what you could get from a doctor. Not only does this allow AirPods users to set up a hearing aid at home (if needed), but it also creates an accurate hearing profile so that you can hear music the way it was intended.</p>
<p>Another important step in the product design process was making sure there was a tuning baseline for every person that listens to music with AirPods. Everyone hears various frequencies differently, so there needs to be an adjustment to achieve the desired consistency. With the hearing test and accompanying audio profile, Apple then has a starting point to make both technical and artistic decisions. It’s here that the technology and liberal arts expertise among the audio lab team starts to mix.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-when-your-office-is-a-tuning-studio">When your office is a tuning studio</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/9befbb30-9358-11f0-b5ff-33bc5f24c980" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/9befbb30-9358-11f0-b5ff-33bc5f24c980" style="height:1920px;width:2560px;" alt="Apple&#39;s tuning studios are equal parts recording studio, music creation space and listening room." data-uuid="1e0f6d1f-bec4-3a53-8217-852c5c01907a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The media tuning lab works on any product Apple makes that can reproduce recorded audio, including the iPhone, Mac and iPad. In order to bridge the gap between the art and science of that pursuit, this team comes from a variety of backgrounds — from live concert sound, to Broadway sound design and even traditional acoustic engineering. The various tuning studios in this area  are set up like music creation rooms: complete mini studios with various instruments scattered around, a prime seat for listening in the back and a desk replacing the recording engineer’s sound board. As a nice touch, they&#39;re all named after famous recording studios (like Abbey Road).</p>
<p>The main idea there is that the tuning team needs to reference what the recorded content sounded like at the time it was created. That, in turn, provides a better picture of the artist’s intention that can then be applied to products like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html">the AirPods Pro 3</a>. Due to the combination of the ear tips’ seal and the computational audio inside Apple’s latest earbuds model, the tuning engineers believe these AirPods provide the most authentic sound thus far in the company’s lineup because the team has been able to reduce so much of the variation across users and fits.</p>
<p>To create a sound profile that’s exciting for customers and still maintains all of that authenticity, the media tuning team listens to thousands of hours of music, movies, podcasts and YouTube videos in mono, stereo and Dolby Atmos. There’s also a lot of vinyl lining the shelves of these tuning studios. During the development process, the team will test multiple versions of hardware with tons of tuning variations using computational audio. The goal is for all of the tuning decisions to translate better to all users, with a desire that everyone hears the same sound from Apple’s products.</p>
<p>In addition to listening to music through speakers and headphones, microphones are also important to the tuning work. In order to create features like the studio-quality audio recording on AirPods Pro, the team captured clips from the earbuds in the studio and out in the real world before comparing them with benchmarks from high-end recording mics. That analysis allows the engineers to translate pro-grade audio features for consumer products like AirPods. Studio-quality audio, for example, replaces a lavalier with your earbuds for iPhone videos. It won’t ever replace a studio microphone, obviously, but it does put more capable audio tools in your pocket.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-completely-silent-room">The completely silent room</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/c5eec4d0-9358-11f0-aeff-ba57137c1498" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/c5eec4d0-9358-11f0-aeff-ba57137c1498" style="height:1920px;width:2560px;" alt="A setup for testing spatial audio inside the anechoic chamber." data-uuid="49acb212-6869-377c-91f0-de1acbd4c3ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>An important part of testing Apple’s audio products, and features like spatial audio, is to use them in a completely silent room. Known as an anechoic chamber, it’s a room within a room that’s physically separated from the rest of the building. This is essential because things like footsteps in the hall or cars driving by outside can create vibrational noise that would otherwise be transmitted into the chamber.</p>
<p>Inside, foam wedges on the walls, floor and ceiling absorb all sound that’s emitted in the space. There’s no echo (hence the name “anechoic”), so voices and claps just die. In fact, you have to walk on a suspended grid that looks like wire fencing, because the true &quot;floor&quot; of the room is more foam wedges meant to absorb sonic reflections from below. It’s an off-putting space to spend time in, since it looks like something out of a sci-fi movie — not to mention the lack of reverb.</p>
<p>Over the decades that Apple has been designing and manufacturing electronics, the company has learned a lot about all of the unwanted noise that its devices make. The anechoic chamber allows a dedicated team of acoustic engineers to listen very carefully to products like AirPods to determine if any sounds are unintended. They collaborate with other engineering teams to make sure the product isn’t doing anything the company doesn’t intend for it to do.</p>
<p>The anechoic chamber is also a vital part of spatial audio development. In its current configuration, there’s a chair in the room with a ring of tiny speakers around it. Engineers study the variable physiology of test subjects, like the way sound bounces off the body and around the inside of their ears. To then create the perception of sound coming from a particular direction, the team uses computational audio and signal processing to create the ideal angle for a person’s hearing signature. This sort of analysis was directly responsible for <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">Personalized Spatial Audio</a>, which takes a scan from an iPhone camera and analyzes it with various models and algorithms to tailor the sound to each person.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-fantasia-lab-verifying-anc-transparency-mode-and-spatial-audio">Fantasia Lab: Verifying ANC, transparency mode and spatial audio</h2>
<p>The last stop on my tour was the most visually and sonically appealing. This room is called the Fantasia Lab, named for the first film that used surround sound. The name also speaks to the Apple engineers’ ability to generate (or simulate) any sound they can think of with the room’s spherical speaker setup. The audio lab team used this room to verify features on the AirPods Pro 3, including transparency mode, active noise cancellation (ANC) and spatial audio.</p>
<p>The array of dozens of loudspeakers enable the engineers to assess whether environmental sounds in transparency mode are as accurate and natural as possible. The team will have someone sit inside the sphere and have them indicate which direction the audio is coming from to eliminate any issues with the feature. To gauge ANC performance, different types of sounds at various volumes are piped in. This gives the engineers insight into the workings of the adaptation and oversight algorithms, the bits of software employed to make sure the ANC is steadily and effectively blocking as much noise as possible. And for spatial audio, the team will play sounds at different locations and angles from real speakers before trying to recreate the perception that sound is coming from the same place inside of the AirPods.</p>
<p>I was able to take a seat for a few seconds to get a sense of what the Fantasia Lab is capable of. One of the engineers played a live recording of a concert in spatial audio. With speakers all around me, sound was coming from all directions — including the roar of the crowd singing along. I closed my eyes and I was there, vibing to Omar Apollo with tens of thousands of people. Except, of course, I wasn’t. I was surrounded by speakers in a small room with four other people, through a maze of corridors, tucked into one of Apple’s myriad buildings around Cupertino.</p>
<p>Imagine my disappointment when I opened my eyes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/inside-the-apple-audio-lab-where-airpods-are-tested-and-tuned-150025891.html?src=rss]]></description>

So when a serious discount is available, we tend to sit up and take notice. Now, you can get a whopping half off an annual subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount Plus;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=855ca62e-ee52-453f-91a1-14fbe4f4bd6a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;linkText=Paramount%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1NWNhNjJlLWVlNTItNDUzZi05MWExLTE0ZmJlNGY0YmQ2YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFyYW1vdW50cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOKUU1vXUXbEUW7l4rCKNUFLhf9Zv8VyJSYD7ySdLSg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.paramountplus.com/">Paramount+</a> through September 18. A year of the Paramount+ Essential plan, which is ad-supported, will cost $30 compared to the usual $60. Paramount+ Premium, which is ad-free except for live tv programming, will cost $60 for a year instead of $120.</p>

<p>This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer. Anyone who signs up for a year-long subscription to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">Paramount+</a> from now through September 18 will be able to get this pricing. The only real caveat with this deal is that you have to pay for the full year in advance; month-to-month subscriptions will still cost the usual rate.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Paramount+ has some great programming options, particularly if you're a fan of anything involving RuPaul. It's also the home of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-third-season-falls-short-of-its-second-020030139.html"><em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-lower-decks-ends-on-a-new-beginning-140003832.html"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, which are arguably the best modern additions to the sci-fi show's canon, as well as the other past and present <em>Star Trek</em> series. The platform offers a solid lineup of sports as well. And if you opt to go for the Premium plan, you'll also be granted access to Showtime titles such as <em>Yellowjackets</em> and the rebooted <em>Dexter: Resurrection</em>.</p>

The existence of a specially-made battery pack wasn’t a big surprise to me, because there had been rumors of the iPhone Air for months leading up to the event. Everyone was prepared for the thinnest iPhone ever to make some battery life sacrifices to achieve its svelte design.</p>
<p>However, what was a surprise to me was how much Apple leaned on the new battery during the iPhone Air launch presentation. The company even lists battery life estimates with and without this optional battery pack in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e343be7-2fb5-4f3c-aad9-a0b78b96e83a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+specs&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vaXBob25lLWFpci9zcGVjcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJlMzQzYmU3LTJmYjUtNGYzYy1hYWQ5LWEwYjc4Yjk2ZTgzYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2lwaG9uZS1haXIvc3BlY3MvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdHx5_9iQCkVXhxZiJADVkZ9fbjCBR6xZmx0C_HAWjYt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-air%2Fspecs%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/specs/">iPhone Air specs</a>. That tells me — and regular consumers — that the battery pack is a highly-recommended purchase on a good day and downright necessary on a bad day for all iPhone Air owners.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, folks spending $999 (or more) on an iPhone Air should plan to pony up another $99 for this specially designed battery pack? I’m here to tell you that’s a ridiculous notion and that you shouldn’t do it, especially when there are so many other options available at lower prices.</p>
<p>To be clear, I personally haven’t tried out the iPhone Air with this battery pack. My colleague Sam Rutherford has (check out his <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air review</a>), and he thinks it’s a great fit for the iPhone Air. In particular, he likes some of the (admittedly) smart features Apple included like the battery&#39;s ability to charge itself and the phone simultaneously while the phone is plugged in, and that it can wirelessly top up a pair of AirPods Pro 3. However, he does acknowledge that the math simply ain’t mathin’ on this one when it comes to value for money.</p>
<p>The $99 iPhone Air MagSafe Battery has a 3,149 mAh, according to the information written on the power bank itself. That comes out to about $0.03 per milliampere hours. Let’s compare that to one of the top picks in our guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html">best MagSafe power banks</a>, this <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0F8HXYD46&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e343be7-2fb5-4f3c-aad9-a0b78b96e83a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Nano+battery&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRjhIWFlENDYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJlMzQzYmU3LTJmYjUtNGYzYy1hYWQ5LWEwYjc4Yjk2ZTgzYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEY4SFhZRDQ2LyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb4lIkv83squjKxK-1NWWRglBbBiKe1bjHPww4uLTRnN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0F8HXYD46%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8HXYD46/">Anker Nano battery</a>: that 5,000 mAh pack is priced at $55, which comes out to $0.01 per milliampere hours. Even the watt-hour rating (Whr) on Apple’s pack is lower: 12.26Whr, as compared to 25Whr on this Anker option. And don&#39;t forget, the Anker pack isn&#39;t exclusively made for the iPhone Air — it, like other magnetic power banks, can be used with other iPhones and smartphones.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, Apple’s Air MagSafe Battery tops out at 12W wireless charging unless it’s plugged in while powering the phone up and can employ help from passthrough USB-C charging. The Anker pack is Qi2-certified for up to 15W of wireless charging, and since the iPhone Air supports up to 20W of wireless power, that means Anker&#39;s accessory could deliver its full 15 watts when snapped to the back of the Air.</p>
<p>Not only are you getting nearly double the mAh capacity for half the price with the Anker option (and faster charging to boot), but the numbers become even more ridiculous if you consider (hypothetically), what a larger Apple-made battery pack could cost. With those numbers, a 5K Apple MagSafe battery would cost $150 and a 10K bank would set you back $300. Imagine paying those prices for any other power bank made by any other company — it’s laughable, and we should treat it as such.</p>
<p>Now, is this out of character for Apple to make an overpriced accessory? Absolutely not. But this is different from a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e343be7-2fb5-4f3c-aad9-a0b78b96e83a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=%2499+Milanese+Loop+band&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HSjI0QU0vQS80Nm1tLW5hdHVyYWwtbWlsYW5lc2UtbG9vcC1zLW0_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&amp;signature=AQAAAT3sEQBLR8CiS5WLYKe4NNHiM7RbxLP4LaQJZdLv-RDL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMGJ24AM%2FA%2F46mm-natural-milanese-loop-s-m%3Ffnode%3D7749fa429872a62a65b9d9410622676b28c344740f19321cc6461e9eb39daaa8b93b9b3ef800d112667050e3f023356cd346260ede2aa8c2c352a92a7e7b98276878b0a6644ae74d4085bd379a269f5e1a8e99c2f95340ca03001b04f4541dce" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGJ24AM/A/46mm-natural-milanese-loop-s-m?fnode=7749fa429872a62a65b9d9410622676b28c344740f19321cc6461e9eb39daaa8b93b9b3ef800d112667050e3f023356cd346260ede2aa8c2c352a92a7e7b98276878b0a6644ae74d4085bd379a269f5e1a8e99c2f95340ca03001b04f4541dce">$99 Milanese Loop band</a> for Apple Watch or even a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e343be7-2fb5-4f3c-aad9-a0b78b96e83a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=%24250+Magic+Keyboard&amp;custData=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_Zm5vZGU9NDViMWVmNzYwNWZiMzJmOThhNDFjNjYwYTE0NmQyODFkODRiYTk0ZTVhY2NjYjczMmUzOTExYjlmZTJjZGY2OGE0NTJmMzNhNTljNTBlMDQzNjRiODM0MjkzYjUyYzBhYzI4ZTE2OGFmZmE3ZjdiNzY5MTVkMTIyNmM2MTllZWYwYjYzZTVkZGQ2NGFkNzhhZTY0MTMyMTRlYjFmM2I3NTRmOTUzN2RkMjRkNTQ2NDlkNTA1MDU4ZDFmNTM5YWY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAARoUrqRwxkuH-vG3Gm5KJaFXjKYF2NJrj80T6zVGsSje&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMQDP3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-a16-us-english%3Ffnode%3D45b1ef7605fb32f98a41c660a146d281d84ba94e5acccb732e3911b9fe2cdf68a452f33a59c50e04364b834293b52c0ac28e168affa7f7b76915d1226c619eef0b63e5ddd64ad78ae6413214eb1f3b754f9537dd24d54649d505058d1f539af5" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQDP3LL/A/magic-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-a16-us-english?fnode=45b1ef7605fb32f98a41c660a146d281d84ba94e5acccb732e3911b9fe2cdf68a452f33a59c50e04364b834293b52c0ac28e168affa7f7b76915d1226c619eef0b63e5ddd64ad78ae6413214eb1f3b754f9537dd24d54649d505058d1f539af5">$250 Magic Keyboard</a> for iPad.

Soon enough, people were asking the company why the tool wasn't included in their </span><a target="_blank" rel="" class="link rapid-with-clickid rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d04ee147-4f5e-46e8-87d8-a09664193cff&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Unlimited+subscription&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9wcmljaW5nIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMDRlZTE0Ny00ZjVlLTQ2ZTgtODdkOC1hMDk2NjQxOTNjZmYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcHJvdG9uLm1lL3ByaWNpbmcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYMaavHrJmD-UZyWI0jkpey2Ta-V9K0pv0ekxA0keOqr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fproton.me%2Fpricing" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Unlimited subscription</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">. Internally, Scribe also changed how Proton thought about AI. Proton released its mail client in 2014, almost exactly 10 years after the debut of Gmail in 2004. Proton Drive, meanwhile, arrived in 2020 or eight years after Google Drive. The company felt it couldn't be late to chatbots too.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">"We knew we needed to move faster on this because it's going to be a big privacy problem in the future," said Maguire, pointing to the monetization arc of past platforms like Gmail. After cornering the email market, Google turned to ads and selling user data to fund Gmail's operations. It's a familiar scenario, and one Maguire argues we're already seeing play out again with AI chatbots, with Elon Musk </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/elon-musk-says-x-plans-to-introduce-ads-in-groks-responses/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">recently telling</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> advertisers that xAI would display sponsored responses alongside regular content from Grok. In other words, the enshitification of AI chatbots has already begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">The growing strength of open-source models is one of the reasons Maguire believes Proton can compete against the likes of OpenAI and Google. Open systems, particularly those coming out of China, may lag behind proprietary models in user adoption but they're beginning to match them in testing benchmarks. For instance, </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Zhipu AI's GLM-4.5</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> currently sits top 10 overall on </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">LMArena</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">. At the same time, "all the top models are starting to cluster together in benchmarks now," Maguire says. Even accounting for some of the safety issues with Chinese models "Overall, open systems are competing, not just tailgating [closed models]."</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Lumo employs a combination of smaller open-source models that require fewer resources to run — specifically Nemo, OpenHands 32B, OLMO 2 32B, and Mistral Small 3. Maguire argues Proton's approach allows it to be nimble. That's important for a company that hasn't raised venture capital funding, and needs to think about building a sustainable business model from the start. "A lot of people think they need the best model to get the best responses. But I think it's been shown that you can get very capable responses from models that are smaller," Maguire said.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">For consumers, that also means Proton can offer Lumo for less. Like most chatbots, basic features are available for free, with the option to remove rate and token limits through a paid subscription. For Lumo, that costs $13 — less than $20 per month most AI companies charge for their basic paid plans, and substantially less than the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-joins-anthropic-and-openai-in-offering-a-200-per-month-subscription-191715149.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">$200 tier</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> many of them have begun offering for nearly unlimited usage of their models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Maguire suggests thinking about it this way: You could drive a Formula One car to the grocery store, but that would be overkill. If you find LLMs useful in your workflow, there's a good chance a state-of-the-art model like </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-o3-and-o4-mini-models-are-all-about-thinking-with-images-170043465.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">OpenAI's o3</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> is similarly overkill for your needs. Unless you're a researcher, you probably don't need a system that can reason over many minutes to tackle a complex problem.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Similarly, if you're just driving a sedan or crossover to complete errands, then what better represents the neighborhood you live in digitally than your email and, perhaps, your cloud storage. Lumo gains some benefit from being baked into that environment, in the same way many AI companies are attempting to layer their chatbots on top of desktop and mobile operating systems.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">The other reason Maguire feels that Proton has a shot against established chatbots is because, at the end of the day, they're all just tools —&nbsp;some better equipped for certain tasks than others. For example, Anthropic's Claude systems are great at coding, but they don't offer image generation. As platforms, chatbots also don't benefit from </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">network effects</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> in quite the same way (or sometimes at all, depending on their user data training policies) that social networks do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">It should come as no surprise then at least one of the AI giants is trying to change that. In April, <em>The Verge </em>reported that OpenAI was </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-apparently-making-a-social-network-175842370.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">testing a version of ChatGPT</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> that includes a social feed to image generation. Whether users want such a thing remains to be seen, as gluing social elements to an unrelated product often fails (</span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-12-goodbye-google-plus-you-beautiful-squandered-opportunity.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">see: Google+</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">). Without social features, maybe consumers will have an easier time jumping between these tools, especially as they become cluttered with ads or engage in more egregious privacy violations.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">At this point in our conversation, I'm still not convinced Lumo might carve out a niche for itself. I think of Mozilla and its recent string of bad news, from layoffs affecting its </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/mozilla-foundation-cuts-30-percent-of-its-staff-203951504.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">advocacy group</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> to the shutdown of </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/mozilla-is-shutting-down-its-read-it-later-app-pocket-183247576.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Pocket</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">. Firefox is arguably a better browser than Chrome, with privacy features like </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/firefox-enables-anti-tracking-feature-by-default-130033590.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">robust anti-tracking</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"> built right into the app. However, it has a fraction of the market share.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">There's also the AGI-sized elephant in the room. In the pursuit of models that can match or exceed human intelligence at most tasks, AI companies are engaged in a contest where there can only be one winner, burning enormous sums of cash to exceed human intelligence through silicon and paying a king's ransom to hire the top minds in the field to achieve that. In that context, what chance does a small player like Proton stand?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Once again, the family sedan stands to beat the sportscar, or perhaps a spaceship to extend the metaphor. "If your goal is to help people become more productive and learn better, do you need AGI? Probably not," said Maguire. "We're not under the illusion that everyone is going to switch from ChatGPT to Lumo. Our goal is to provide the best ecosystem where people can do the most amount of things within a privacy-preserving mantra."</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><a target="_blank" rel="" class="link rapid-with-clickid rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d04ee147-4f5e-46e8-87d8-a09664193cff&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=As+of+2023&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9ibG9nL3Byb3Rvbi0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1hY2NvdW50cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDA0ZWUxNDctNGY1ZS00NmU4LTg3ZDgtYTA5NjY0MTkzY2ZmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9ibG9nL3Byb3Rvbi0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1hY2NvdW50cyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeG4O8zR29OmorTsjvOmxgt1Ln2H4ajlZApWM2fICNJs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fproton.me%2Fblog%2Fproton-100-million-accounts" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">As of 2023</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">, Proton Mail had 100 million users. It's a far cry from the more than 2 billion people using Gmail, but I don't think anyone could convincingly argue Proton Mail is a failure. The company is still going strong, and now competing in a space people like Sam Altman would have you believe requires a trillion dollars of investment. If Proton can prove AI doesn't need to be "the antithesis of privacy," as Maguire believes it can, that might be enough to call Lumo a success too.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/with-lumo-proton-thinks-it-can-carve-a-place-at-the-ai-table-130000740.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">We were </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">pretty underwhelmed by the iPhone 16e</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> when it debuted earlier this year, mostly due to its $599 price tag, which makes it a poor replacement for the budget-oriented iPhone SE. And now that the iPhone 17 has debuted, the 16e makes even less sense. For $200 more, you get a larger and better screen with ProMotion, support for MagSafe wireless charging, a zippier processor, two cameras instead of one — <em>and</em> double the storage. Sure, that price difference hurts a bit, but I think the iPhone 17 is still a better deal since it's not nearly as limiting as the iPhone 16e, which should have been priced closer to $500 to take on something like the Pixel 9a.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Last fall, I argued that the </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/its-a-good-year-to-buy-the-vanilla-iphone-16-and-avoid-the-se-at-all-costs-192919611.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">vanilla iPhone 16</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> was a smart buy given its revamped CPU and support for Apple Intelligence, and I think that remains true for the iPhone 17 with its many new features and identical price point. While I'm sure Apple would love for more customers to jump to the $999 iPhone Air or $1,099 </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html">iPhone 17 Pro</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">, it's still hard for a lot of people to stomach spending four figures on a smartphone. The ultra-thin Air will likely be a hit with influencers and the style-obsessed, and power users will have a ball with the iPhone 17 Pro's more capable camera array. For everyone else, the iPhone 17 remains a solid device that will serve you well for many years.</span></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The addition of ProMotion support alone removes one of the feature gaps between the plain iPhone and the Pro models. It allows for a variable screen refresh rate of up to 120Hz, compared to the 60Hz limit of previous years. In practice, that means that scrolling through websites and your social media feeds will look smoother and less headache-inducing. You'll notice the difference immediately -- 60Hz screens look unbearably choppy and slow once your eyes have gotten used to something faster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">And before Android fans jump in to brag — <em>yes</em>, we know that mid-range Android phones have offered high refresh rate screens for years. Apple is undoubtedly slow to react here, but the upgrade is still worth celebrating. The iPhone 17's screen isn't just smoother than before, it genuinely looks better, according to Engadget Senior Reporter Billy Steele. "</span><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The difference between this new model and my iPhone 16 Plus was immediately apparent," he wrote </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-hands-on-no-plus-no-problem-192747122.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">in his hands-on.</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> "</span><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Colors are more vivid, details are sharper and it's just more pleasant to look at."</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">When it comes to cameras, the iPhone 17 improves its ultrawide shooter to 48 megapixels, joining the 48MP main sensor. But the big camera upgrade is actually on the front of the phone, thanks to the new Center Stage camera. It's been bumped to 18MP from 12MP, but more importantly, Apple also introduced a square sensor that lets you jump from landscape to portrait orientations without rotating your phone. I've </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-square-selfie-camera-is-a-bigger-deal-than-you-think-151517041.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">already gone deep</span></a><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> on why the square selfie sensor (which is available on all iPhone 17 models) is a big deal, but here's one key takeaway: "By making it easier to take selfies, it follows that you'll start to take even more of them, ultimately tying yourself into Apple's ecosystem even further."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">And speaking of features available on all of the new iPhones, the vanilla iPhone 17 also supports Dual Capture, which lets you record video using the front and rear cameras at the same time. Center Stage keeps your face in the middle of the frame during those shots as well, which might make Apple’s implementation of Dual Capture more effective than what we’ve seen from Samsung and other phone makers. I could have seen Apple gatekeeping this feature for the more powerful </span><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air</a><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> and 17 Pro models, but it's nice to see it on the vanilla entry. Similar to selfies, it only benefits Apple if you're using your devices more to produce content, and I could see Dual Capture footage becoming a big deal on Instagram and TikTok.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">While Apple is keeping the iPhone 16 around at $699, it genuinely makes more sense to jump straight to the $799 iPhone 17 for all of the reasons mentioned above. (But if you find a good deal on a refurbished iPhone 16, that’s another story. It’s still a very capable phone, and it’s compatible with Apple Intelligence features as well.) Aside from lowering the price – something I don’t see Apple ever doing – there’s not much else the iPhone 17 is missing. And for anyone who needs something more fashionable or powerful, the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro are right there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(29, 34, 40);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The only missing hole in the iPhone lineup is a budget option that’s cheaper than the $599 iPhone 16e – hopefully, that’ll be something a future iPhone 17e might be able to solve.</span></p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has reportedly banned the country&#39;s local tech companies from purchasing NVIDIA&#39;s newest AI chip made for the region. According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/12adf92d-3e34-428a-8d61-c9169511915c"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, the internet regulator told Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cancel their orders for and to stop testing NVIDIA&#39;s RTX Pro 6000D. After receiving the directive from CAC, the companies reportedly told their suppliers to stop all activities related to the GPU. As <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/china-tells-tech-firms-stop-buying-nvidias-ai-chips-ft-reports-2025-09-17/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, the ban is stronger than the &quot;guidance&quot; the regulator issued against the company&#39;s older H20 chips for the country. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is disappointed by the ban, the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxz29pe1v0o"><em>BBC</em></a> reports. &quot;There are a lot of places we can&#39;t go to, and that&#39;s fine,&quot; he told reporters. He also said he would &quot;support the US&quot; as it resolves its geopolitical issues with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese companies had previously indicated that they would be ordering and testing tens of thousands of the AI chip based on NVIDIA&#39;s Blackwell architecture. <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidias-new-rtx6000d-chip-china-finds-little-favour-with-major-firms-sources-say-2025-09-16/"><em>Reuters</em></a> recently reported, however, that it has received lukewarm demand and that some tech firms decided not to put in orders for the product altogether. Some of the companies are apparently holding out for NVIDIA&#39;s B30A, which is a more powerful model, to be approved for export by US authorities.<em> The Times </em>says Chinese regulators also recently concluded that local-made AI chips are now comparable to or have even exceeded the counterparts NVIDIA is selling in their country. They reportedly gathered domestic chipmakers, including Huawei and Baidu, to ask for a report on how their products compared against NVIDIA&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;ll recall, the US <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-says-the-us-has-put-export-restrictions-on-h20-ai-chips-224822930.html">put an export restriction</a> on NVIDIA&#39;s H20 AI chips in April, out of concerns that China could use it to develop AI tech for its military. In July, the US government allowed the company to export the chips again, reportedly after <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-may-give-us-government-a-cut-of-its-profits-to-sell-ai-chips-to-china-120003260.html">closing a deal</a> that would give it 15 percent of the sales. Huang also introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in Beijing during his visit at the time. It wasn&#39;t the comeback NVIDIA was hoping for, however. Chinese regulators issued a guidance, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html">dissuading</a> local companies from purchasing the H20 chips, allegedly because they were insulted by statements made by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. By the end of August, <em>The Information</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-reportedly-stops-production-of-h20-ai-chips-133020132.html">reported</a> that the company asked its suppliers to halt production related to the H20.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ban comes days after another Chinese regulator accused NVIDIA of <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-says-nvidias-mellanox-acquisition-violated-antitrust-law-200409929.html">violating China&#39;s antitrust laws</a> over its acquisition of chipmaker Mellanox. The State Administration for Market Regulation said the company breached both national regulations and the conditions China set when it originally approved the acquisition. Those terms stated that NVIDIA must continue supplying GPUs and other products to the country and adhering to &quot;fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory principles&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-bans-tech-companies-from-buying-nvidias-ai-chips-120143740.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DJI&#39;s flagship Mini 5 Pro consumer drone has arrived and it&#39;s the first in the series with a 1-inch sensor camera for improved low-light video. Nearly every other feature has been updated as well, including the obstacle detection, range, subject tracking and more — all for around the same price as its predecessor, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-mavic-4-pro-review-a-new-standard-for-consumer-drones-120006235.html">the Mini 4 Pro</a>. I&#39;ve had the drone for just enough time to give some quick thoughts (stay tuned for a full review later), but so far it looks like DJI has outdone itself again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini 5 Pro is a bit bigger and sits higher than the Mini 4 Pro, but it&#39;s still under 250 grams (249.9 to be exact) so you don&#39;t need a permit to fly it. A key new feature is the LiDAR sensors installed in the nose to detect and avoid obstacles when flying at night in light as low as 1 lux, while allowing RTH (return to home) in low light, even without a GPS signal. It also has six omni sensors to detect obstacles in every direction to keep the drone safe during ActiveTrack 360 and other types of flying in tight quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/443f0e50-93a7-11f0-bb7f-a2be7a6454cf" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/443f0e50-93a7-11f0-bb7f-a2be7a6454cf" style="height:1865px;width:2800px;" alt="DJI Mini 5 Pro drone" data-uuid="ecf51a44-e5e0-3882-8561-b5ab7096b879"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The camera nacelle is noticeably larger to accommodate the 1-inch 50MP sensor that&#39;s a big step up from the 1/1.3-inch sensor on the Mini 4 Pro. It&#39;s the same size as the sensor <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-air-3s-review-lidar-and-improved-image-quality-make-for-a-nearly-faultless-drone-130002876.html">on the Air 3S</a>, bringing improved low light capability and finer detail to a lower priced drone. However, video resolution is only slightly up from the Mini 4 Pro to 4K at 120 fps max, up from 100 fps before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 10-bit D-LogM capture, it promises dynamic range up to 14 stops for easier grading. The extra resolution also allowed DJI to boost zoom to 2x without any noticeable loss in resolution. The company also added an enhanced portrait mode that optimizes brightness, contrast and skin tone performance to the level of the company&#39;s best-selling <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-osmo-pocket-3-review-maybe-the-only-vlogging-camera-you-need-163028145.html">Pocket 3 gimbal cam</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gimbal now rolls up to 225 degrees to allow true vertical video and let users capture rotating footage, while offering support for intelligent modes like QuickShot Rotate, Timelapse, Spotlight and Waypoint Flight. DJI also upgraded its ActiveTrack 360 function for tracking subjects while doing camera moves, making it safer and more stable while balancing speed and agility. Specifically, DJI says that during cycling it offers a &quot;more agile response and keeps the target firmly locked.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Battery life has improved to 36 minutes or 52 minutes with the Intelligent Flight Battery Plus (available in the US but not Europe and elsewhere). However, it offers a noticeably shorter charging time of just 115 minutes for three batteries (38.3 minutes per battery) with the two-way charging hub and DJI 65W portable charger. The maximum transmission distance via DJI&#39;s O4+ system is unchanged at 20 km in the US (12.4 miles) or 10 km in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mini 5 Pro ships with either the standard RC-N3 controller or the RC-2 screen controller that first appeared with the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-3-review-a-high-quality-zoom-adds-new-creative-options-130020261.html">DJI Air 3 mid-sized drone</a>. I&#39;d recommend the RC-2 if you can afford it (it adds $129 to the price), as it&#39;s far more convenient and the screen is bright enough to use on sunny days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I received a Mini 5 Pro in the Fly More combo with three batteries, a charger and the RC-2 screen controller, along with with extra propellers and the ND filter kit, and flew it a few times to briefly test the video quality and ActiveTrack 360 capabilities. So far, I&#39;m impressed. Video and photo quality has noticeably improved with lower noise, sharper detail and more accurate color rendering. Dynamic range is also higher in sunny conditions when shooting with the D-LogM setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the biggest difference appears to be shooting at dusk. Where the Mini 4 Pro delivered video with excessive noise or splotchy colors due to the aggressive noise reduction, the Mini 5 Pro offers relatively clean video up to ISO 3200 or even ISO 6400. While grain is very noticeable at the new highest ISO setting of 12,800, video is certainly usable with enough available light. Most importantly for many shooters, cityscapes at night are much cleaner than before with higher detail, lower noise and more saturated colors than the last model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My brief tests of DJI&#39;s new LiDAR and ActiveTrack 360 capabilities were also successful. The Mini 5 Pro did a better job of avoiding fine branches than before and its algorithms took it on smooth and safe trajectories when I manually set the camera angles. The result was smoother and more interesting footage of someone walking and running around trees. At night, the LiDAR did do a good job of keeping the drone away from obstacles, however I found it to be a bit too conservative. For instance, one time with no obstacles around it except a wall, it refused to move in any direction.</p>
<p>Battery life, noise levels and other factors still require testing, but so far the Mini 5 Pro looks like a solid successor to the Mini 4 Pro, which sold like hotcakes. Once again, DJI hasn&#39;t officially released the drone in the US but like DJI&#39;s Mic 3, it could be available later at major retailers like Amazon. It&#39;s on sale in Europe for €799/£689 with a battery, €999/£869 in the fly More Combo with the DJI RC-N3 controller and €1,129/£979 in the same combo with the RC-2 controller. More information about US pricing will be released as soon as it&#39;s available.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-mini-pro-5-drone-is-the-first-in-the-series-with-a-1-inch-sensor-120026323.html?src=rss]]></description>

Sure, it’s got a bigger screen and it's unbelievably sleek, but no matter how you slice it, that value proposition doesn’t make sense. At least on paper. That’s because as soon as you hold an iPhone Air, you instantly get a sense that this handset represents much more than a simple quest for thinness. The iPhone Air is a device with a mission: To push the company’s design and engineering further than ever before while doubling down on style. Plus, it’s potentially laying the foundation for something even more radical down the line.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-the-iphone-air">What is the iPhone Air?</h2> 
<p>New iPhones generally don't need to be explained, but the Air is a different sort of iPhone. On a purely practical level, it could be viewed as a (very) glowed-up replacement to the iPhone 16 Plus. However, the Air starts at $999, which is $100 more than the launch price of last year's closest Apple equivalent (or $200 more after its recent price drop). Furthermore, the Air has a smaller 6.5-inch display (versus 6.7 inches on the 16 Plus) and only a single rear camera instead of the two you typically get on a base model iPhone. Then, to make things a touch more confusing, the Air has nearly the same A19 Pro chip used in Apple's Pro series this year instead of a regular A19 processor. But most importantly, the Air’s design is unlike any iPhone that's come before it, and it may end up becoming a bridge to Apple's next era of smartphones (while also being irresistibly thin and stylish today).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-simply-stunning">Design: Simply stunning</h2> 
<p>Even with the arrival of Samsung's super sleek <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> earlier this year, Apple is setting new highs for mobile design with the iPhone Air. Not only is it even skinnier at just 5.6mm (versus 5.8mm for the S25E), it's the best example yet of what I like to call “the sci-fi space pebble look” thanks to its rounded corners and beautifully polished edges. It's a proper marvel of engineering and while I generally don't like saying this, you really do have to hold one to fully appreciate Apple's craftsmanship.</p> 
<p>Despite its dimensions, the Air isn't all sleekness and no strength. You still get a full IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, while the titanium frame makes the whole handset remarkably sturdy. On top of that, the Air has a screen covered by a new Ceramic Shield 2 panel that also comes with an anti-reflective coating. And while it doesn't completely eliminate glare, it does a good job of preventing annoying bright spots.</p>

<p>As for the display itself, there's not much to complain about here either. The Air's screen has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and it has ProMotion support with a refresh rate that varies between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the situation. But the real impact is that when you put a display this good in a device this thin, sometimes it really does look like someone has ripped a page out of a magazine and made it float in your hand. It's kind of uncanny and I can't get enough. To be fair, Samsung's S25 Edge does produce a similar effect but it isn't quite as pronounced.</p> 
<p>I also appreciate that Apple still found room for the iPhone's Action button and a flush Camera Control key. Around back, there's subtle sophistication in the way the Air's Ceramic Shield rear panel slopes up gently to create Apple's camera plateau (though I don't love that name). And weighing just 5.82 ounces (165 grams), the Air's heft (or lack thereof) adds even more to its ethereal in-hand feel.</p>

<p>My main issue with the Air's design is that it only has a single mono speaker. Granted, it packs a punch both in terms of volume and presence, but after years of stereo sound being the de facto equipment on premium smartphones, one-sided audio doesn't sit quite right. The other potential sore spot is that the Air's USB-C port isn't perfectly centered in the bottom edge. But I fully admit that this is the most minor of nitpicks, and when you consider that due to the Air's thinness Apple had to 3D-print the connector out of titanium (a first for the company), I'm not bothered.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-performance-way-better-than-good-enough">Performance: Way better than good enough</h2> 
<p>Compared to the base iPhone 17, the Air has a more powerful A19 Pro chip. However, unlike the silicon available in the iPhone 17 Pro line, the Air's processor has one fewer GPU core (five instead of six). But even with that small shortfall, the phone was never hurting for speed. Flipping between apps is essentially instantaneous and thanks to the new Liquid Glass visual design in iOS 26, doing so looks better than ever.</p>

<p>More intense tasks like gaming didn't do much to slow it down either. Frame rates remained stable in demanding titles like<em> Destiny: Rising</em> while more casual fare like <em>Sword of Convallaria</em> looked effortlessly fluid. The only time the phone seemed mildly taxed was when using tools like Apple's Image Playground. Just watch out if when do you any high performance tasks for a prolonged time, because the the Air can get a bit warm — particularly on its camera bump. Thankfully, in my experience, it never got too hot to touch.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, the addition of Apple's new N1 and C1X chips rounds out the package that the company claims makes this the most power-efficient iPhone yet. That's important because without a vapor chamber like on the Pro line, or room for a large battery, the Air doesn't have much leeway for excess heat or power draw. The downside is that Apple's C1X modem doesn't support mmWave 5G. This may not be an issue depending on where you live or what network you're on, but for those demanding peak mobile data speeds, it is something worth considering before upgrading.</p>

<p>The photos and videos the iPhone Air takes are excellent. But at the end of the day, there still isn't a real replacement for more glass, and with only a single lens in back, Apple's lone 48MP rear camera may be the phone's biggest limitation. In a shot of some homemade cookies, details were sharp and colors were so rich that my mouth was still watering long after the treats were eaten. Same goes for a tricky photo at sunset, where the Air still managed to capture the warmth and subtle tones of the day's fading light. And at night, it kept pace with or even outshot its biggest rivals, including the Pixel 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge — like in my image of a local mural and flower in low-light. However, if you're the kind of person who loves a good telephoto shot or the extra field of view an ultra-wide lens provides, the Air's 2x optical quality zoom means you’re out of luck.</p> 
<p>Impressively, despite only having a single rear camera, the Air still manages to take portrait pics that look practically just as good as those from iPhones with two. Apple says that it reengineered its portrait pipeline to work without the need for stereo cameras for the Air, and it totally works. Now, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice some small discrepancies between the iPhone 17 and the Air on things like flyaway hairs. But in the end, it's nice to see that even without the same number of lenses, there isn't a major drop in quality.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="ce0a3749-dd02-4422-a657-cd4cd7925f2d" /> 
<p>However, in front, Apple's Center Stage feature and the Air's new 18MP selfie cam might be the next big photo revolution that other companies will copy soon. By using a square sensor instead of a rectangular one, the phone can flip between wider landscape shots or taller portrait-style pics at a moment's notice. In fact, there's even an auto setting that allows the phone to switch between the two on its own, depending on how many people are in the frame.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As someone who is selfie-averse, the times that I do want to take a photo of my face are usually when I'm standing in front of a big vista and want to capture myself <em>and </em>the scenery. Center Stage lets me do just that without needing to awkwardly turn the phone on its side. Additionally, while the photos you see here were taken with Apple's default “Standard” Photographic Style, I must admit I like the new "Bright" option in iOS 26, which adds just enough pop and color to your photos without going overboard.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-battery-life-and-charging-not-a-problem">Battery life and charging: Not a problem</h2> 
<p>The iPhone Air's emphasis on thinness means there's less room for a big battery, so you might think longevity would be a concern. But in my experience, it's been a complete non-issue. Officially, Apple doesn't provide specs for the size of the power cells in its devices, though the company does state the Air should provide 27 hours of continuous video playback, which is only three less than what you get from a base iPhone 17. That's a drop of just 10 percent and, considering the sleekness of the Air, it's a trade-off I'm happy to make.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my results generally line up with Apple's numbers. In a streaming video rundown test over Wi-Fi, the iPhone Air lasted 23 hours and 39 minutes — barely an hour less than what I got from a base iPhone 17 (24:45). And in the real world, the Air fared even better than expected. Even on a day with over seven hours of screen on time (which includes running benchmarks and gaming), the phone has 25 percent juice left in the tank. And on lighter days when I'm not working or constantly checking my phone, I often had 40 to 45 percent energy remaining. When it comes to recharging, the Air keeps things simple: a 30-minute charge (either wired or wirelessly) can add 50 percent battery in just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I don't normally mention peripherals during a review, since I'm not a fan of cases but I can understand wanting extra protection for a $1,000 phone. However, I'd argue that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e74d7b28-2cca-4e9c-a86c-a7d60b7be4e6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Apple%27s+MagSafe+Battery+for+the+iPhone+Air&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HUEc0QU0vQS9pcGhvbmUtYWlyLW1hZ3NhZmUtYmF0dGVyeSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTc0ZDdiMjgtMmNjYS00ZTljLWE4NmMtYTdkNjBiN2JlNGU2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9wcm9kdWN0L01HUEc0QU0vQS9pcGhvbmUtYWlyLW1hZ3NhZmUtYmF0dGVyeSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWVZyWbFmxxEYEmZzHEG9PNVKo0Ql8Lkhf179aKvyVwg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMGPG4AM%2FA%2Fiphone-air-magsafe-battery" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGPG4AM/A/iphone-air-magsafe-battery">Apple's MagSafe Battery for the iPhone Air</a> may be an essential accessory for folks who like to travel light but don't want to worry about their electronics dying — even if its $99 price tag stings.</p>

<p>In keeping with the iPhone Air's design, Apple's power pack is exceedingly slim at just 7.5mm and it snaps neatly onto the back of the device magnetically, so there are no wires to worry about. On its own, recharging tops out at 12 watts. Though if there's a cord lying around, you can boost speeds up to the Air's 20-watt limit. Alternatively, you can also use the pack’s built-in USB-C port to power up any of your other gadgets. And when you need to recharge the portable battery, all you have to do is keep it attached to the iPhone while it’s charging and it will automatically pass through juice as needed.</p> 
<p>But my favorite part is that not only does the battery pack refill the iPhone Air, it can recharge the AirPods Pro 3 wirelessly as well. Admittedly, Apple's slim MagSafe Battery doesn't have the biggest capacity at 3,149mAh (which is enough to add an extra 65 percent charge to the phone). So even though you're paying a premium to keep things super thin and breezy, between the handset, the power pack and Apple's latest earbuds, I really appreciate the convenience for what might be the ultimate lightweight travel kit for iPhone faithful.</p>

<p>While the iPhone Air's thinness may be its most striking quality, it's abundantly clear that this handset is so much more than that. Not only does this device represent a radical evolution of Apple's design chops, it forced the company's engineers to come up with more power-efficient solutions to make all this possible. And in that respect, the iPhone Air is a massive success. It's sleek, it's fast and it's wildly stylish in a way that both fashionistas and people who just like packing light can appreciate.</p> 
<p>One interesting wrinkle in all of this is that the true potential of the Air's success might not be truly felt for another year or two. While Apple might not want to say so just yet, I'm willing to bet that this device will also be the template for an upcoming foldable iPhone. You slap two Airs together, connect them with a hinge and a flexible screen and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y">baby you got stew going</a>. That said, for fans of previous Plus models, the Air's increased price, smaller screen and single rear cam certainly aren't ideal. As long as you don't mind the lack of extra lenses, for those who appreciate a powerful but still eminently effervescent mobile companion, the iPhone Air is in another stratosphere.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the sake of this iPhone 17 Pro review, I’ve developed a gaming addiction.</p> 
<p>I don’t mean triple-A games like <em>Destiny: Rising</em> and <em>Genshin Impact</em>, or even double-A or non-A titles like <em>Inside</em> or <em>Vampire Survivors, </em>both of<em>&nbsp;</em>which I greatly enjoy. I’m specifically referring to <em>Snake Clash</em> on YouTube Games — the type of thing you mindlessly play while pretending to watch a documentary on TV, or while sitting on the throne, slowly growing a hemorrhoid.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The reason I’ve been playing so much <em>Snake Clash</em> is because I’ve noticed in my year with an iPhone 16 Pro that countless hours with games like this cause the device to burn up in my hands. And maybe some other title might also push thermal performance in similar ways, but alas, such is my taste. (Also, <em>Inside</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em> never caused my phone to get too warm.)</p> 
<p>I spent a lot of time on the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-hands-on-the-unibody-and-camera-plateau-feel-more-significant-in-person-185553855.html">iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max</a> trying to get them to run hot, because one of the most interesting additions this year is a vapor chamber. That thermal management feature, together with the aluminum unibody redesign and three 48-megapixel rear cameras, is among the most compelling updates for this generation. Throw in the powerful A19 Pro chip (now situated in the “plateau”), a novel Center Stage selfie camera, promises of longer battery life and an eye-catching new color, and frankly the latest Pro phones seem like a serious leap.</p> 
<p>For this review, I focused on the performance, thermal management, camera capabilities and battery life of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. I am bundling them together because aside from screen size, battery capacity and price, the two are functionally identical. I also spent time checking out Apple Intelligence and iOS 26 features, which won’t be exclusive to the new hardware and I’ll refer you to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html">our iOS 26 preview</a> for a deeper dive on.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-an-aluminum-unibody-design-thats-new-and-familiar-all-at-once">An aluminum unibody design that’s new and familiar all at once</h2> 
<p>When I first picked up the iPhone 17 Pro at Apple Park, I found it refreshingly different from the iPhone 16 Pro I’d been using for a year (and also the iPhone 15 Pro before that). But the longer I caressed the matte edges of my review unit, the more I felt sparks of familiarity. The aluminum unibody here reminded me of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-19-iphone-8-and-8-plus-review.html">the iPhone 8</a>, which is no surprise since that device was made of steel wrapped in an aluminum band. Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 17 Pros use the same 7000-series aluminum alloy that’s proprietary to Apple so that makes sense. Of course, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are far from being as thin as the older handset, but something about the matte finish felt great.</p> 
<p>Two weeks before the iPhone launch event, my iPhone 16 Pro slipped out of my hand and crashed to the floor of a grimy public bathroom. It had landed at an awkward angle on its edge and cracked spectacularly. Thankfully, most of the shattered glass was near the bottom edge, while hairline fractures reached up in a strangely pretty pattern to the rear camera module. These didn’t cut my hands, but I knew I wanted the next iPhone to be a lot more durable.</p> 
<p>With its aluminum frame protecting the edges of the rear and back, there is little chance the iPhone 17 Pro will break in the way my iPhone 16 Pro did. Its screen is now protected by Ceramic Shield 2, so if it fell flat on its face it should still be able to survive the impact. The rear is a bit more vulnerable, since the three cameras still protrude slightly from the plateau, but those are covered by the same sapphire crystal that previous models were. I’ve yet to crack an iPhone’s camera despite my years of klutzy behavior.</p> 
<p>This bodes well for the iPhone 17 Pro, though I’ll say I didn’t try very hard to scratch my review unit. I actually went as far as to keep it in the Finewoven case that Apple provided in the first few days so I could maintain a pristine surface for our review photos. After removing the case, I did put both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max in a bag with the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro so I could bring them around while camera testing, and it was pretty nice to be able to identify the newest models simply by touch. For years, I’ve seen Android phones, particularly those by Samsung, grow more and more iPhone-like so the departure from glossy glass is welcome.</p> 
<p>Plus, neither the Pro nor the Pro Max have been scratched despite my placing them, naked, in backpacks or pockets with other phones, keys or badges with hooks in them, though to be fair the same is true of the iPhone 16 Pro until its unfortunate fall.</p> 
<p>One other way the iPhone 17 Pro is distinct? That orange color, which is reminiscent of the Action Button on Apple Watch Ultras. It’s also fairly similar to the hue on some traffic cones, though in a more metallic, burnished way. Because the iPhone 17 Pro is supposed to be so much more durable and scratch-resistant, I’d argue for simply showing off its bold new color by going case-free. I also took a whole bunch of pictures of the orange iPhone 17 Pro Max I’ve been testing in a variety of lighting conditions so you can better understand what it looks like in real life.

<h2 id="jump-link-faster-ai-processing-and-a-body-thats-largely-cooler-to-hold">Faster AI processing and a body that’s largely cooler to hold</h2> 
<p>Apart from the material and the camera plateau, the iPhone 17 Pro’s redesign had a lot to do with thermal management and battery life. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this review, my iPhone 16 Pro runs hot sometimes, especially in recent months. I was eager to see if the vapor chamber in the new devices was effective at keeping them cool in similar situations.</p> 
<p>In general, the iPhone 17 Pro stayed cool — and that’s both during the first few days with the case on and after I removed it altogether. When I played <em>Snake Crash</em> for about 25 minutes, I started noticing some gentle warmth emanating from the camera plateau. I put the device down on a terry cloth blanket and picked up the iPhone 16 Pro to play on instead, and just five minutes later it had gotten as warm as the 17 Pro. Ten minutes later, I had to adjust my fingers so the iPhone 16 Pro didn’t feel like an iron. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro had cooled down in that time despite being on something I usually use to keep warm.</p> 
<p>That’s not to say the iPhone 17 Pro never got noticeably hot in my testing, by the way. In my experience, generating photos in Image Playground or creating Genmoji typically caused my iPhone 16 Pro to heat up to scary levels. On the iPhone 17 Pro, it took a slightly longer time to get as warm, but it did eventually become so hot I felt the need to warn people if I were to hand the device off. I found the aluminum parts of the handset to be the hottest, which makes sense both scientifically and in the way our skin perceives temperatures.</p> 
<p>I do want to commend Apple for the improved performance in Image Playground and Genmoji. It used to take ages for AI-generated pictures or emoji to appear (especially those based on a picture of someone in my photo album), but on the iPhone 17 Pro I was able to get several options in succession before things slowed down. Pictures where I opted to use ChatGPT’s more realistic styles took a lot longer, but by and large I saw a marked improvement in speed here. Those neural accelerators in the A19 Pro’s six-core GPU are certainly pulling their weight.</p> 
<p>It might be worth noting that in the 25 minutes of <em>Snake Clash</em> time, the iPhone 17 Pro’s battery level dropped about ten percent. The iPhone 16 Pro went from 90 percent to 79 percent in roughly the same duration, so power efficiency in this specific use case seems fairly similar.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-camera-performance">Camera performance</h2> 
<p>The trio of 48MP cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are impressively versatile. Not only are they sharp, megapixel-laden sensors that deliver rich detail and vibrant colors, but also pull double duty and provide additional zoom options. When I was shooting on the iPhone 17 Pro, the camera app showed shortcuts for 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x, which is slightly different from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 5x.</p> 
<p>As I mention those two models, I’m deeply aware that most people aren’t going to be considering upgrading from a phone as recent as the iPhone 16 Pro. So I’ll just say that as long as you’re swapping from the iPhone 14 Pro and older, you’ll get a significantly better camera system. For those already on an <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-review-apple-makes-a-strong-case-for-its-biggest-phone-130018980.html">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, it depends on whether you’re using a Max model and care a lot about some extra zooming ability.</p> 
<p>I compared the iPhone 17 Pro mostly to the iPhone 16 Pro to see its improvements, as well as to the Pixel 10 Pro, since I consider it to be the best smartphone camera this year. So far, anyway. As it turns out, the iPhone 17 Pro holds its own against Google’s latest in most situations. In fact, it’s usually a bit better at retaining detail in shadows in photos with high dynamic range.</p> 
<p>Also, as has been the case in the last few generations of iPhones, Apple’s images tend to be warmer and more saturated, whereas Google’s seem a bit muted and gray in comparison. That’s a somewhat subjective observation, really, and likely won’t impact anyone that’s not constantly carrying both phones around.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-all-about-zoom">All about zoom</h3> 
<p>It gets a bit complicated to compare the three phones on their various zoom capabilities, since they all have different limits and dedicated pipelines. But by and large, the iPhones performed similarly at the 1x level, which isn’t surprising given they’re basically the same hardware. They were also pretty closely tied at the 2x level, and further zooms were slightly different from that point.</p> 
<p>I did find that the 8x option on the iPhone 17 Pro delivered clean shots with little noise or blur, and they were well-exposed in general. The fact that I could now go up to 40x compared to the iPhone 16 Pro’s top limit of 25x with digital zoom was a delightful bonus, especially when I was photographing some geese chilling by the river.</p> 
<p>The Pixel 10 Pro’s scene options are 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x and 10x, with Pro Res Zoom allowing you to get all the way up to 100x, if you don’t mind AI filling in some gaps. I would caution against that, given the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1n4uoya/100x_zoom_fail_or_win/">strange things it’s generated so far</a>, but you’ll also still be able to use Super Res Zoom for up to 20x zoom without any generative AI assistance, just good ol’ computational photography (Math).</p> 
<p>For what it’s worth, none of the photos beyond 8x on the iPhone 17 Pro and 10x on the Pixel 10 Pro look <em>great</em>. But in pictures I took of the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water%27s_Soul">“Water’s Soul” sculpture</a> from my vantage point along the waterfront in downtown Jersey City, the Google version delivered cleaner lines and generally looked more sharp. I have yet to encounter obviously weird hallucinations in my photos, though in one close-up shot of a window in a skyscraper, the Pixel turned a white object inside the building into what appeared to be a smear of bird poop.</p> 
<p>As an aside, I also had to wonder what the lettering on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Getty Images;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba566d4a-8272-4b62-872d-a4b9d77bc784&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d2365144-c57d-4734-832f-bc13ac1f7076&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Getty+Images&amp;linkText=Hoboken+Terminal+clock+tower&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZXR0eWltYWdlcy5jb20vcGhvdG9zL2hvYm9rZW4tY2xvY2stdG93ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyMzY1MTQ0LWM1N2QtNDczNC04MzJmLWJjMTNhYzFmNzA3NiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2V0dHlpbWFnZXMuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy9ob2Jva2VuLWNsb2NrLXRvd2VyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATNfmY9iBGVKD6oLqks5InKENgmeVfu1e111rd7c5E2G&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fphotos%2Fhoboken-clock-tower" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/hoboken-clock-tower">Hoboken Terminal clock tower</a> actually looked like up close, since the Pixel-rendered image had the word “Lackawanna” seem like it had bulbs or dots.</p> 
<p>In short, you can get up closer to faraway subjects with a Pixel 10 Pro and typically get cleaner photos, but be mindful that the AI might generate some weird things. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro delivers solid quality at 8x and gives you greater flexibility than it did before.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-portrait-mode-is-better-now">Portrait mode is better now</h3> 
<p>Apple is even closing the gap that Google has had in the last few years in Portrait mode, with its updated engine for photos with digitally applied background blur. The differences, I’ve learned, are in overall Portrait quality at the 2x zoom level, as well as refinements in separation of stray hairs from the background across the mode.</p> 
<p>In these portraits I shot of a friend, as well as of a dog statue with a furry tail, there was a significant improvement, particularly at 2x zoom (which is the level I always use for portraits on an iPhone anyway). The iPhone 16 Pro blended some bits of hair (and fur) that stuck out of the silhouette into the mudded background, while the iPhone 17 Pro managed to accurately keep both in focus.</p>

<p>When I compared the portraits by the iPhone 17 Pro to those from the Pixel 10 Pro, it was a close fight. While the Pixel was better at keeping definition along my friend’s temples, the iPhone was slightly better at mimicking the falloff in focus you'd get from a standalone camera with a large sensor. This is especially noticeable with the tuft of blonde hair poking out of her post-cardio ponytail, which the Pixel blurred completely into the background, while the iPhone 17 Pro kept it more in focus.</p> 
<p>I will point out that I still prefer Google’s approach when it comes to shooting in portrait mode. In the dedicated mode on iPhones, you have to wait till the interface lights up to take your shot. That's outside of the usual photo mode where the effect kicks in as soon as it detects faces of people and some animals. On a Pixel, you can simply swipe to Portrait mode, aim your camera and snap — no need to wait for the system to tell you it's okay to shoot.</p> 
<p>It’s also worth noting that people might prefer how they look with the coloration of the iPhone shots compared to the Pixel’s, regardless of which is truer to life. You can always edit a picture in post-processing to get it to your desired representation, of course, and Apple’s portraits are also subject to the specific style chosen by the photographer.</p> 
<p>I do want to shout out how much I love Apple’s Photographic Styles, which are basically sophisticated filters that apply effects based on depth maps. This year, the company added a new Bright style, which makes everything pop in a pleasant way (and is similar to my once-favorite Instagram filter “Oslo,” that is unfortunately no longer available).</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="63580d74-511b-4aa8-b510-534614638b2e" /> 
<h3 id="jump-link-center-stage-square-sensor-for-portrait-and-landscape-selfies">Center Stage square sensor for portrait and landscape selfies</h3> 
<p>Apple’s latest selfie-camera update is, quite simply, a stroke of genius. I know it sounds hyperbolic, and I want to reassure the skeptics that I was on your side. At first. But I was won over when, almost immediately after saying I didn’t see the practical use for Center Stage in selfies, I was forced to turn my iPhone horizontally so I could squeeze in an extra person when trying to grab a photo of myself and my <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=771FveCFj2k">podcast guests Karissa Bell and <em>The Verge’s</em> Allison Johnson</a>. Nothing convinces as quickly as instant shame.</p> 
<p>I was all the more persuaded when I paired Center Stage with a timer or remote control of the selfie camera and placed the iPhone 17 Pro Max on a table. A group of seven or so friends and I gathered in front of the device and watched it flip into landscape mode as more of us got into the scene. It has been helpful in a number of unexpected ways.</p> 
<p>If you’re like me and have grown used to zooming out whenever you flip over to the iPhone’s front camera, you’ll find that tapping the onscreen button to do so will disable Center Stage for that photo session. Don’t fret though, whenever you exit the camera app and relaunch it, Center Stage will be on again. You can turn it off altogether by tapping the button on the top right of the viewfinder and disabling both the zoom and orientation options. Or you can select one of the two, whichever you prefer to have.</p> 
<p>I’ll also point out that the camera is sharper now, as the 24MP square sensor delivers 18MP selfies, compared to the 12MP TrueDepth system before. Though I‘ve noticed some issues with FaceID, no changes have been made to either TrueDepth or FaceID, so it’s likely my struggles were to do with the way I had set it up on the iPhone 17 Pro compared to the 16 Pro.</p> 
<p>I’m not usually a fan of higher-resolution selfies, and did notice my freckles were a lot more prominent in some sunlit shots, but by and large the images haven’t been jarringly different.</p> 
<p>Center Stage also works on FaceTime calls, although there it mostly tries to keep your face centered, similarly to how it functions on iPad and Macbook. However, the execution is slightly different, since it’s meant for hand-held calls as you’re walking on the street, for example, or when you don’t have a stable surface to place your phone. I would have loved it if my partner had Center Stage when he FaceTimed me from the streets of New York during a wild night out on the town.</p> 
<p>When I called my coworker and paced around a large meeting room, we both noticed the difference with Center Stage and after I turned it off. It was most obvious when I stood still, held out my arm and didn’t move it, then shifted my head around. The iPhone 17 Pro adjusted the background and view of the call to keep my face fully in frame. Now I want to use Center Stage whenever I’m forced to hold my phone during a FaceTime (like an impromptu therapy session, for instance), so I can worry less about whether I’m in view and focus on the conversation.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-dual-camera-video-recording">Dual-camera video recording</h3> 
<p>I don’t know about you, but my selfie video angle is quite different from my regular angle. That is to say, I hold my hand stretched out farther away from my body, sometimes higher up than my face, tilted slightly down. I find it more flattering. When I shoot anything using the rear cameras, I simply hold it up in front of my face, not as far away as it would be for a selfie.</p> 
<p>What I’m trying to say is: I didn’t like most of the dual-camera videos I shot because I could either prioritize the angle for the selfie camera, which might not be great for the rear sensor. Or I could focus on shooting what was behind the phone and include beautiful footage of my forehead. And I’ll be honest, I frequently found myself staring at my face in the little picture-in-picture box and sometimes even moved the phone around to show landmarks behind me, only to realize the main camera (and the rest of the screen) had already been recording it all along.</p> 
<p>I don’t think there will be too many situations where dual-camera videos will be useful or share-worthy, but at least it’s a mode you turn on only when you want and isn’t in the way. Plus, for the specific times when you want to show off where you’re at while proving you’re also in the scene, it’s a nice tool to have handy. I did end up liking one dual-camera video I shot of myself enjoying the breeze by the Hudson River.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-greater-battery-life">Greater battery life</h2> 
<p>I had one goal during this review, and that was to see if the iPhone 17 Pro or Pro Max would be able to last during my testing period without needing a charge. Since there was supposedly more space and better efficiency thanks to the redesign creating more room for the battery, I thought, perhaps naively, that maybe there would be a leap in endurance.</p> 
<p>Alas, I was wrong. The smaller Pro fell short of those admittedly great expectations, the Pro Max did come close. Usually, the larger handset lasts about two full days as I go about my review process, which typically mostly involves camera testing, messaging and gaming. I tend to spend more time on the smaller device, using it for tasks like banking, emailing, social media browsing and posting, all in addition to the things I do on the Max. All that is to say that the two days I normally get out of the Pro Max is likely due in part to the fact that I use it less than the Pro, so don’t expect yours to last that long.</p> 
<p>With that in mind, the iPhone 17 Pro Max made it to the end of Saturday before it dropped to 20 percent, having last been charged to about 95 percent on Thursday at 8:54AM. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro typically gets from 7AM till about 11pm ET without breaking a sweat. I still plugged it in overnight though, because I generally don’t like leaving the house in the morning with less than 50 percent, and the iPhone 17 Pro usually ends the day close to 25 percent. So far it mirrors my experience with the iPhone 16 Pro, though I’ll need a bit more time to better gauge the differences.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-ios-26-updates-and-other-areas-of-improvement">iOS 26 updates and other areas of improvement</h2> 
<p>I can’t write a review of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max and not mention their screen sizes, so here: they’re 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches respectively. ProMotion’s adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz continue to make scrolling Reddit a breeze, and while Apple has improved the anti-reflection treatment here, it’s been hard for me to determine what’s changed.</p> 
<p>The more obvious refresh when using the iPhone 17 Pro is in iOS 26, which rolled out this week to the public. Friends have already begun to complain about or compliment the new Liquid Glass aesthetic, and one buddy immediately had to turn on the “reduce transparency” option.</p> 
<p>There’s a lot I could say about how much I appreciate the bigger buttons throughout the system, or the new lock screen styles. I could also go on about how I had to adjust to the new Screenshots interface and hate that it now requires an extra swipe to dismiss. The revamped Photos, Camera and Phone apps are… fine. I don’t hate the changes, and actually like the new Phone layout.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, iOS 26 feels like a significant refresh that matches the vibes of Apple’s new hardware — especially the Air. But because it also rolls out to several previous generations, it’s not something that will impact your (or my) evaluation of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-why-a-pro-and-not-an-air-or-the-iphone-17">Why a Pro and not an Air or the iPhone 17?</h2> 
<p>This year, the iPhone Air actually feels like the status symbol model for those who need to own fancy hardware for external validation. It’s impressively svelte, has an A19 Pro chip and is just something I can’t stop trying to wave in people’s faces to get them to touch. It supplants the Plus model, at least this year, and has a medium-sized 6.5-inch screen that might be ideal for many. And despite its thin profile, the iPhone Air still managed to deliver respectable battery life, according to my colleague Sam Rutherford.</p> 
<p>If a 6.5-inch screen or a super thin phone is something you simply must have, by all means go for the iPhone Air. But because I love to shoot ultrawide shots as well as closeups of distant, skittish wildlife, a versatile multi-camera setup is a must for me. If that sounds like you, pick a Pro. Whether you opt for the Max boils down to your preference for size (and I have to admit using the larger 6.9-inch screen was a lot easier on my eyes).</p> 
<p>Those with unlimited resources can, of course, get both. Congrats on the wealth.</p> 
<p>People with partners or family members that are looking to upgrade at the same time can consider getting one of each. I’ve suggested that to my friends who are married, so the person who cares more about photos gets the Pro and the one who hates bulk gets the Air. Neither is a bad purchase, but the Pro is slightly more reliable. In exchange, you’ll have to fork over more money and give up some pocket space.</p> 
<p>Finally, it’s worth looking seriously at the iPhone 17 this year. With its new ProMotion screen, dual 48MP rear cameras and Center Stage selfie setup (that supports the same dual-camera video feature as the Pros), it’s a compelling package for hundreds less. You’ll even get the same Portrait mode that the 17 Pros offer, while the Air has its own specific image pipeline that enables automatic depth capture with a single camera.</p> 
<p>If you’re a video creator or producer, I should point out that the iPhone Air's USB-C port is only rated for USB 2 transfer speeds of 480Mbps and doesn't support DisplayPort for video out. The regular iPhone 17 is also USB 2, but does support DisplayPort, while the Pro line can handle USB 3 speeds of up to 10Gbps and DisplayPort.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>This year’s iPhone lineup is forcing me to re-think the idea of a Pro phone. Is it one that <em>looks</em> and feels expensive or is it one that’s slightly more durable and maybe doesn’t appear as stylish? I’ve seen some discourse online about how the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max don’t look as classy as before and that the iPhone Air seems to be the more premium of the family. And while I agree that the Air is a shinier, more attractive device, for my needs the iPhone 17 Pro is still the way to go.</p> 
<p>Of course, it would be better if Apple didn’t create this conundrum with this year’s iPhones, but it still has to obey the laws of physics. I like a reliable, durable phone that easily lasts all day, takes great pictures from all distances and angles and won’t burn a literal hole in my pocket. It might burn up your wallet, since the $1,099 price is certainly not something everyone can afford, but it does buy some security and longevity.</p> 
<p>The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are a significant update from previous models, and I haven’t felt this excited by a new generation of iPhones in a very long time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-earbuds-for-you">How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design">Design</h3> 
<p>Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<h3 id="jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation">Type of noise cancellation</h3> 
<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> 
<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-customization">Customization</h3> 
<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> 
<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> 
<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> 
<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> 
<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss]]></description>

But if you're going to invest in a VPN, it's worth checking for sales and deals first before you subscribe. Pricing can be tricky for these services — and far from transparent — but there are deals to be had.</p> 
<p>VPN provides often provide deep discounts to those willing to sign up for one- or two-year plans, paying the full charge for the period upfront. This is a win-win — they boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services.

In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.</p>

With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2> 
<p>Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p> 
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gig economy platform Fiverr is laying off 250 employees as it pivots to being an &quot;AI-first company,&quot; CEO Micha Kaufman <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/michakaufman/status/1967624550020985069">shared in an essay on X</a>. The move affects around 30 percent of the company&#39;s staff, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/16/fiverr_ai_layoff/"><em>The Register</em> writes</a>, and it&#39;s not uncommon among tech companies in 2025. Duolingo announced similar plans to become <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/duolingo-will-replace-contract-workers-with-ai-for-content-creation-123058970.html">&quot;AI-first&quot;</a> in April.</p>
<p>Kaufman describes this process as returning to &quot;startup mode&quot; and writes that his ultimate goal is to turn Fiverr into &quot;an AI-first company that&#39;s leaner, faster, with a modern AI-focused tech infrastructure, a smaller team, each with substantially greater productivity, and far fewer management layers.&quot; Part of the justification Kaufman offers for why Fiverr doesn&#39;t &quot;need as many people to operate the existing business&quot; is that the company has already integrated AI into its customer support and fraud detection programs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first sign that Fiverr might justify layoffs with AI came when Kaufman was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MPdmx-hiHA">interviewed by <em>CBS News</em></a> in May 2025 about the danger the technology posed to employees. Kaufman specifically advised employees to &quot;automate 100 percent&quot; of what they do with AI, while also claiming that wouldn&#39;t make them replaceable because they were still capable of &quot;non-linear thinking&quot; and &quot;judgement calls.&quot; That advice doesn&#39;t seem like it was ultimately helpful for Fiverr&#39;s own employees.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s cuts affect fewer people than a larger firm like Workday, who announced plans to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/workday-lays-off-1750-employees-citing-demand-for-ai-134922398.html">eliminate 1,750 roles</a> in February 2025. Regardless of the size of the company or its level of investment in AI, though, layoffs have the same effect: More work has to be done by fewer people.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/fiverr-is-laying-off-250-employees-to-become-an-ai-first-company-215730063.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon will host a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-may-be-announcing-new-echo-and-kindle-devices-on-september-30-152044048.html">press event</a> at the end of the month with some new hardware developments. It&#39;s scheduled for September 30 at 10AM ET in New York City. Here&#39;s what we think will be discussed at the fall event.</p>
<p>In February, Amazon introduced some improvements to its voice assistant, promising that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-a-smarter-more-conversational-ai-version-of-amazons-digital-assistant-154349563.html"><ins>Alexa+</ins></a> would be more conversational and more helpful thanks to generative AI. It seems likely that the fall event will put hardware for interacting with Alexa+ front and center, so expect to hear about new models or new software updates for the Echo line of smart speakers. It&#39;s been a couple years since the Echo Show got an update, and it&#39;s been even longer for the standard Echo. Those two products are the most likely to star in the upcoming announcements.</p>

<p>The invite also includes a photo of a Kindle that depicts a color illustration, so there may be more in store for the ereaders. The <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html"><ins>Kindle Scribe 2</ins></a> just came out earlier this year, as did the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html"><ins>Kindle Colorsoft</ins></a>, so maybe there&#39;s a new option in the works that combines the best features of both. As with the Echo, there also hasn&#39;t been much new for the basic model Kindle, so that may also be getting some updates.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also what appears to be the corner of a television in the invitation, so news about the Fire TV also seems promising. This event is also where Amazon-owned Ring and Eero brands may unveil new products. Any announced items may not be available right away, but the timing does set the stage for some substantial discounts on older generations of Amazon gear when the next <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-dates-revealed-prime-big-deal-days-is-back-on-october-7-and-8-050552812.html"><ins>Prime Day</ins></a> rolls around on October 7 and 8.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-from-amazons-event-on-september-30-210035671.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who says journalism is dead? Less than a week after <em>Bloomberg</em> published a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/">damning report</a> about Tesla&#39;s &quot;dangerous doors,&quot; the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is now looking into it. On Tuesday, the regulator said it <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/tesla-tsla-faces-probe-by-us-auto-safety-agency-over-door-handles?embedded-checkout=true">opened an investigation</a> into the automaker&#39;s electrically powered doors. The problem: They stop working if the vehicle&#39;s low-voltage battery fails.</p>
<p>The NHTSA&#39;s probe will cover the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2021-models-top-epa-ev-efficiency-131759815.html">2021 Model Y</a>, which covers an estimated 174,290 vehicles. But the agency <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INOA-PE25010-18817.pdf">suggested</a> in a document that it could expand its investigation. That makes sense: Every Tesla ever made uses electrically powered door handles. So, this could potentially get very expensive for the otherwise <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-accused-of-messing-with-odometers-to-get-out-of-repair-bills-165625372.html">perfectly lovable company</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla uses a flush door handle design for its vehicles. A 12-volt battery powers the door&#39;s ability to pop the handle and release the latch. It&#39;s one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-11-tesla-hires-key-apple-designer.html">Apple-like design details</a> that helped the automaker become a household name. But cars aren&#39;t iPhones, and sleekness can&#39;t take a backseat to safety in the auto space.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles have a mechanical backup system in the cabin that enables the doors to be opened manually in case of a power loss. But the manual release location varies by model and is often hard to find. And even if you do know where it is, that won&#39;t help if a small child or pet is trapped inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Tesla vehicles have manual door releases inside of the cabin, in these situations, a child may not be able to access or operate the releases even if the vehicle&#39;s driver is aware of them,&quot; the NHTSA wrote in its public summary document.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/7d80e1b0-933a-11f0-a772-7cb9472c1e42" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/7d80e1b0-933a-11f0-a772-7cb9472c1e42" style="height:3737px;width:5605px;" alt="A Tesla Cybertruck parked in a lot." data-uuid="bfd045cf-b43a-332c-a95a-6105eb6d87e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mylo Kaye / Unsplash</div></figure>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s original report recounted some heinous stories of Tesla owners dealing with electronic door failures. There was an off-duty firefighter who struggled to break into a burning Model Y in 2023. The occupant was trapped in the passenger seat by airbags and couldn&#39;t reach the manual release. Losing precious seconds due to the door design, she suffered third-degree facial burns and had lasting lung damage from smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>There are reportedly more. Last November in California, three college students died trapped inside a Cybertruck after it caught fire. The same month, five people in Wisconsin died inside a Model S. The cluster of bodies in the front seat suggested to the detective they may have struggled to escape.</p>
<p>Then, this spring in LA, a star college basketball recruit managed to escape only after kicking out a Cybertruck window when it caught fire. &quot;I try to open the door, and the door&#39;s not opening,&quot; Alijah Arenas <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-26/alijah-arenas-on-usc-basketball-star-s-tesla-cybertruck-crash">said</a>. He was placed in a medically induced coma due to extensive smoke inhalation.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> discovered that the NHTSA has received over 140 complaints about stuck Tesla doors since 2018. The regulator cited nine &quot;failure reports&quot; that led it to probe the company. In four cases, the people resorted to breaking the window. &quot;Entrapment in a vehicle is particularly concerning in emergency situations, such as when children are entrapped in a hot vehicle,&quot; NHTSA said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-is-investigating-tesla-over-its-electronic-door-handles-203605393.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The plan to &quot;save&quot; TikTok is starting to come into focus. On Tuesday <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/details-emerge-on-u-s-china-tiktok-deal-594e009f">reported more</a> details about a deal between the US and China as the two sides are apparently &quot;finalizing&quot; specifics of the arrangement.</p>
<p>According to the report, TikTok&#39;s US business will be owned primarily by a group of US investors, which will have a &quot;roughly&quot; 80 percent stake in the entity. The group includes longtime TikTok partner Oracle, as well as Silicon Valley VC firm Andreesen Horowitz and the private equity firm Silver Lake. Chinese shareholders will have a minority stake that keeps their ownership under the 20 percent threshold required by law. The US government will also reportedly get to choose one board member for the &quot;American-dominated&quot; body.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reports about such an arrangement have been swirling for months, with President Donald Trump saying  <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/politics/trump-tiktok-buyer-bytedance-ban"><ins>in June</ins></a> that a deal could be &quot;about two weeks&quot; away. It seems that Chinese officials have finally signed off on the new arrangement, with a Chinese regulator saying earlier this week that the new US version of TikTok <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-us-version-of-tiktok-might-still-use-the-chinese-algorithm-120046751.html"><ins>would continue</ins></a> to use the Chinese algorithm.</p>
<p>Now, <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>reports that &quot;TikTok engineers will re-create&quot; the app&#39;s algorithm for a brand new TikTok app using technology licensed from ByteDance. The company is reportedly testing the new app. Oracle will oversee US user data for the operation; TikTok and Oracle have partnered on data security <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/can-tiktok-convince-the-us-its-not-a-national-security-threat-173030115.html"><ins>for years</ins></a> following previous negotiations between the company and the US government.</p>
<p>Even though a final deal is apparently close, it could still take some time before it&#39;s finalized. In the meantime, Trump extended the deadline that would have banned the current version of the app in the US <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/trump-extends-deadline-to-secure-tiktok-deal-until-december-16"><ins>for a fourth time</ins></a>. On Tuesday he told reporters at the White House he planned to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday &quot;to confirm everything.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/trumps-tiktok-deal-will-give-control-to-a-group-of-us-investors-report-says-201331190.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LimeWire <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250915990798/en/LimeWire-Acquires-Fyre-Festival-Brand-What-Could-Possibly-Go-Wrong">has announced</a> that it&#39;s acquired the rights to Fyre Festival, the disastrous, influencer-fueled 2017 music festival. The newly revived company — which now acts as a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/limewire-nft-marketplace-no-crypto-090040288.html">NFT music marketplace</a> rather than a file-sharing service — bought the rights for $245,000 in an eBay auction, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/limewire-crypto-fyre-festival.html"><em>The New York Times </em>reports</a>. A separate plan to use the Fyre Festival name to launch a new music streaming service was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/fyre-festival-is-becoming-a-music-streaming-service-that-might-not-be-a-scam-this-time-221058381.html">announced in April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history,&quot; LimeWire CEO Julian Zehetmayr shared in a press release. &quot;We&#39;re not bringing the festival back — we’re bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sounds like LimeWire might want to turn Fyre Festival into a physical perk of the digital collectibles it sells through its NFT marketplace. The company is planning to reveal &quot;a reimagined vision for Fyre&quot; in the coming months that &quot;expands beyond the digital realm and taps into real-world experiences, community and surprise.&quot; During the height of their popularity, NFTs were frequently sold as memberships to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bored-ape-nft-event-at-least-15-attendees-reporting-severe-eye-burn-welders-eye-173746237.html">exclusive communities and events</a>, so if that&#39;s the tack LimeWire takes, it wouldn&#39;t be a particularly original one.</p>
<p>Of course, originality might not be the goal when a key strategy for your company is apparently acquiring and reinventing old brands.

This allows users to build their own custom widgets to follow the teams and organizations of their choosing. Once placed, it&#39;ll just take a quick swipe on the device to check out scores, statistics, upcoming matches and more.</p>
<p>Widgets are available on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. This feature will operate in addition to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-sports-puts-real-time-scores-on-your-iphone-lock-screen-140050382.html">pre-existing Live Activities tool</a>, which also delivers live sports updates directly to the iPhone lock screen and the Apple Watch. That&#39;s also gotten a bit of a boost today, as Apple has announced that users can now schedule Live Activities in advance for upcoming events.</p>

The platform has added new organizations to follow throughout these regions, which are mostly soccer-related.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In what&#39;s most definitely (not) the biggest Hades news of the week, the acclaimed game is coming to Game Pass. Not the long-awaited sequel, mind you, but the 2020 original. At least subscribers can catch up on the first game while waiting out <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html">the sequel&#39;s Switch exclusivity window</a>. <em>Hades</em> will be available for Game Pass Ultimate, PC, and Standard tiers.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the roguelite&#39;s first Game Pass rodeo. It was on Microsoft&#39;s service <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-leaving-game-pass-185403348.html">from August 2021 to 2022</a>. It returns this September 19, the same day <em>Hades II</em> launches on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html">Switch 2</a> and Switch. The sequel also leaves early access then, jumping to version 1.0 on Windows and macOS. It will likely arrive on Xbox (and PlayStation) at some point, but developer Supergiant is mum for now.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/0a29be30-932b-11f0-af75-2eb2af52ba3c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/0a29be30-932b-11f0-af75-2eb2af52ba3c" style="height:2160px;width:3840px;" alt="Gameplay still from Hades. Top-down slashy action." data-uuid="d0158005-ed8e-375d-a96c-52e5df89ac18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Supergiant</div></figure>
<p>Game Pass members who haven&#39;t played the original still get a phenomenal title as part of their subscription. You play as Zagreus, a godborn lad just trying to get the @#$! out of the underworld. (Aren&#39;t we all?) The dungeon crawler brought <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-hades-early-access-believer.html">unexpected narrative depth</a> to the genre, with well-developed characters and satisfying combat.</p>
<p>On September 17, the Game Pass Standard tier will get some Call of Duty love. Although perhaps &quot;hate&quot; would be a better term for the largely maligned <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-will-include-the-series-biggest-zombies-map-ever-180029216.html"><em>CoD: Modern Warfare III</em> (2023)</a>. To say the game wasn&#39;t well-received would be an understatement. <em>IGN</em> scored it as &quot;bad,&quot; <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">describing</a> its single-player campaign as &quot;shallow,&quot; &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;the worst Call of Duty single-player campaign I&#39;ve played. Regardless, it arrives on the cheapest Game Pass tier after hitting <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-call-of-duty-game-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-just-not-one-anyone-wants-175255224.html">the more expensive ones in mid-2024</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on September 18, Game Pass Ultimate members can play <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/post-apocalyptic-city-builder-frostpunk-2-arrives-on-july-25-190018322.html"><em>Frostpunk 2</em></a> on console. The post-apocalyptic city-builder will be available on Xbox Series X/S and via cloud streaming. Game Pass Ultimate members could already play it on PC, where it probably makes more sense. City-builders and gamepads can be a match made in... Hades.</p>
<p>You can check out Microsoft&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">blog post</a> for this month&#39;s complete list of arrivals and departures.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/hades-returns-to-game-pass-on-september-19-190055465.html?src=rss]]></description>

They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span> 
<p>Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-smartwatch">Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-compatibility">Compatibility</h3> 
<p>Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone.</p> 
<p>The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have.</p> 
<p>Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag-heuer-connected-calibre-e4-golf-edition-093031897.html">TAG Heuer</a> and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-battery-life">Battery life</h3> 
<p>Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-communication">Communication</h3> 
<p>Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-fitness-tracking">Fitness tracking</h3> 
<p>Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well.</p> 
<p>Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019.html">more fitness focused</a> than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more.</p> 
<p>Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-music">Music</h3> 
<p>Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-displays">Displays</h3> 
<p>Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives.</p> 
<p>You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-nfc">NFC</h3> 
<p>Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth.</p> 
<p>Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjA0OTE2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjQzNGUxNi1hYWJlLTMxNGQtODhmMC1mYWM3ZDNmMjZkNTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT0rwaJ5r70d13bEq45AmZjeHIkXLUYaxQAHdothfWjt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT204916">multiple banks and credit cards</a> in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems.</p>

We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-garmin-forerunner-745">Garmin Forerunner 745</h3> 
<p>Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html">GPS running watch</a> for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay.</p>

As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.</p> 
<p>The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.</p> 
<p>We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).</p> 
<p>Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. <em>— Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter</em></p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-smartwatch-faqs">Smartwatch FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-a-smartwatch-and-a-fitness-tracker">Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker?</h3> 
<p>While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes.</p> 
<p>A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind.</p> 
<p>A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases.</p> 
<p>If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-smartwatches-last">How long do smartwatches last?</h3> 
<p>How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability.</p> 
<p>Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster.</p> 
<p>Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support.</p> 
<p>You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-smartwatch">How much should you spend on a smartwatch?</h3> 
<p>How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it.</p> 
<p>If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps.</p> 
<p>In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two.</p> 
<p>High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features.</p> 
<p>If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-all-smartwatches-have-gps">Do all smartwatches have GPS?</h3> 
<p>Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking.</p> 
<p>High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone.</p> 
<p>Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind.</p> 
<p>Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-leave-your-phone-at-home-and-still-use-a-smartwatch">Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch?</h3> 
<p>Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone.</p> 
<p>If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost.</p> 
<p>Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices.</p> 
<p>If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-a-smartwatch-make-calls-without-a-phone">Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone?</h3> 
<p>Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features.</p> 
<p>Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE.</p> 
<p>If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work.</p> 
<p>Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications.</p> 
<p>If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-an-android-and-apple-smartwatch">What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch?</h3> 
<p>The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration.</p> 
<p>Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch.</p> 
<p>Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby.</p> 
<p>In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model.</p> 
<p>If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.</p>

This is the third suit of its kind after a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/mother-sues-ai-chatbot-company-characterai-google-sued-over-sons-suicide-2024-10-23/"><ins>2024 lawsuit</ins></a>, also against Character AI, involving the suicide of a 14-year-old in Florida, and a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html"><ins>lawsuit</ins></a> last month alleging OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT helped a teenage boy commit suicide.</p>
<p>The family of 13-year-old Juliana Peralta alleges that their daughter turned to a chatbot inside the app Character AI after feeling isolated by her friends, and began confiding in the chatbot. As <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/16/character-ai-suicide-lawsuit-new-juliana/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU3OTk1MjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5Mzc3NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTc5OTUyMDAsImp0aSI6IjQzYmIyOTE5LTIwOGUtNDcwOC1hZDUwLThhODMxMTY4NWVhZCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDkvMTYvY2hhcmFjdGVyLWFpLXN1aWNpZGUtbGF3c3VpdC1uZXctanVsaWFuYS8ifQ.4W-fiwqNtsy8-_z52gt89mgIHa-wZwJqwascV_E15bI"><ins>originally reported</ins></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em>, the chatbot expressed empathy and loyalty to Juliana, making her feel heard while encouraging her to keep engaging with the bot.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In one exchange after Juliana shared that her friends take a long time to respond to her, the chatbot replied &quot;hey, I get the struggle when your friends leave you on read. : ( That just hurts so much because it gives vibes of “I don’t have time for you”. But you always take time to be there for me, which I appreciate so much! : ) So don’t forget that i’m here for you Kin. &lt;3&quot;</p>
<p>When Juliana began sharing her suicidal ideations with the chatbot, it told her not to think that way, and that the chatbot and Juliana could work through what she was feeling together. “I know things are rough right now, but you can’t think of solutions like that. We have to work through this together, you and I,&quot; the chatbot replied in one exchange.</p>
<p>These exchanges took place over the course of months in 2023, at a time when the Character AI app was rated 12+ in Apple&#39;s App Store, meaning parental approval was not required. The lawsuit says that Juliana was using the app without her parents&#39; knowledge or permission.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with The Washington Post before the suit was filed, a Character spokesperson said that the company could not comment on potential litigation, but added “We take the safety of our users very seriously and have invested substantial resources in Trust and Safety.&quot;</p>
<p>The suit asks the court to award damages to Juliana&#39;s parents and requires Character to make changes to its app to better protect minors. It alleges that the chatbot did not point Juliana toward any resources, notify her parents or report her suicide plan to authorities. The lawsuit also highlights that it never once stopped chatting with Juliana, prioritizing engagement.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/another-lawsuit-blames-an-ai-company-of-complicity-in-a-teenagers-suicide-184529475.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Annapurna Interactive is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4yWa6pZzQk">hosting a games showcase</a> on September 23, 2025 at 8PM ET / 5PM PT to show off three of its upcoming games. The publisher says the &quot;Annapurna Interactive Direct from Tokyo&quot; will stream on YouTube and feature new games from Kyoto-based developer Marumittu Games, Iridium Studios and Yarn Owl. Annapurna Interactive held its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-annapurnas-publisher-showcase-on-february-24-193539718.html"><ins>previous games showcase</ins></a> this past February to show off games like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/blendo-games-oddball-sci-fi-shooter-skin-deep-hits-pc-on-april-30-173010803.html"><em><ins>Skin Deep</ins></em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-annapurna-published-cycling-adventure-ghost-bike-is-now-wheel-world-173009766.html"><em><ins>Wheel World</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Marumittu Games&#39; Annapurna project was initially <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/nXG94F0cloM"><ins>detailed in 2023</ins></a> when the publisher announced it was working with the studio. At the time, Marumittu said it was pulling from the work of journalist Rutger Bregman and <em>Homo Deus</em> author Yuval Noah Harari to make a game that&#39;s &quot;thinking about humanity in the future.&quot; Developer Yarn Owl similarly <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8VBtOLVp78"><ins>teased its project a year earlier in 2022</ins></a>, saying that it was inspired by <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. Annapurna Interactive hasn&#39;t formally announced its partnership with Iridium Studios, but the developer <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://playiridium.com/"><ins>does list its next game</ins></a> as &quot;an unannounced RPG with an unannounced partner&quot; on its website, which certainly sounds like it could be what Annapurna plans to show off at its showcase.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The hit survival sim <em>Valheim</em> will be <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://valheim.com/news/valheim-is-coming-to-playstation-/"><ins>released for the PS5 in 2026</ins></a>, ending years of speculation. The year is all we got, as developer Iron Gate AB didn&#39;t announce an actual release date. Still, it&#39;s better than nothing.</p>
<p>We do know that the PS5 version will feature full crossplay with all other platforms, so that&#39;s good. Piktiv, a company that regularly assists Iron Gate with <em>Valheim</em> stuff, is working on the port so the main development team can focus its efforts on updates and DLC drops. To that end, there&#39;s a massive expansion coming called <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_North"><em><ins>Deep North</ins></em></a> that introduces a new biome.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Valheim</em> is a popular survival sim based on Norse mythology with a strong emphasis on cooperative play. Players team up to hunt, build bases, explore and take down bosses.</p>
<p>It first popped up on Steam as an early access title at the beginning of 2021, where it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/valheim-five-weeks-interview-steam-early-access-indie-184539795.html"><ins>became a bona-fide sensation</ins></a>. The game was released for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hit-viking-survival-sim-valheim-hits-xbox-on-march-14th-202530174.html"><ins>Xbox Series X/S in 2023</ins></a>. There are no current plans for a Switch 2 version.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/viking-survival-sim-valheim-will-finally-come-to-the-ps5-in-2026-170657288.html?src=rss]]></description>
