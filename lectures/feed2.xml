                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta has successfully avoided what was once the biggest existential threats to its company. A federal judge has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/meta-wins-ftc-antitrust-trial-over-instagram-whatsapp-deals" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">sided</a> with the social media company in a landmark antitrust case, ruling on Tuesday that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had not proven that Meta is a monopoly. </p><p>The FTC filed antitrust charges against Meta, then known as Facebook, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-antitrust-ftc-48-states-194858668.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in 2020</a> during President Donald Trump&#39;s first term. The government had argued that by acquiring its one-time rivals, Instagram and WhatsApp, the company had hurt US consumers by stifling competition in the social media industry. Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/ftcs-weak-case-against-meta-ignores-reality/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">had argued</a> that those services were only able to grow to the 1 billion-user apps because of its investment and had cited the rise of TikTok as proof that it continues to face strong competition.</p><p>On Tuesday, US District judge James Boasberg ruled in favor <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rww8JGP.20cc/v0" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">of Meta</a>. &quot;Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.&quot;</p><p>If the FTC had succeeded, it could have called for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. The FTC could still appeal the ruling, though it’s not clear ifit has plans to do so. We’ve reached out to the agency for comment.</p><p>&quot;The Court&#39;s decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.&quot;</p><p>A number of current and former high-profile executives, including Adam Mosseri, Sheryl Sandberg, Kevin Systrom and Mark Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-weve-learned-from-ftc-v-meta-antitrust-trial-162048138.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">testified</a> during the weeks-long trial earlier this year. In his testimony, Zuckerberg spoke about the immense pressure Meta felt from TikTok, saying that Meta&#39;s growth had &quot;slowed down dramatically&quot; as TikTok became more popular.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out that Meta&#39;s defense that TikTok and YouTube are major competitors to it helped sway Judge Boasberg. While the FTC&#39;s lawyers had tried to claim that Meta had a monopoly on &quot;personal social networking&quot; apps — a narrow group it said included Snapchat and the decentralized app MeWe — Boasberg was unable to ignore the dominance of TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>&quot;PSN [personal social networking] apps may have been a market unto themselves when the FTC filed this case in 2020 or when it approved Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014,&quot; he wrote. &quot;That is no longer the case. The Court ultimately finds that YouTube and TikTok belong in the product market, and they prevent Meta from holding a monopoly.&nbsp; Even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC’s case.&quot;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-won-the-antitrust-case-that-could-have-forced-it-to-spin-off-instagram-and-whatsapp-184320742.html?src=rss]]></description>

Autonomous vehicles in Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando will begin accepting rides next year.</p><p>The Alphabet-owned company said operations (sans passengers) will begin on Tuesday in Miami. The other cities will follow &quot;over the coming weeks.&quot; This phase is where the vehicles drive around town without anyone inside. That gives the company a chance to spot local quirks and adjust the driving algorithm accordingly.</p><p>Waymo said this local adjustment phase requires fewer changes with each added city. &quot;This data feeds into a flywheel of continuous improvement, bolstered by rigorous validation through real-world driving and advanced simulation, then implemented through regular software releases,&quot; it wrote. The company claims its robotaxis are involved in 11 times fewer serious injury accidents than human drivers.</p><p>Waymo&#39;s autonomous vehicles currently accept passengers in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://waymo.com" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">list</a> of &quot;up next&quot; cities is much longer, including a recently announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-launching-in-three-new-cities-next-year-182515034.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">expansion into San Diego, Detroit and Las Vegas</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-coming-to-five-more-cities-190000992.html?src=rss]]></description>

This means that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><ins>development will continue</ins></a> just months after <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-and-ends-development-of-hytale-190435047.html"><ins>Riot shut everything down</ins></a> and cancelled the project.</p>
<p>The developer is also rehiring 30 staffers that were laid off as part of the cancellation. We write so often about <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eleven-percent-of-game-developers-were-laid-off-in-2024-according-to-gdc-survey-130003228.html"><ins>layoffs in the industry</ins></a>, so it&#39;s always a distinct treat to cover the opposite.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6ebbd9a18f6a4bd18096d7e800959a7d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We did it. Hytale is saved.

<p>Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme calls this a &quot;new and exciting chapter&quot; for the game, which has been in development for nearly ten years. He says he is &quot;grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Riot Games, which is owned by the conglomerate Tencent, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-buys-hypixel-studios-hytale-171845047.html"><ins>purchased Hypixel Studios back in 2020</ins></a> for an undisclosed sum. However, <em>Hytale</em> was riding high at that point. The game had attracted over 2.5 million signees for an upcoming beta and was supposed to be officially released in 2021.</p>
<p>Years passed, and still no <em>Hytale</em>. This eventually led to Riot canning the project entirely. &quot;After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale</em> to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale"><ins>an official post</ins></a> on the Hypixel website once read.</p>

<p>The studio hasn&#39;t disclosed how it got funding for this move, but Collins-Laflamme said that the founders are &quot;personally committed to funding for the next 10 years.&quot; Here&#39;s to hoping the game is actually playable by that point. To that end, the company does plan on announcing an early access release date in the near future.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hytale</em> has had a long and challenging journey. It&#39;s taken longer than anyone hoped, and it&#39;s changed a lot along the way,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;This is not going to be easy. This is not going to be fast. This is not going to be perfect. But it&#39;s going to be ours. Built together: one feature at a time, one bug fix at a time, one mod at a time.&quot;</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Hytale</em> is a nifty-looking adventure game that can be described as an open world riff on <em>Minecraft</em>. It certainly looks like <em>Minecraft</em>, but it has a much bigger emphasis on action and RPG mechanics.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-buys-its-ip-from-riot-so-hytale-is-back-in-development-185040959.html?src=rss]]></description>

Meanwhile, NVIDIA has pledged up to $5 billion in the Claude maker. The three-way partnership, which includes various other commitments, could be seen as further evidence that an AI bubble is about to burst.</p><p>As part of the deal, Anthropic has committed to buy $30 billion of Microsoft Azure cloud computing capacity. Anthropic says it will also contract additional capacity, up to one gigawatt. In addition, Microsoft Foundry customers will gain access to several Claud models. These include <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/claude-sonnet-45-is-anthropics-safest-ai-model-yet-170000161.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1</a> and Haiku 4.5.</p><p>Meanwhile, NVIDIA and Anthropic will work together to improve Anthropic&#39;s AI models for NVIDIA hardware.

It didn’t take long to see the apparent fruit of that.

To borrow imagery from the &quot;two Spider-Men&quot; meme, the AI world increasingly looks like a big circle of web-slingers, all pointing at each other. Only in this case, each index finger is flinging billions of dollars to help prop up the other Spider-Men. (Pay no mind to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">AI layoffs</a>.)

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat has introduced a new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-topic-chats">feature</a> called “Topic Chats,” which allows users of the social network to participate in public conversations about popular trends. By its own admission, Snapchat has previously focused on private conversations, but says the growth of its TikTok-like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-q4-2020-earnings-220645065.html">Spotlight</a> feature made it clear that people want to comment publicly about topics they’re interested in.</p>
<p>Topic Chats, which are coming to Canada, New Zealand and the US first, will appear in different areas of the Snapchat app in the shape of a big yellow button that says &quot;Join the Chat.&quot; Tap it and you’ll join that conversation, where you can also browse related Spotlight videos. The company used F1 and the reality show <em>Below Deck </em>as examples of topics that could feature.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snapchat will show you when your friends are in a particular chat, and any that you join will then appear at the top of your personalized Topic Chat page. Snap says it will moderate the new platform to ensure it remains safe, and told <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/snapchat-rolls-out-topic-chats-for-public-conversations/#:~:text=After%20primarily%20focusing%20on%20private,TV%20show%20%E2%80%9CBelow%20Deck.%E2%80%9D"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that it will use LLMs, among other measures, to ensure that topics being engaged with are of an appropriate nature. All profiles will remain private unless you’re already friends, which Snap says will prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages.</p>
<p>Topic Chats are set to go live in the coming weeks, and will appear in Chat shortcuts and the Stories page, as well as when searching or viewing Spotlight videos.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchats-new-topic-chats-feature-makes-it-easier-to-comment-publicly-on-things-youre-interested-in-171111409.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-power-banks">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Power banks</h2> 
<p>Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and let you play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to the wall. Anker power banks are among the best. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than most brands out there.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-wireless-chargers">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Wireless chargers</h2> 
<p>A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the slickest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our<a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html"> wireless charger guide</a> and our list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html">best multi-device chargers</a>.

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-power-adapters">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Power adapters</h2> 
<p>While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html">guide to the best fast chargers</a> and we recommend the brand in a number of our <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html">accessories</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-macbook-accessories-150014737.html">guides</a>. Now that Black Friday is here, some of our favorite Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-black-friday-anker-deals-soundcore-audio">Best Black Friday Anker deals: Soundcore audio</h2> 
<p>We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our<a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html"> guide to the best Bluetooth speakers</a>. With Black Friday deals, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4 is now discounted to $750 for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>. The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html">our review</a>, now for less.</p> 
<p>The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="3f7bcc453bef41d08a2f2f11cd9c2121" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks.</p> 
<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support.</p> 
<p>Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger.</p> 
<p>There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price.</p>

That’s not the case with Seergrills though, as the company has started shipping its AI-powered <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-perfecta-grill-uses-ai-to-help-cook-a-steak-in-90-seconds-041030578.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Perfecta grills</a> to early adopters after introducing the machine at CES 2024.</p>
<p>The Perfecta relies on AI-powered cooking tech that helps you create “chef-quality results” in a fraction of the time as traditional grilling. It’s powered by a quad-core processor and an arsenal of sensors which allow it to detect food thickness, temperature and doneness. All you have to do is select the food and desired sear and doneness levels via the built-in touchscreen or the Seergrills app. </p>
<p>The Perfecta utilizes a vertical cooking system where food is held by so-called VertiGrates. Dual infrared burners move closer to foods as needed during the cooking process and can achieve a maximum temperature of 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit — hot enough to cook a steak in 90 seconds. Seergrills says the Perfecta can hit those temps in under two minutes, drastically reducing preheating times. This setup also means that there’s no flipping required. The company says the configuration will consistently provide the perfect sear, doneness and moisture retention. Over time, the Perfecta learns from your culinary exploits, refining various cooking profiles to become more precise with each grilling session.</p>

<p>And it’s not just a grill either. The Perfecta has oven, pizza and rotisserie modes — if you splurge for the requisite accessories — and a manual mode (called Human Mode) for AI-free operation. What’s more, you can build and save your own cooking profiles for future use. </p>
<p>Despite the oven look, the Perfecta is very much an outdoor grill. It runs on 120-volt electricity and propane gas in order to power the electronics and those high-heat burners. The grill is built with aerospace-grade aluminum, marine-grade stainless steel and both ceramic and tempered glass. The cooking grates are made of naturally non-stick stainless steel and internal components also use stainless steel for easy cleaning. Lastly, the drip tray and grease management system are dishwasher safe. </p>
<p>If you were waiting until the company starting shipping units before committing to one, you’re going to have to wait even longer. Seergrills is now taking orders for its fifth wave of shipments, but those aren’t scheduled to go out until May 2026. You’re also going to pay a lot more for it. Back in 2024, the price tag on the Perfecta was set at $3,500, but now that has gone up to $5,999. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool you can use to protect your identity online, change your virtual location, evade censorship, check out foreign streaming services and more. They mostly take the form of commercially available subscription apps, often so simple to operate that all you need to do is press a button to turn them on and off.</p>
<p>While using a VPN is easy in practice, there&#39;s a lot going on under the hood. Knowing what&#39;s really happening can help you decide which VPN is right for you, then use it more effectively once you&#39;ve got it. In this guide, I&#39;m going to delve into what a VPN really is, how it works and what you might need one for.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If this article convinces you that you need a VPN — and I hope it does! — I curate a collection of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-expressvpn-surfshark-and-more-120056432.html">the best VPN deals</a> that I update at least once a week. Head over there to get your VPN shopping started.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn"><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></h2>
<p>The name &quot;virtual private network&quot; comes from the initial use of the technology to access restricted networks from off-site — if you work remotely, you probably still use a VPN this way. Those are corporate VPNs, though, from providers like Cisco. Here, we&#39;re talking about commercial VPNs sold for individual use.</p>
<p>These services came about when people realized that if you connected to the public internet through a VPN, every server you contacted would see the VPN server instead of your personal computer. The VPN effectively becomes a mask that interacts with the web on your behalf. That&#39;s the simple principle underlying every commercial VPN you&#39;ve seen advertised.</p>

<p>VPNs like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">ExpressVPN</a> operate servers in various locations around the world. When you use their apps, you&#39;ve got access to all the servers in their network. After you connect, communications between your device and your chosen server are encrypted so nobody can trace your activities back to you. This is called tunneling, and is the main difference between a full VPN and a simple proxy server.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-does-a-vpn-work"><strong>How does a VPN work?</strong></h2>
<p>Questions like the above can get into the weeds fast, so I&#39;ll be oversimplifying here. VPNs handle encryption in two steps. First, they establish a secure tunnel to your computer or phone, then they send information through it.</p>
<p>The first step — establishing the connection — is called a handshake. It uses asymmetric encryption, where each party has a public and a private key. In a handshake, two parties use public keys to confirm that they are who they say they are, then exchange the keys they&#39;ll use for simpler symmetric encryption.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/84c5c620-4876-11f0-bf6f-eac7d01cf714" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/84c5c620-4876-11f0-bf6f-eac7d01cf714" style="height:1895px;width:3414px;" alt="NordVPN leak test" data-uuid="084ecc21-658e-3bba-8305-2be04f89936f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Once the handshake has confirmed the path between your device and the VPN server, the tunnel is complete. From then on until you disconnect, every packet of data you send will be encrypted before it leaves your device and not decrypted until it reaches the VPN. The same is true in the other direction. Website requests and other data sent between the VPN and your internet service provider (ISP) will not be encrypted, but that&#39;s OK — without the information on the first step, it&#39;s impossible to identify you behind the VPN.</p>
<p>This is a complicated process, but VPNs use sets of instructions called VPN protocols to run through it near-instantly. A VPN protocol covers encryption and transit using several sets of ciphers. The most common protocols these days are OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2/IPSec, though many VPN services have their own proprietary protocols as selling points.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-vpn"><strong>What are the benefits of using a VPN?</strong></h2>
<p>Although the above process happens mostly in the background, it does tax your internet connection a little. The best VPNs keep impacts to a minimum, but you may notice a drop in speed, plus higher latencies when connecting to servers far away. So, what benefits do you get in exchange for all that?</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-anonymity"><strong>Anonymity</strong></h3>
<p>The first and biggest boon is near-total anonymity. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) put out <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/look-what-isps-know-about-you-examining-privacy-practices-six-major-internet-service-providers">a comprehensive report</a> on everything your ISP knows about you — confirming that nearly every ISP gets a second profit stream from selling information on your online activities. In essence, they&#39;re making you pay them for the right to hose your own privacy. But a VPN lets you strike back.</p>
<p>Since you connect to the VPN server before your ISP ever clocks you (let alone your destination websites), your computer and modem broadcast no information about who you really are. Anyone can see what you&#39;re doing, but they&#39;ll only see the VPN server doing it. And hiding your IP address is vital — lots of people (not just ISPs) can deduce a shocking amount about you with no other information, including your real location.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-prevent-isp-speed-throttling"><strong>Prevent ISP speed throttling</strong></h3>
<p>Speed isn&#39;t normally one of the benefits of a VPN, but in some specific cases, you might get faster internet. ISPs occasionally throttle the speeds of certain users they perceive as using too much bandwidth. This can happen to you, whether or not the charge is accurate. Using a VPN can get around the slowdown, since the ISP can&#39;t identify you to throttle you. Just note you still can&#39;t go faster than your unprotected internet speed.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-public-wifi-safety"><strong>Public Wi-Fi safety</strong></h3>
<p>A VPN can also keep you safe when using public Wi-Fi. On an unsecured Wi-Fi network — the sort you often find in cafes, hotel lobbies and other public buildings — hackers can spy on you through various vulnerabilities, or even set up fake networks (called &quot;rogue hotspots&quot;) to capture your information. If your connection with the network is encrypted, the criminal&#39;s window of opportunity slams shut.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-get-around-content-blocks-and-firewalls"><strong>Get around content blocks and firewalls</strong></h3>
<p>The other most important thing a VPN can do is to change your virtual location. IP addresses are keyed to specific locations — some to countries or regions, and some to networks as small as one building. Authorities can use this to restrict internet access on the networks they control. This can vary in scale, from your school or workplace blocking certain content, all the way up to the nation-level firewalls in China, Saudi Arabia and other countries.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that your internet goes to the VPN before it goes anywhere<em>&nbsp;</em>else. If your school&#39;s internet blocks some sites, you could get on a VPN server and the school&#39;s firewall won&#39;t know you&#39;re connecting from inside. This even works with countries (though not always). By connecting to a server outside the sphere of oppression, you can organize activism online even when the government doesn&#39;t want you to.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/4d365ff0-67eb-11f0-adcd-a612ad3beeae" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/4d365ff0-67eb-11f0-adcd-a612ad3beeae" style="height:1623px;width:3281px;" alt="Surfshark Netflix test" data-uuid="b23557ad-c7d4-348a-816f-51e262e1cd9a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Of course, you can also use this trick for fun by checking out other countries&#39; streaming libraries, viewing local exclusive events or protecting you while you download a torrent file. The key takeaway is that VPNs are versatile, and can be used for casual entertainment, life-and-death anonymity or both at once.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-will-a-vpn-keep-me-completely-safe-online"><strong>Will a VPN keep me completely safe online?</strong></h2>
<p>VPNs are a huge positive for individual privacy rights, but just having one doesn&#39;t mean you can ignore your online safety. It&#39;s better to think of VPNs as <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html">one part of a comprehensive strategy</a>.</p>
<p>A VPN keeps you anonymous, prevents you from being tracked and changes your location to bypass censorship. However, it can&#39;t directly protect you from downloading malware, falling for a phishing scam, oversharing information on social media, using an easily guessed password or getting your phone stolen in real life.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one key difference between threats a VPN can prevent and those it can&#39;t: A VPN only protects you from being spied on <em>without your consent. </em>If all you&#39;re doing is browsing on a network, a VPN keeps you concealed. But today&#39;s malefactors have all sorts of tricks to get you to give your consent. Websites spam message windows until you click &quot;allow cookies.&quot; Hackers send phishing emails and make you click links that download malware. And so on.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-can-vpns-be-trusted"><strong>Can VPNs be trusted?</strong></h2>
<p>There&#39;s also one other critical point. Even if a VPN keeps you completely anonymous, the VPN itself can still tie your identity to what you do online. That&#39;s why VPNs all claim to have &quot;strict no-logging policies&quot; or something similar — they&#39;re promising not to abuse their access.</p>
<p>Naturally, some do anyway. A VPN can be sued if it breaks its own privacy policy, but many escape liability by leaving just enough leeway that they technically aren&#39;t in violation. The best way to determine if you can trust a VPN is to look at its history. How long has it been operating? Has it ever mishandled or profited off customer data in that time? On the other hand, has it ever been raided by police who then found nothing, bolstering its claim to not keep logs?</p>

<p>Some of the most trustworthy VPNs take technical steps to guarantee that they aren&#39;t logging user activity. Many use RAM-only or diskless servers that automatically delete any logs. <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">Proton VPN</a> goes even farther, using full-disk encryption to render any logs unreadable (even if they did exist). These services back their claims up with independent audits from reliable firms.</p>
<p>Bottom line: A VPN is no substitute for common sense, threat awareness and a suite of strong security tools. It&#39;ll work best alongside a password manager, virus scanner and two-factor authentication.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-are-vpns-legal"><strong>Are VPNs legal?</strong></h2>
<p>VPNs are legal in every free country on Earth. While the UK recently suggested that a VPN ban was <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2127999/vpn-ban-on-table-online">&quot;on the table&quot;</a> to enforce its age verification laws, and the US states of <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/wisconsin-wants-to-force-all-adult-sites-to-block-vpns-with-a-new-age-verification-bill-heres-everything-we-know">Wisconsin</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/04/proposed-vpn-ban-michigan-tech-watchdog/86463820007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=false&amp;gca-epti=undefined&amp;gca-ft=0&amp;gca-ds=sophi">Michigan</a> are considering bans in various forms, no democracy has yet outlawed VPN usage.</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.trustedinternet.io/blog/global-guide-to-vpn-usage">countries that do ban VPNs</a> are the ones you&#39;d probably expect — those with deep-rooted internet censorship regimes that VPN use might threaten. Belarus, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea and Turkmenistan have made all VPNs illegal. In China, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Uganda and Iran, only state-approved VPNs are permitted, and services that get approved tend to have government backdoors.</p>
<p>Other countries heavily restrict VPNs without banning them altogether, including Turkey and Pakistan. In India, VPNs are legal, but the law requires them to keep logs of user activities. The law&#39;s passage in 2022 led many VPNs to pull their servers from India and replace them with virtual locations.</p>
<p>Finally, there are countries like Egypt where using a VPN is legal, but you&#39;ll face extra penalties if you&#39;re caught using one to commit a crime. Also, it should go without saying, but VPNs don&#39;t make crime legal. If something is illegal without a VPN, it&#39;s illegal with a VPN, even if VPNs themselves are allowed in your state and country.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-are-vpns-free"><strong>Are VPNs free?</strong></h2>
<p>Some of them are, but many of them are dangerous. If you&#39;ve just been faced with a new threat to your online freedom — like, say, <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html">the UK&#39;s new age restriction laws</a> — it can be tempting to jump to a free VPN to solve the problem quickly.</p>
<p>But free VPNs are easy to hack together, and app stores rarely probe them for violations before listing them. I frequently see free VPNs that either don&#39;t work, track you for ad sales or even <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/malware-apps-posing-as-free-vpns-are-on-the-rise-175629088.html">sneak malware onto your computer</a>. Another big problem is that many of these shovelware VPNs are all secretly run by <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html">the same monolithic entities</a>.</p>

<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html">best free VPNs</a> are free plans offered by paid services. With subscription fees supporting the free tier, you don&#39;t need to worry that the real money comes from selling your information to advertisers. Proton VPN, hide.me, Windscribe, TunnelBear and PrivadoVPN all fall into this category. None of them show you ads, but they&#39;re all restricted in other ways, whether by the amount you can use the VPN per month, the speeds you&#39;ll get or the servers you can access.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-do-i-need-a-vpn"><strong>Do I need a VPN?</strong></h2>
<p>If you use the internet — which you must, if you&#39;re reading this — you&#39;ll benefit from a VPN. To determine what you&#39;ll need it for, though, ask yourself the following questions. If you answer yes to any of them, think about subscribing to a VPN to address the problem in question.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do you feel strongly about whether your ISP and other third parties can see what you do online and use that information for profit?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you live in a place where the law prevents you from freely using the internet and/or forbids certain platforms?</p></li>
<li><p>Have online freedoms been temporarily suspended in your country because of unrest?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you planning to travel to a country with restrictive internet laws?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you normally use the internet on a network that restricts access to certain sites?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you use the internet for any tasks that would risk your own safety or someone else&#39;s if exposed?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you often get online through public Wi-Fi networks or networks without passwords?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you concerned that your ISP is throttling your internet speeds?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want to watch TV shows and movies that aren&#39;t available in your country on the streaming services you&#39;re subscribed to?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want to watch events that are limited to specific regions, such as local sports?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you enjoy looking in various regions for better deals on products you want?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you an online gamer concerned about doxxing and/or DDoS attacks from sore losers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Different VPNs have features that make them better at various tasks from the lists above.

Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tools/compare/tcl-qm7k-vs-hisense-u75qg/88608/96104">some reviews</a> say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content <em>too</em> bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it&#39;s not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set.

That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks short of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-20-is-googles-most-capable-ai-model-yet-and-available-to-preview-today-170329180.html"><ins>Gemini 2&#39;s first birthday</ins></a>, Google has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3"><ins>announced Gemini 3 Pro</ins></a>. Naturally, the company claims the new system is its most intelligent AI model yet, offering state-of-the-art reasoning, class-leading vibe coding performance and more. The good news is you can put those claims to the test today, with Google making Gemini 3 Pro available across many of its products and services.</p>
<p>Google is highlighting a couple of benchmarks to tout Gemini 3 Pro&#39;s performance. In <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://agi.safe.ai/"><ins>Humanity&#39;s Last Exam</ins></a>, widely considered one of the toughest tests AI labs can put their systems through, the model delivered a new top accuracy score of 37.5 percent, beating the previous leader, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-must-spent-almost-an-hour-talking-about-grok-without-mentioning-its-nazi-problem-061101656.html">Grok 4</a>, by an impressive 12.1 percentage points. Notably, it achieved its score without turning to tools like web search. On <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard"><ins>LMArena</ins></a>, meanwhile, Gemini 3 Pro is now on top of the site&#39;s leaderboards with a score of 1,501 points.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Okay, but what about the practical benefits of Gemini 3 Pro? In the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-gemini-app"><ins>Gemini app</ins></a>, the new model will translate to answers that are more concise and better formatted. It also enables a new feature Google calls Gemini Agent. The tool builds on <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/jarvis-googles-web-browsing-ai-is-now-officially-known-as-project-mariner-191603929.html"><ins>Project Mariner</ins></a>, the web-surfing Chrome AI the company debuted at the end of last year. It allows users to ask Gemini to complete tasks for them. For example, say you want help managing your email inbox. In the past, Gemini would have offered some general tips. Now, it can do that work for you.</p>
<p>To try Gemini 3 Pro inside of the Gemini app, select &quot;Thinking&quot; from the model picker. The new model is available to everyone, though AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers can use it more often before hitting their rate limit. To make the most of Gemini Agent, you&#39;ll need to grant the tool access to your Google apps.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="http://blog.google/products/search/gemini-3-search-ai-mode">In Search</a>, meanwhile, Gemini 3 Pro will debut inside of <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html"><ins>AI Mode</ins></a>, with availability of the new model first rolling out to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. Google will also bring the model to AI Overviews, where it will be used to answer the most difficult questions people ask of its search engine. In the coming weeks, Google plans to roll out a new routing algorithm for both AI Mode and AI Overviews that will know when to put questions through Gemini 3 Pro. In the meantime, subscribers can try the new model inside of AI Mode by selecting &quot;Thinking&quot; from the dropdown menu.</p>

" data-uuid="f1fb023f-88cb-336b-b394-69bfd2fc1bd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>In practice, Google says Gemini 3 Pro will result in AI Mode finding more credible and relevant content related to your questions. This is thanks to how the new model augments the fan-out technique that powers AI Mode. The tool will perform even more searches than before and with its new intelligence, Google suggests it may even uncover content previous models may have missed. At the same time, Gemini 3&#39;s better multi-modal understanding will translate to AI Mode generating more dynamic and interactive interfaces to answer your questions. For example, if you&#39;re researching mortgage loans, the tool can create a loan calculator directly inside of its response.</p>
<p>For developers and its enterprise customers, Google is bringing Gemini 3 to all the usual places one can find its models, including inside of the Gemini API, AI Studio and Vertex AI. The company is also releasing a new agentic coding app called Antigravity. It can autonomously program while creating tasks for itself and providing progress reports. Alongside Gemini 3 Pro, Google is introducing Gemini 3 Deep Think. The enhanced reasoning mode will be available to safety testers before it rolls out to AI Ultra subscribers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device&#39;s low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff.</p>

While Analogue&#39;s other systems honored the golden age of 2D gaming, the pinnacle of pixel art in many ways, the N64 ushered gamers into the early, ugly days of 3D gaming. Nearly three decades after its initial release, most N64 games look pretty catastrophic by modern standards. Can the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Analogue 3D ($250)</a> treatment save them?</p>

<h2 id="29eb67a5-9346-4c46-8608-7c0caf936efa">Origin Story</h2>
<p>The early to mid-&#39;90s were a heady time for console gaming. Sega and Nintendo had printed so much money in the 16-bit era that both were throwing everything they could at the wall to capture the fluorescent pink, velcro wallets of the gamers of the day. Wild controllers, endless system add-ons and even <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_VR" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">virtual reality</a> were in the cards.</p>
<p>But it would be the humble CD-ROM that really pushed things forward. Sega did its own multimedia add-on in-house, with the Sega CD. Nintendo decided to team up with Sony for the development of its own disc drive. When that project fell apart, Sony famously decided to continue on, releasing the original PlayStation in 1995.</p>
<p>Almost overnight, the gaming world was all about three-dimensional gaming, a landscape that Sega&#39;s Saturn was ill-prepared for. Nintendo, though, went all-in for its next system, the Nintendo 64. It not only packed more polygons and colors than Sony&#39;s system, but Nintendo finally cracked the code of how to make a truly good three-dimensional platformer with <em>Mario 64</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mario 64</em> is not only a great game, it became the template for how player and camera controls worked, defining rules that still exist today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N64 was also the first mainstream console to feature an analog controller out of the box, the first console since the Atari 5200 in the early &#39;80s to have four controller ports and the first American console to offer haptic feedback in the form of 1997&#39;s Rumble Pak. Today it all sounds quaint, but it was a truly revolutionary machine back in the day.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D is somewhat revolutionary as well, but for different reasons. At its core, it relies on a field programmable gate array, or FPGA, much like Analogue&#39;s previous devices (the Super Nt, Mega Sg, Pocket and Duo). An FPGA is effectively a processor full of virtual building blocks, called logic elements, which enable it to replicate any other system. It takes a massive amount of configuration, but the result is pure hardware emulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, it’s the same concept as Analogue&#39;s previous devices, just on a massively larger scale. Where the Pocket used an Altera Cyclone V FPGA with 49,000 logic elements, this one uses an Intel Cyclone 10 GX FPGA clocking in at 220,000 logic elements. While Analogue never gave much in the way of explanation, it&#39;s likely that the extreme complexity that resulted in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">delay</a> after <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-will-at-long-last-ship-on-november-18-151854397.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">annoying delay</a> — well, that and the complexities of running an international business in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-threatens-a-25-percent-tariff-on-all-smartphones-not-made-in-the-us-195122531.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">tariff-laden minefield</a> that is today&#39;s global trading landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Analogue 3D very much follows the same aesthetic seen in the company&#39;s previous units: a minimalist take on the original hardware. It looks like a smaller and thinner N64 — one that requires active cooling, by the way, so make sure you don&#39;t crowd this thing in among your other, lesser game consoles.</p>
<p>It (virtually) supports all the N64&#39;s key accessories, like the Transfer Pak, the Expansion Pak and the Rumble Pak. It&#39;s USB-C powered and output comes via HDMI, and you&#39;ll find the requisite cables included in the box. There&#39;s also an SD card around the back for firmware updates and a pair of USB-A ports for good measure. Up front, you&#39;ll find four controller ports, with the distinctive circular style used by the N64. But you can connect controllers via USB or wirelessly too, if you prefer.</p>

<p>The system&#39;s default controller is again <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-40-analogue-3d-controller-arrives-on-march-19-200752420.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">provided by 8BitDo</a>, which has created special designs for Analogue&#39;s other recent releases. For better or worse, the $39.99 8BitDo 64 controller doesn&#39;t imitate the three-pronged N64 style, but does offer all that system&#39;s buttons in a more traditional layout. It&#39;s perhaps too traditional, difficult to tell apart from Nintendo&#39;s own <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-13-nintendo-switch-pro-controller.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Switch Pro controller</a> from a distance.</p>
<p>I haven’t been a fan of 8BitDo controllers in the past. Given the premium Analogue charges for its systems, the 8BitDo controllers haven&#39;t risen to that level of polish. This new generation, though, is definitely a step up. The controller&#39;s buttons don&#39;t rattle when you shake it, the inputs have a good feel to them, the vibration isn&#39;t harsh and pairing is quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I did run into latency issues if I was more than about 10 feet away from the system, or if I closed the door on the cabinet that held the Analogue 3D. That&#39;s a far cry from the connectivity of a Switch Pro controller, which I can readily use from another room if I&#39;m ever so inclined.</p>

<p>Analogue has made a name for itself by obsessing over striking the perfect blend of honoring original systems while making them great in a modern world. If I may insert one automotive reference, they are doing to game systems what Singer Vehicle Design does to Porsches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But where cars both old and reimagined look great on the same road, vintage consoles struggle with modern TVs. Plug an original N64 into your 4K HDTV via a tangle of adapters, and you&#39;ll get a blurry, blocky mess that will make you question everything your childhood self held dear. Even if you go the hardcore route with something like an Open Source Scan Converter or an HDMI mod kit to take vintage analog signals and turn them into modern digital ones, you&#39;re still probably not going to like the results. That&#39;s because it isn&#39;t all about getting crisp signals from console to display. These systems were designed for cathode rays, where one colored pixel bled into the next to create a seamless view to hide many of the N64&#39;s 320 x 240 flaws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D goes to great lengths to replicate that look through a series of filters meant to replicate everything from a consumer-grade CRT to the sort of professional-grade monitor that cost as much as a new car did back in the &#39;90s. Analogue has experimented with these filters in the past, but they&#39;re taken to a new level here, with options for specifying monitor type, quality and size. The results are quite impressive, still a bit grittier than a giant-sized CRT would be in real life, but looking miles better than the unfiltered view of the games. You can even tune and tweak those display settings on a per-game basis, if you&#39;re especially finicky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#39;ll have to take my word for that. The 4K CRT effects don&#39;t really show up through a capture card, and as of now the Analogue 3D has no integrated screen capture functionality. That, I was told, is coming later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started my testing with the game that, in the eyes of many, represents the high-water mark of the N64 experience: <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Rare&#39;s classic first-person shooter shares a lot of its concepts (and surely its code) with that other N64 icon, <em>Goldeneye</em>. But, in the three years between those games, developers learned plenty of tricks, resulting in a game that really pushed the hardware to its limits.</p>
<p>Or past its limits, really. <em>Perfect Dark</em> was equally famous for its uneven frame rates. Expecting a one-to-one recreation of the original hardware, I was surprised to find the game running buttery smooth on the Analogue 3D. How?</p>
<p>The system includes a series of tweaking and tuning options, including something of a baked-in overclocking function. By default, it&#39;s on Auto, which, at least in the case of <em>Perfect Dark</em>, dialed up the Analogue 3D&#39;s power to make up for the original system&#39;s polygon processing shortcomings. But the Analogue 3D is nothing if not tweakable, and with a few taps into the system&#39;s menu, I was able to turn that off.</p>
<p>Now locked into &quot;Force Original Hardware&quot; mode, <em>Perfect Dark</em> played just like it did back in the day, a shaky and jittery testament to the overachieving aspirations of Rare&#39;s developers. And, thanks to more settings adjustments, I could enable the 16:9 mode in <em>Perfect Dark</em> and stretch the video output on the Analogue 3D, getting a proper widescreen effect — even though the game doesn&#39;t output a full 16:9 grid of pixels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond Auto, you can set the game to run in Enhanced, Enhanced+ and Unleashed speeds. I switched over to another game notorious for its poor performance: <em>Superman: The New Superman Adventures</em>. I initially reviewed this game way back in 1999, and it has since become notorious as one of the worst of all time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s no better today, but thanks to the Analogue 3D, it is at least more fluid. The game&#39;s choppiness is gone, replaced by a too-rapid pace to the uninspired ring-chasing gameplay. Sadly, the faster frame rate doesn&#39;t make up for the omnipresent green fog that makes <em>Superman 64 </em>feel so claustrophobic. Neither does it fix the crunchy, murky textures that surround you in <em>Perfect Dark</em>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not all bad, though. 1997&#39;s <em>Super Robot Spirits</em>, a giant robot fighting game released only in Japan, features untextured 3D models that use Gouraud shading to look a little less blocky. The result looks genuinely crisp and clean on the Analogue <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://3D.So" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">3D.So</a> too do games like <em>Mario Kart 64</em> and <em>Yoshi&#39;s Story</em>, 3D games that rely heavily on 2D elements, which scale very nicely up to a modern, 65-inch 4K OLED, like the LG B7 I used for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were few games that really popped for me. Much of the time, I was stuck looking at blurry, blocky textures poking out of foggy landscapes that were far less breathtaking than I remembered them 25-plus years ago.</p>

<p>Analogue&#39;s earlier systems take some of the greatest 2D games ever made and elevate them to crisply defined, high-resolution pixel art. They are gorgeous and charming to behold, which just makes them all the more engaging to play. Sadly, few of the games on the N64 stand up so well. Making these games look truly good would require pushing back the omnipresent fog and upscaling the ugly textures that plague many N64 games. That, it&#39;s safe to say, would go well past the point of faithful recreation that Analogue strives for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to fault the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Analogue 3D</a> itself for this. The hardware does a remarkable job of recreating that original experience. My N64 library has never looked better, and I am definitely enjoying digging into games I haven&#39;t played in decades, plus a few newly acquired gems that I missed back in the day. But, more often than not, I&#39;m left shaking my head at just how bad these games looked, and no amount of 4K upscaling and CRT emulation can fix that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xbox has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/18/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-2/"><ins>revealed</ins></a> the last batch of Game Pass additions for November along with a couple of titles that are coming to the service in December. Starting today, though, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-crew-subscription-battle-pass-v-bucks-outfits-accessories-150000281.html"><ins>Fortnite Crew</ins></a> subscription at no extra cost.</p>
<p>That includes access to the current <em>Fortnite </em>battle pass, along with the OG pass, Lego pass, music pass and<em> Rocket League</em>’s rocket pass premium. On top of that, Fortnite Crew puts 1,000 V-Bucks in subscribers’ wallets every month.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft announced Fortnite Crew as a perk for Game Pass Premium in early October, when it jacked up the price of the service <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html"><ins>to $30 per month</ins></a>. Still, it’s a decent value add for <em>Fortnite </em>players, given that a Crew membership costs $12 per month by itself. Seems like as good a reason as any to check out the current Simpsons-themed season of <em>Fortnite Battle Royale </em>if you have an Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>As for the games that are joining the service over the next couple of weeks, there are two day-one additions to Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass. Action RPG title <em>Moonlighted 2: The Endless Vault </em>joins the lineup as a PC-only game preview on November 19.</p>
<p>Then, on December 1, a game we’re pretty darn excited for joins the fray in the form of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nostalgic-beat-em-up-marvel-cosmic-invasion-is-out-on-december-1-172217400.html"><em><ins>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</ins></em></a>. This is a sidescrolling beat-‘em-up from Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu, the same tandem that brought us the terrific <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-185022231.html"><em><ins>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</ins></em></a>. You can choose from a roster of 15 fighters in <em>Cosmic Invasion</em>, including Iron Man, Phoenix/Jean Grey, Spider-Man and Wolverine. The demo is a blast, so here&#39;s hoping for more of that from the full game, which is also coming to Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PS4 and PS5 on December 1.</p>
<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is a spiritual successor to Life is Strange from the creator of that series, Don&#39;t Nod. It <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/life-is-strange-spiritual-successor-delayed-to-avoid-life-is-strange-sequel-124553471.html"><ins>debuted earlier this year</ins></a> and it&#39;s coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Premium, as well as PC Game Pass, for cloud, PC and Xbox Series X/S on December 2. Don&#39;t Nod is also behind last year&#39;s action RPG <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, which I enjoyed quite a bit. That&#39;s coming to the same Game Pass tiers on the same platforms on November 25.</p>
<p>The other Game Pass additions for the next two weeks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo </em>(cloud, console and PC) – November 19, arriving on Game Pass Premium</p></li>
<li><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet </em>(cloud, PC and Xbox Series X/S) – November 19, arriving on Game Pass Premium</p></li>
<li><p><em>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road </em>(<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html">handheld</a> and PC) – November 20 on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Crew Motorfest </em>(cloud, console and PC) – November 20 on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</p></li>
<li><p><em>Kill It With Fire! 2 </em>(cloud, console, and PC) – November 25 on Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the titles leaving Game Pass this month, <em>Barbie Project Friendship, Lords of the Fallen, Octopath Traveler, Octopath Traveler II and SteamWorld Build </em>(all for cloud, console and PC) will depart the service for the time being on November 30.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-now-includes-a-fortnite-crew-subscription-151826277.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-best-black-friday-2025-deals-on-tech-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-ahead-of-the-big-sale-100052689.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon MGM has released another <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYsnngkS_U">full-length trailer</a> for <em>Project Hail Mary</em> and we are already at the theater seated. The three minute and four second trailer shows Ryan Gosling as Dr. Ryland Grace, a school teacher and former biologist who wakes up on a spacecraft with no idea who he is or why he&#39;s there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkcENinRJ-g">first trailer</a> gave us a look at <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-project-hail-mary-trailer-looks-like-the-martian-all-over-again-in-a-great-way-142119896.html">Dr. Grace&#39;s first moments</a> after waking up and an overview of his mission: find the one star in the universe that&#39;s not dying and save the world — no big deal. Today&#39;s trailer gives us a better idea of how he&#39;ll go about this and the alien he teams up with along the way. Check it out for yourself on Amazon MGM&#39;s YouTube channel <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYsnngkS_U">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ryan-gosling-and-millerlords-project-hail-mary-could-be-the-sci-fi-event-of-2026-174440164.html"><em>Project Hail Mary</em></a> is adapted from Andy Weir&#39;s novel of the same name. Weir also wrote <em>The Martian</em>, which was successfully turned into a 2015 film starring Matt Damon. This time around, Oscar-winning filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are directing with a screenplay by Drew Goddard — the latter also wrote the adaptation of <em>The Martian</em> so we&#39;re in good hands. The movie also stars Sandra Hüller as the head of the titular <em>Project Hail Mary.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see <em>Project Hail Mary</em> for yourself on March 20, 2026 in theaters and IMAX.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/project-hail-mary-keeps-us-intrigued-in-a-second-trailer-151108278.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming.</p> 
<p>Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive.</p> 
<p>If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mastodon&#39;s founder Eugen Rochko has officially <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/the-future-is-ours-to-build-together/">stepped down as CEO</a>. The move comes ten months after the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodon-will-soon-be-owned-by-a-nonprofit-entity-170009789.html">company announced</a> it would transition into a nonprofit entity and that Rochko would leave his post. Rochko will take on an advisory role with the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/my-next-chapter-with-mastodon/">blog post</a> about this decision, Rochko pointed to a desire for guardrails to avoid becoming another egotistical founder &quot;sabotaging thriving communities.&quot; He added, &quot;But it would be uncouth for me to pretend that there isn’t some self-interest involved. Being in charge of a social media project is, turns out, quite the stressful endeavour, and I don’t have the right personality for it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his place, Felix Hlatky has taken on the role of executive director. Hlatky has worked at Mastodon since March 2020 and plans to focus on expanding the team, long-term financial stability and making it easier to run servers safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Currently, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodon-is-adding-bluesky-like-starter-packs-182014446.html">Mastodon</a> is operating as a nonprofit in the US, but aims to set up a permanent home base as a nonprofit in Belgium, known as an AISBL. Mastodon previously held nonprofit status in Germany but lost that it last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastodon has pursued outside funding since its announced transition to a nonprofit. It shared that Stock Exchange co-founder Jeff Atwood and his family gave the organization €2.2 million ($2.5 million). Part of that influx of cash has gone toward hiring new employees in its engineering, marketing, operations and product teams. Rochko also received a one-time €1 million ($1.2 million) compensation after ten years of &quot;taking less than a fair market salary.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mastodons-founder-is-no-longer-its-ceo-143011438.html?src=rss]]></description>

That was me not too long ago when I started searching for something that could get rid of the pilling on some of my most loved pieces of clothing. Blessedly, I stumbled upon the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B00E3862DE&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c2468424-8ef5-4416-9d94-da26698b7118&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Philips+Fabric+Shaver&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAVcx60_ADYIA86h9WZgtpm2NyeAbUNCrS3qu83o3rv7L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes%2Fdp%2FB00E3862DE%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes/dp/B00E3862DE/?th=1">Philips Fabric Shaver</a>, a type of device I didn&#39;t even know existed, and decided to give it a shot. It&#39;s now an essential piece of tech in my house, and you don&#39;t have to pay as much as I did for it thanks to this Black Friday deal that knocks it down to $13.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="848802afed304ca5b041be2cdb9f74de" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-GC026-Electric-Removers-Clothes/dp/B00E3862DE/?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Sure, it may not seem revolutionary — especially if you already knew of the wonders of such devices — but it was for me. I have a lot of T-shirts, joggers, sweaters and more that I&#39;ve had for at least three years and wear regularly. We also have a bunch of throw blankets around the house, partially because I love a good throw, and partially because my cat demands soft spots on which to sleep. All of those well-worn, well-loved fabrics have pilled over time, and I was tired of picking at the pills myself.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>This Philips Fabric Shaver makes it so I never have to do that anymore. It runs on two AA batteries, has a simple on-off switch and a shaving head with three sized holes that, as you glide it over your sweater or blanket, catches the pills and shaves them right off. It&#39;s literally as simple as that; after I tried it the first time on a pair of joggers, I spent far too much time running around my house and through my closet de-pilling as many things as I could. All the little fabric bits collect in a removable chamber that you simply empty as often as you need into the trash. If you&#39;re like me and try to make the most of the wardrobe you have and not buy new clothing all the time, this little gadget will keep the pieces in your closet looking fresh.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/my-favorite-fabric-shaver-is-on-sale-for-only-13-in-this-black-friday-deal-163402654.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Admittedly, we have seen this model a bit cheaper in the past, but if you’re on cooking duty for Thanksgiving, you might not have the option of waiting until what <em>could</em> be a deeper discount on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-tech-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-anker-and-others-100052831.html">Black Friday</a>. And the DZ401 is the perfect air fryer for the holiday season, owing to its trademark dual baskets, which allow you to cook up two completely different foods simultaneously. It takes up a fair amount of space, but it’s worth it if you have a lot of hungry mouths to feed.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>This 10-quart fryer includes a smart cook thermometer and six cooking modes, including air broil, roast and dehydrate alongside the default air fry mode. The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert.</p> 
<p>The Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">buying guide</a> for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better.</p>

As <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interplay-co-founder-rebecca-heineman-dies-from-cancer" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em></a> has reported, her friends and colleagues from the industry broke the news on their social media accounts. According to Heineman’s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">GoFundMe campaign,</a> she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma a few months ago. In her last update, she revealed that “all further treatments [were] pointless” and that all donations will go towards her funeral being arranged by her children. Heineman’s last post on Instagram was a tribute to her wife Jennell Jaquays who died in 2024 due complications brought by Guillain–Barré syndrome. </p><p>Heineman won the Atari 2600 Space Invaders championship in 1980 before she was offered a job as a programmer at 16 years old by Avalon Hill Games. She then co-founded Interplay as Interplay Productions back in 1983 with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel and Troy Worrell. Under Interplay, she designed <em>The Bard&#39;s Tale III: Thief of Fate</em> among other games. In 1999, she founded Contraband Entertainment, which worked on the Mac OS ports for <em>Aliens vs. Predator</em> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-07-baldurs-gate-2-enhanced-edition-encounters-a-release-date.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Baldur&#39;s Gate II</a>. Heineman also worked as a senior software engineer at Electronic Arts, senior engine programmer at Ubisoft Toronto and senior software architect at Sony Computer Entertainment America. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/interplay-co-founder-rebecca-heineman-dies-133000414.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset for the price, and scored a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html">90 in Engadget&#39;s review</a>, landing it among our picks for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html">the best VR headsets</a> around right now. It&#39;s comfortable to wear, gets over two hours of battery life before needing to be recharged and offers a 96-degree field of view. While its 1,830 by 1,920 pixel per eye screen doesn&#39;t quite achieve the sharpness of the Quest 3, it does have the same chip — the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 — as the pricier model, making for fast performance. It also comes with 8GB of RAM.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The Quest 3S also comes with the Touch Plus controllers, which have button and joystick controls as well as motion controls. It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience. In his review, Engadget&#39;s Devindra Hardawar said the 3S is &quot;the best $300 standalone VR headset we&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-include-the-meta-quest-3s-for-a-record-low-price-180911231.html?src=rss]]></description>

We called them the best option for &quot;blocking distractions&quot; and that &quot;Bose’s tweaks make its best earbuds even better.&quot; The earbuds have enhanced call quality and further improved ANC filters than their predecessors. They also offer improved comfort and a new guard designed to prevent wax build up — something that all earbud users know is very important.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, the newer model offers the same six hours of battery life per charge — four when using Immersive Audio — as the originals. Plus, despite the improved comfort, they still have the bulkier design that&#39;s not going to be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>

<p>As Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham notes, Zelda appears with a bow and quiver, so hopefully it’s a more modern spin than the damsel-in-distress original. I mean, the game is <em>named</em> for her. Filming has just started, so this is all we have until a proper trailer arrives.</p>

<p>DJI’s latest drone — and it’s hard to keep track — is the Neo 2. It’s a relatively inexpensive, lightweight model for creators and hobbyists, and it’s loaded with new features, like LiDAR obstacle detection, improved video quality, and longer battery life. Gesture control is a major new Neo 2 feature that isn’t on other DJI drones. Wave a hand up, down or sideways to climb and bank, move two hands apart or together to make it approach or move away, clench a fist to stop it and hold out your palm to land. Like a bird! Manual flight controls on your smartphone is another new feature not on other DJI drones. It’s also only slightly more expensive than its predecessor.</p>

<p>There have never been more remote workers in my life, so finding a sweet present to improve their nine-to-five has often been my approach. We’ve rounded up a few techy ideas that should make their days a little more delightful — and we didn’t even suggest noise-cancelling headphones. Because they probably already have them.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-"></h3>
<p>Meta and Google are facing delays with long-promised undersea cable projects, according to a report by <em>Bloomberg</em>. A Meta spokesperson blames the delays on a “range of operational factors, regulatory concerns and geopolitical risk.” Meta’s 2Africa subsea cable system is designed to give fiber internet to the African continent. It’s also intended to connect Europe with Asia and Africa. The Google-backed Blue-Raman intercontinental cable system in the region has also been delayed, following its initial announcement in 2021. The company has not provided an updated timeline.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DJI has released its third action cam in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-nano-review-high-quality-video-in-a-truly-tiny-action-cam-120040319.html">less than</a> four months, the Osmo Action 6. The new GoPro rival offers something we've never seen in this type of camera: a variable aperture for more control over exposure. It also has a new, square sensor (like the one we saw on the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html">Osmo 360</a>) that makes it easier to crop video for social media-friendly aspect ratios. I've had the Osmo Action 6 for a few days and it looks impressive so far.</p> 
<p>Rather than a fixed f/2.8 setting as before, the Osmo Action 6 offers a variable f/2.0-4.0 aperture, which offers several benefits. When at f/2.0, it allows twice as much light as before. That in turn allows for higher shutter speeds in dim conditions, which reduces the motion blur that can hurt image quality and stabilization. It also delivers shallower depth of field to help separate the subject from the background. On sunny days, meanwhile, changing the aperture to f/4.0 lets you <em>lower</em> the shutter speed so video looks less staccato and more natural.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Oddly, DJI doesn't let you fully control the f-stop, however. You can either choose a fixed aperture at f/2.8, or Auto aperture with a range of ISOs, varying from f/2.0 - 4.0 up to f/2.8 - 4.0. That's unfortunate, as it would be nice to be able to select a fixed f/2.0 aperture, for example, to have a shallow depth of field for portraits. (Note that you can pick an f/4.0 fixed aperture as well to get a "starburst" pattern on bright parts of the image.)</p> 
<p>The Action 6 has a new, 1/1.1-inch square sensor (9.8 x 9.8mm), as well. It doesn't boost resolution as some people had <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/1ow97r7/contrary_to_rumours_the_osmo_action_6_doesnt/">hoped</a>, but does allow for more aspect ratio choices. As with the Action 5, video can be shot at up to 4K 120 fps, or 4K at 60 fps in SuperNight Mode. However, it now offers a 4K Custom mode that lets you capture 3,840 x 3,840 square video at up to 60 fps, for cropping at full 4K resolution in both horizontal and vertical formats. It also supports 4:3 4K (3,840 x 2,880) at up to 120 fps for more cropping options when shooting slo-mo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new sensor is also considerably larger than the 1/1.3-inch sensor on the Osmo Action 5 and the 1/1.9-inch sensor on the GoPro 13. That allows for improved low-light performance, according to DJI, and the larger pixels also boost dynamic range to a claimed 13.5 stops. That, combined with DJI's D-LogM and 10-bit capability, should make footage from the Osmo Action 6 easy to adjust, even on high contrast sunny days.</p> 
<p>DJI has also taken a page from Fujifilm by introducing a Film Tone function to get six distinct looks straight out of the camera, including "cool tones," "classic negative film" and "pleasing skin tones." The Osmo Action 6 also offers a 2x lossless zoom (a digital zoom, effectively), portrait mode and subject centering and tracking. Finally, the new "Natural Wide" mode gives you a wider field of view without the usual ugly distortion at the corners.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For closeup photography, the Action 6 is available with an optional macro lens, as well as an FOV Boost lens that increases the field of view from 155 to 182 degrees.</p>

<p>From my tests so far, low-light video quality looks considerably cleaner and more color-accurate than the Action 5. In addition, the SuperNight Mode is more useful as shutter speeds are higher and thus stabilization in low light is improved over the Action 5. I'll have more information in my full review, coming soon.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are a number of other improvements as well. DJI has boosted the internal storage to 50GB from 47GB before, so you can largely shoot without a memory card, though a microSD slot is also available. As before, it's waterproof to 20 meters (66 feet) by itself, or nearly 200 feet with DJI's waterproof case. And on top of voice control, the Action 6 now supports gestures as well. With the same 1,950mAh Extreme Battery Plus as before, shooting time between charges is 4 hours at 1080p and 2 hours at 4K, both with Rocksteady 3.0 stabilization enabled and the screen off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Osmo Action 6 is compatible with DJI's increasingly generous accessory lineup, like selfie sticks, bike, helmet and body attachments, suction mounts and more. However, the company upgraded its Quick-Release Adapter Mount to a dual-latch system (first introduced on the Osmo Nano) that "can be attached in either direction without mechanical limitations," the company said. That's a big quality-of-life improvement over the old mounts, which could only be attached one way. That said, the old mounts are still compatible with the new camera and vice-versa.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So what about US availability? It looks like, as with the Osmo 360 and Osmo Nano, that DJI's Action 6 won't be available on the company's US store, but it will be sold at Amazon, B&amp;H Photo Video and other third-party resellers, with pricing tba. In Europe, the Osmo Action 6 is now available at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:DJI;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cb41ef03-1ad2-4c66-aa8c-e41e32bd0e16&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DJI&amp;linkText=DJI%27s+store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmRqaS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjYjQxZWYwMy0xYWQyLTRjNjYtYWE4Yy1lNDFlMzJiZDBlMTYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RvcmUuZGppLmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWKeZwbVZ18Px-lGZHy2y92Ex-CUWHf4v8GFmJGHqDpJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://store.dji.com/">DJI's store</a> and Amazon at €379 for the standard combo with one battery, or €479 in the Adventure Combo that includes three batteries and the Battery Case 3 charger.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roblox is starting to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">roll out</a> the mandatory age checks that will require all of its users to submit an ID or scan their face in order to access the platform&#39;s chat features. The updated policy, which the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-will-require-age-verification-for-all-users-to-access-communication-features-203653330.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">announced</a> earlier this year, will be enforced first in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands and will expand to all other markets by early next year.</p><p>The company also detailed a new &quot;age-based chat&quot; system, which will limit users&#39; ability to interact with people outside of their age group. After verifying or estimating a user&#39;s age, Roblox will assign them to an age group ranging from 9 years and younger to 21 years and older (there are six total age groups). Teens and children will then be limited from connecting with people that aren&#39;t in or close to their estimated age group in in-game chats.</p><p>Unlike most social media apps which have a minimum age of 13, Roblox permits much younger children to use its platform. Since most children and many teens don&#39;t have IDs, the company uses &quot;age estimation&quot; tech provided by identity company Persona. The checks, which use video selfies, are conducted within Roblox&#39;s app and the company says that images of users&#39; faces are immediately deleted after completing the process.</p><p>Roblox didn&#39;t provide details on how accurate its age estimation features are, but the company&#39;s Chief Safety Officer, Matt Kaufman, said that it was &quot;pretty accurate&quot; at guessing the approximate age of most of its users. &quot;What we find is that the algorithms between that 5 and 25 years old [range] are typically pretty accurate within one or two years of their age,&quot; he said during a briefing with reporters.</p><p>A spokesperson for Roblox later added that Personas’s models  “achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.4 years for minors under 18 based on testing by the Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) in UK.” Parents are also able to adjust their child’s birthday in the app via its parental control settings. </p><p>All Roblox users can now voluntarily submit to a face scan or provide an ID to the company to ensure their access to its chat features isn&#39;t interrupted. The company says it will be enforcing age checks for all users by January and that people in the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand will need to comply beginning in early December. Next year, the company also plans to put age restrictions around users&#39; ability to access links to outside social media sites and to participate in Roblox Studio.&nbsp;</p><p>Roblox has repeatedly come under fire for alleged safety lapses even as it&#39;s released a flurry of child safety updates in recent years. The company is facing lawsuits from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-over-alleged-child-safety-lapses-131500288.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Texas</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Louisiana</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=AttorneyGeneral&amp;prId=1832" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Kentucky</a> amid <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/short-sellers-accuse-roblox-of-inflating-user-stats-and-enabling-child-exploitation-205635537.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">accusations</a> that it hasn&#39;t done enough to prevent adults from targeting teens and children on its service. </p><p><strong>Update, November 18, 2025, 9:45AM PT</strong>: This story was updated to add additional information from a Roblox spokesperson.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-begins-asking-tens-of-millions-of-children-to-verify-their-age-with-a-selfie-120000311.html?src=rss]]></description>

Of course, seasonal allergies, frightful weather and wildfires can all conspire to make open windows impossible. Air purifiers are your second best option. With sound-muffled fans and multi-layered filters, these simple machines can clear up odors, cooking emissions, dust particles, smoke, pet dander and more. We performed simple at-home tests to compare different models, mostly focusing on smart models with app control and auto modes. We compared the features, designs and prices to help you find the best air purifier for your home.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-an-air-purifier-can-and-cant-do">What an air purifier can and can’t do</h2> 
<p>There are three key categories of air pollution that adversely affect the quality of the air you breathe: volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and carbon dioxide. VOCs are emitted gasses that can come from cleaners, off-gassing plastics, paint, solvents, fragrances, cooking food and, ironically, air fresheners. VOCs are most closely related to odors you can smell. High levels can irritate your breathing passages, cause headaches and may become cancer-causing over time. Air purifiers with activated charcoal components can help clean VOCs from the air.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Particulate matter is usually discussed as PM2.5 and PM10, with the numbers indicating particle size in microns. This is dust, dirt, mold, smoke and, again, emissions from cooking food. Higher levels of PM can lead to respiratory irritation, allergy symptoms, respiratory infections and potentially lung cancer. Air purifiers that include a HEPA or particle filter can help remove airborne particles from your space.</p> 
<p>Carbon dioxide is what humans and pets breathe out. Elevated levels can cause dizziness and lethargy. But no air purifier can reduce CO2 levels because the molecules are so small. Plants can help to some extent, but really the only solution is opening a window or otherwise ventilating the space.</p> 
<p>There are <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-guidelines-are-available-compare-air-cleaners">no federal</a> standards for air purifiers, but the state of California does require all air cleaners sold in the state to be <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/list-carb-certified-air-cleaning-devices">certified</a> by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). All of our top picks here have met that certification.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-air-purifier">What to look for in an air purifier</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-hepa-filters-and-other-filter-types"><strong>HEPA filters and other filter types</strong></h3> 
<p>An air purifier isn’t an overly complicated device. Smart modes and app connectivity aside, they’re not much more than a filter and a fan, which <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-box-fan-air-filter-to-escape-the-canada-wildfire-smoke-172043312.html">you can certainly DIY</a>. The fan pulls air through the filter to capture particulate matter and other unhealthy elements so you don’t breathe them in. The type of fan can make some difference — it should be powerful enough to pull in air quickly, but also quiet enough on its low speed so it can unobtrusively clean all day long.</p> 
<p>Filters, on the other hand, are more varied. Most have two or more layers, typically a pre-filter, an activated carbon filter and sometimes a particle or even a true HEPA filter. The pre-filter is made from a fine mesh that captures big stuff like pet hair and larger chunks of dust. Sometimes this part is separate from the more technical filters — which means you can remove and clean it without needing to swap out the whole thing. For all-in-one filters, you can vacuum the outside of it to remove larger particles.</p> 
<p>An activated carbon or activated charcoal layer is extremely porous, tightly packed coal that presents a vast amount of microscopic surface area to the passing air. Gaseous chemicals, VOCs and other molecules become lodged in the crannys and stick. This is the layer that gets rid of odors.</p> 
<p>Nearly all types of air purifiers include a particle filter. Some of those can be called &quot;true HEPA&quot; (high-efficiency particulate air) filters — meaning they conform to the standards set out by the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.standards.doe.gov/standards-documents/3000/3020-astd-2015">DOE</a>. Particle filters are made up of pleated masses of ultrafine fibers that force air to take a convoluted path in order to pass through. This traps and absorbs tiny molecules of smoke and dust, allergens like dander and pollen, and some viruses and bacteria.</p> 
<p>Since all of these air filters physically trap particulates, they’ll eventually fill up and become less effective. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every six months, while others claim a year-long life span. Most smart air purifiers will let you know in the app when it’s time to replace. When you’re considering a unit’s cost, be sure to factor in the expense of replacement filters, which you may end up buying twice a year.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-room-size"><strong>Room size</strong></h3> 
<p>Air purifiers list their air filtration capabilities in terms of room size and frequency of air exchanges, sometimes listed as clean air delivery rate (CADR) or you may see a number for cubic feet per minute (CFM). A smaller unit might say it can exchange the air in a 500-square-foot room twice per hour. So that model should be able to pass all of the air in a 250-square-foot room through the filter every 15 minutes, but a 1,000-square-foot room would probably be outside its effective range. Of course, there’s no standard for manufacturers to adhere to when it comes to these calculations, but typically, larger air purifiers can handle large rooms.</p> 
<p><strong>Controls</strong></p> 
<p>In our testing, we focused on Wi-Fi-connected “smart” air purifiers with companion apps that can monitor air quality and adjust the fan settings as needed. Within the apps, you can control auto-clean settings, set timers and schedules and check the health of the filter as well. Most will remind you when it’s time to get a replacement, and let you order one directly from the manufacturer through the app. You can also see the current and historical readings from the internal air quality (AQ) sensor. Most determine air quality through an optical particle meter, though some brands like Dyson and Molekule also include chemical sensors for VOC measurements. When levels of particulates become elevated, the fans switch up to high speed to move more air through until the quality improves.</p> 
<p>Most smart purifiers also work with voice assistants, so if asking Alexa to turn on your air purifier makes your life easier in some way, you can do so. If you don’t want to talk to an AI or grab your phone to control your purifier, getting a unit with simple on-board controls is a good idea. These can be as basic as buttons with indicator lights or as elaborate as a touchscreen panel. At minimum, it’s good to have a way to control the fan speed and turn on or off auto mode on the device itself.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design"><strong>Design</strong></h3> 
<p>As we mentioned, sticking the device as close to the middle of the room is helpful for getting the best performance. That means you’ll be looking at it a lot, so design considerations matter. Most purifiers are cylindrical towers with fan vents up top. Units meant for larger rooms are not small, weighing between 12 and 20 pounds and reaching two feet tall (or in the case of the Dyson Purifier Cool, three and a half feet). Some, like Coway’s Airmega IconS, take on more furniture-like designs to blend in. Others, like Dyson&#39;s, are conspicuously designed to stand out.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-to-set-up-an-air-purifier">How to set up an air purifier</h3> 
<p>Even the best air purifier can’t do much without airflow. So ideally, you won’t shove your air purifier off in a corner right next to a wall. Most manufacturers recommend at least a foot of clearance between the machine and anything that could block circulation — walls, couches, cabinets and the like. Most cylindrical models have intake vents all around the outside, but box models may have them on just one side, so make sure you point the vents outwards towards the center of the room. Smaller air purifiers work better if they’re up off the ground by a couple feet, such as on top of a stool or end table. And of course, make sure the cord isn’t stretching across trafficked areas to avoid tripping.</p> 
<p>Before you plug your air purifier in, make sure to check that the filter isn’t wrapped in plastic inside the machine. I probably don’t need to tell you how I know this is a very important first step. The purifiers we recommend are smart home models, so the next step will usually involve downloading the manufacturer’s app to your phone and connecting the air purifier to the app as well as your home’s Wi-Fi.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-additional-steps-for-clearing-the-air">Additional steps for clearing the air</h3> 
<p>Air purifiers, as the name suggests, clean the air. Once dust, dander and smoke settle onto surfaces, there isn’t much these machines can do to eradicate them. So vacuuming and good old-fashioned dusting are important steps to keep allergens and particulate matter at bay. If you have an HVAC system, changing or even upgrading your system’s air filters can help keep bad air in check. The American Lung Association <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.lung.org/blog/indoor-air-quality-improvements">recommends</a> filters with at least a <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-and-disinfection-faq">MERV-13</a> rating. The association also recommends not burning candles in your home, foregoing air fresheners and opting for homemade <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.lung.org/getmedia/3030b2d9-02f0-4be4-ab86-d6bd86f88b88/ALA-Safe-cleaning-products-MHE-program-August-2022.pdf">cleaning supplies</a> over chemical cleaners.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-an-air-purifier-just-isnt-enough"><strong>When an air purifier just isn’t enough</strong></h3> 
<p>The most striking bit of knowledge I picked up from testing air purifiers is how effective opening windows can be on indoor air quality. What took an air purifier a half hour to clear out took mere minutes when I opened my front door and a few windows. Every variable measured by the air quality sensors, including VOCs, PM, and particularly CO2 levels (which air purifiers can’t alleviate), improved dramatically after exposure to fresh air — significantly faster and better than any machine we tested.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Letting in fresh air for just fifteen minutes each day can help, according to the Lung Association. On very cold days, do it midday. When it’s hot, open windows in the early morning when it’s coolest. When I did it in the middle of winter, my HVAC system had to work a little overtime afterwards, but venting a room was the most surefire way of getting air quality quickly back in the green.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, if the air outside is unhealthy from wildfire smoke or run-of-the-mill pollution, or if you&#39;re dealing with seasonal allergies, throwing open the windows won’t work and an air purifier might be the best way to consistently clean things up.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-air-purifiers">How we test air purifiers</h2> 
<p>My living room is not a science lab; there’s far too much pet hair for that to be the case.

I also just lived with them and evaluated how they fit into everyday life. As new purifiers come on the market we continue to acquire units that seem worthy of inclusion. Most recently, we tested purifiers from Blueair, IQAir, Windmill and others, adding our findings to this guide.</p>

It reminds me of a grown up version of Levoit’s Sprout purifier, which is geared towards kids with its white noise and night light functions. The Mini Restful is definitely small enough to pop on a night stand so it would be pretty handy if it could replace your alarm clock up there.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, those secondary functions feel a little incomplete. There’s no timer function for the night light, only manual control. The clock readout is on the top, making it impossible to view from bed if it&#39;s on your nightstand. The sunrise alarm clock will start lighting up at either 15 minutes or a half hour before the sound kicks in, but if the light happens to be enough to wake you, there’s no way to stop the alarm from sounding without getting out your phone.</p> 
<p>It performed well enough in its primary function, and got a smoky bedroom back to breathable in around a half an hour of running on high. (There’s no built-in sensor, so you have to manually adjust the fan through the app or onboard controls.) It’s also quiet enough to run all night on low — I’m fairly sensitive to noise and was able to sleep.</p>

The boxy tower looks like something you’d see in a hospital and weighs 35 pounds, making me appreciate the included wheels when I needed to move it around. It’s designed and made in Sweden and each unit comes with an impressive certificate of performance. I’m certain the testing processes IQAir employs are more scientific than my tests — after all, the company is probably best known for its air quality monitors — but I found the filtration efficiency to be on par with and, in one test, worse than that of other models I tested.</p> 
<p>I was also disappointed that a $1,000-plus air purifier from an air monitor device company was only capable of measuring particulate matter — and not VOCs — to trigger the auto-clean function. That said, setup was simple and the app can integrate data from public air quality sources as well as other AQ monitors you may have set up.</p>

It looks more like a tiny mid-century-modern credenza than an air purifier and the little shelf up top doubles as a wireless phone charger. The PM2.5 sensor reliably kicked in the auto mode as I used it and the three-speed fan is quiet, even on high, yet powerful. I had a little trouble getting the app to connect, but the onboard touch controls worked better anyway. It’s expensive at $699, too, but it does have a washable pre-filter.</p>

Unfortunately, replacement filters are $99 unless you subscribe to automatic shipments and many of the app features are behind a paywall as well. It’s not certified by CARB and underperformed many of the other units in the burn test, though it did return the air back to a “good” rating according to the air monitors after 30 minutes. The design is inoffensive, it’s not overly loud and it does integrate with Sensibo’s smart AC devices, so if you’re already happy with one of those, this may be a decent option.</p>

It looks like no other unit on the market and it’s up to you to decide whether you like that or not. I was indifferent to the looks, but appreciated the slick and informative app, which not only displays indoor air quality, it also shows what conditions are like outside, using a clever house graphic to differentiate the two sets of numbers. I also like that it detects VOCs as well as particulates and the auto mode seemed to read the room accurately. The air coming out of the fan did indeed feel cool, though at first had a strong plastic odor. Unfortunately, it was the lowest performing unit during two separate burn tests and had repeated connectivity issues.</p>

It and the app have that Instagrammable, muted-modern look that countless clothing and bedsheet brands emulate these days. That style doesn’t come cheap as the Air Pro costs over $1,000 and requires $140 filters. The company came under fire for and had to stop making many of its <a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/molekule-retracts-most-of-its-advertising-claims/">claims</a> about its filtration system, which may have led to it filing for <a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://investors.molekule.com/static-files/f840066a-d3f6-456f-b6f1-c5f3f2aa9a8c">bankruptcy</a> in 2023. Molekule is still able to tout its patented photoelectrochemical oxidation, which the company says destroys pollutants at a “molecular level.” In my tests, it performed almost as well as the others in improving VOC and PM2.5 levels. But it’s also very loud: When auto mode kicked the fan into high gear, it would make me tense. Also, I found the unit often indicated “bad” or “very bad” levels when my two monitors indicated the air quality was actually pretty good.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-air-purifier-faqs">Air purifier FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-settings-should-you-run-an-air-purifier-on"><strong>What settings should you run an air purifier on?</strong></h3> 
<p>There aren’t many settings to adjust on an air purifier. Most have low, medium and high fan speeds and possibly an auto-mode that detects impurities in the air and increases the fan speed on your behalf. Air circulates through a purifier faster at higher fan-speed settings so it cleans the air more efficiently. Higher speeds also make the air purifier louder. That means you typically want to find the balance between cleaning power and noise levels.</p> 
<p>Other settings like timers and dimming the LED lights make the unit more comfortable to live with, particularly if you use yours in your bedroom. For everyday cleaning of the air, you’re probably best off leaving the air purifier running on low, only kicking it up to high at certain times when the air is murkier, like after you cook.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-hepa-filter"><strong>What is a HEPA filter?</strong></h3> 
<p>A HEPA filter is a type of particle filter. Every air purifier has a particle filter, but not all are considered “true HEPA” filters. The <a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.standards.doe.gov/standards-documents/3000/3020-astd-2015">specifications</a> are determined by the US Department of Energy and require a minimum efficiency of 99.97 percent when filtering airborne particles of 0.3 microns. HEPA filters can remove dust, pollen, mold and bacteria.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">budgeting app</a>. There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50.</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can&#39;t be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can&#39;t redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="68e3d4298a9545d590aa7cc3d90be63d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarchmoney.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you&#39;ll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you&#39;ve set. There&#39;s also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what&#39;s been happening with your money that month. You&#39;ll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it&#39;s a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven&#39;t yet found a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint replacement</a>.

Some people swear by to-do lists and apps, some people like scheduling and planners. For those in the latter camp, Google has made a minor but valuable <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/11/block-time-for-tasks-google-calendar.html">addition</a> to the Workspace suite. Going forward, you&#39;ll be able to block off segments of time in Google Calendar for working on specific tasks. You can add descriptions and set your preferences for that task in regard to do not disturb and visibility settings. It&#39;s a nice step up from scheduling meetings with yourself when you have to focus on a particular assignment (which several of us at <em>Engadget</em> have been known to do).</p>

Once it’s fully rolled out, it will be available by default, whether you&#39;re a Google Workspaces customer or just using a personal Google account.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Creators on Facebook and Instagram have long griped about accounts that lift their videos without permission. Now, Meta is rolling out a new tool that allows creators to more easily track when their videos have been reposted by others.</p><p>The company introduced a new tool for creators called &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://creators.facebook.com/blog/content-protection-your-new-creative-guardian-on-facebook" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">content protection</a>,&quot; which can automatically detect when a creator&#39;s original reel is reposted, either fully or partially, on Facebook or Instagram. Creators who are enrolled will be able to see which accounts have shared their work and will be able to take a range of actions on the clip.&nbsp;</p><p>Available actions include &quot;track,&quot; which allows the creator to add a label indicating the clip originally came from their account. In addition to the link back, creators will also be able to keep tabs on the number of views it&#39;s getting. Creators can also opt to block a clip entirely, which will prevent anyone else from being able to view the reel. (Meta notes choosing this option won&#39;t impose additional penalties on the account that lifted the original content.) Finally, creators can choose to &quot;release&quot; the video, which removes it from their dashboard so they will no longer have any visibility into how it&#39;s performing.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fb_content_protection_dash.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/fb_content_protection_dash.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="The dashboard tracks instances of reused content," data-uuid="99bed90f-1339-43f8-8980-675ef1858ea0"><figcaption>The dashboard tracks instances of reused content,</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>The dashboard also provides some other details that could help creators decide how to respond. For example, they can see whether the video using their content is being monetized, which may influence their decision to track with attribution or block entirely. On the other hand, if a reel was lifted from an account with few followers, they may opt to simply keep an eye on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta has already offered Facebook creators some of these abilities in the past through its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://creators.facebook.com/tools/rights-manager/?locale=en_US" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">rights manager</a> platform, but the company says making the features available directly in the Facebook app will make it accessible to more people. Notably, the company is only offering content protection to creators who share reels on Facebook. So even though the feature will detect copycats on Instagram, it will only do so if the original video has been posted to Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta says content protection is rolling out now to creators in its monetization program &quot;who meet enhanced integrity and originality standards&quot; as well as those already using rights manager. Creators can also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/rights_manager/apply" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">apply</a> for access directly.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-rolls-out-new-tools-for-creators-to-track-accounts-stealing-their-content-201020255.html?src=rss]]></description>

It&#39;ll be available for streaming on the platform&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox">official YouTube page</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch page</a>.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know how long this stream will run for, but previous Partner Preview events have <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-hosting-a-partner-showcase-on-october-17-at-1pm-et-174034491.html">lasted around 25 to 30 minutes</a>. As indicated by the name, this stream will highlight third-party publishers. Xbox called out companies like THQ Nordic, Tencent and IO Interactive in the press release that announced the event.</p>

<p>We do know some games that&#39;ll be getting the spotlight this week. Xbox has stated that we&#39;ll be seeing &quot;an exciting first look&quot; at content coming to the James Bond game, <em>007 First Light</em>. IO Interactive is behind that one and it <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/007-first-light-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-nintendo-switch-2-and-pc-on-march-27-191011686.html">comes out on March 27</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We got to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/007-first-light-hitman-meets-action-movie-183551755.html">watch this title in action</a> at Gamescom and called it &quot;Hitman meets action blockbuster.&quot; This is appropriate given that developer IO Interactive was behind many of the Hitman games.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll also be getting an &quot;electrifying extended gameplay trailer&quot; for <em>Tides of Annihilation</em>. This is an upcoming fantasy adventure game made by the Chinese studio Eclipse Glow Games. The platform also promises a &quot;fresh look&quot; at <em>Reanimal</em>, which is a horror adventure from the folks behind <em>Little Nightmares</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla has secured a ruling to strip a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-13-tesla-lawsuit-claiming-racist-work-environment.html"><ins>2017 lawsuit</ins></a> claiming a racist work environment of its class-action status, as reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/tesla-wins-bid-undo-race-bias-class-action-by-black-factory-workers-2025-11-17/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. California Superior Court Judge Peter Borkon, appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021, ruled that the lawsuit could not proceed with class-action status because the plaintiffs&#39; attorneys had failed to find 200 class members willing to testify. The judge said he could not assume that the experiences of a select group of workers could be applied to the entire class of would-be plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The 2017 lawsuit began with a single employee who filed suit alleging Tesla&#39;s Fremont production floor was a &quot;hotbed for racist behavior,&quot; and that over 100 employees had experienced racial harassment.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 2024, a lower court judge ruled the case could move forward as a class action, a decision that Tesla had been appealing since. A trial in the case was scheduled to begin in April, though now that the case has lost its class-action status, each plaintiff would have to bring their case against Tesla separately.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Tesla has found itself in court over alleged racial misconduct. In 2023, the automaker <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sued-by-federal-agency-for-racial-harassment-at-california-factory-053220563.html"><ins>was sued</ins></a> by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over allegations that Black employees were subjected to racial slurs and retaliation.</p>
<p>Last year, Tesla <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-settles-long-running-racial-discrimination-court-battle-with-former-worker-133036456.html"><ins>reached a confidential settlement</ins></a> with a single employee who said he faced discrimination at the same California plant, reporting that his coworkers left drawings of swastikas and racist figures on his workspace.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-wins-bid-to-decertify-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-racial-discrimination-191256294.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s DeepMind <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weathernext-2/"><ins>just released WeatherNext 2</ins></a>, a new version of its AI weather prediction model. The company promises that it &quot;delivers more efficient, more accurate and higher-resolution global weather predictions.&quot; To that end, it should be able to provide accurate forecasts up to two weeks out, including information on temperature, pressure and wind.</p>
<p>It should also be able to better predict tropical storm tracks, according to researchers. This means that predictions of a hurricane&#39;s path should be accurate up to three days out. The previous model only predicted things up to two days ahead of the storm.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6548f2e5c8ed48ef8e1131015def7352"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQwqoEm_xis?si=QOP2rkhZeqGp3GOB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The model also brings hourly forecasts into the mix. All told, Google says this new model is eight times faster than the previous iteration. This should help businesses like energy traders make more precise decisions, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-17/deepmind-s-latest-ai-weather-model-targets-energy-traders"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>&quot;It gives you a more granular forecast,&quot; DeepMind AI researcher Akib Uddin said. &quot;Many other industries are quite interested in these one-hour steps. It helps them make more precise decisions. Their goal is, how can they make their business more resilient to weather?&quot;</p>

<p>The improvements here stem from a new approach to weather models, as explained in this <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10772"><ins>recently-published research paper</ins></a>. Older methods demanded the use of machine learning models that were built for image and video generation. This required repeated processing to ensure an accurate result. The new model only requires a single processing step, which also reduces reliance on costly AI computing systems.</p>
<p>AI may not be <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-may-power-siri-with-anthropic-or-openai-models-amid-ai-struggles-212028351.html"><ins>great at everything</ins></a>, despite what proponents want you to believe, but it is <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepminds-gencast-ai-is-really-good-at-forecasting-the-weather-184751414.html"><ins>great at predicting the weather</ins></a>. Newer models typically <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-is-starting-to-outperform-meteorologists-173616631.html"><ins>outperform traditional prediction methods</ins></a>, even those that rely on supercomputers.</p>
<p>These models aren&#39;t perfect, however, as even Google has acknowledged that WeatherNext 2 will likely struggle to predict outlier rain and snow events. This is due to gaps in the training data. &quot;It’s one limitation of our forecast, but one that we are working on improving,” DeepMind research scientist Ferran Alet told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234">Proton VPN</a> is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you&#39;d save $180.</p>

<p>Proton VPN is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPN overall</a> because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html">might not be fast enough</a> for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service&#39;s library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.</p>
<p>The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it&#39;s easy to find a feature or setting you&#39;re looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you&#39;re connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most importantly, though, it&#39;s Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There&#39;s a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton&#39;s servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.</p>
<p>Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html">VPN deal</a> this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to Proton VPN.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.</p></li>

The beta for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/flight-deals-is-googles-new-ai-powered-travel-search-tool-161502688.html">Flight Deals</a>, the AI-powered search tool that operates within Google Flights, is expanding globally. The tool works to find the best deals on flights in response to natural-language prompts from the user. The company is also expanding AI Mode&#39;s agentic capabilities to more users across the US, helping to book restaurants, event tickets and beauty or wellness appointments.</p>
<p>The search giant is also adding a new feature to AI Mode called Canvas. This tool offers an organized space for users to build plans or projects. It can also help plan trips. Within the Canvas environment, users can describe the kind of trip they want to book, and the various tools will suggest destinations, hotels and bookings.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta and Google are facing delays with long-promised undersea cable projects, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-17/google-meta-delay-red-sea-cables-as-security-risks-rattle-plans"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. A Meta spokesperson blames the delays on a &quot;range of operational factors, regulatory concerns and geopolitical risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Meta&#39;s 2Africa subsea cable system is supposed to wrap around the African continent to deliver fiber internet to the region. It&#39;s also intended to connect Europe with Asia and Africa. The 28,000-mile project was first announced all the way back in 2020.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6d2568fd5e9845d98d09c3c251ef7d5d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interesting: Meta is one of the largest investors in 2Africa, the largest subsea fibre optic cable system ever:<a href="https://t.co/sNWd8SoYUZ">https://t.co/sNWd8SoYUZ</a><br><br>Meta’s subsea cable investments are expected to contribute over half a trillion dollars to Asia-Pacific and European economies by 2025.… <a href="https://t.co/gVuuztqhd7">pic.twitter.com/gVuuztqhd7</a></p>— Jack Prescott (@JackPrescottX) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPrescottX/status/1842640812217393194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>However, the company has experienced issues when running cable through the southern portion of the Red Sea. A whole section has yet to be built due to regional conflicts and difficulty obtaining certain permits from local governments.</p>
<p>The Google-backed Blue-Raman intercontinental cable system has also been delayed in the region, after first being announced in 2021. This system was originally supposed to go live in 2024, connecting countries like France, Italy, India, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Oman. The company has not provided an updated timetable.</p>
<p>These are just two examples, as plenty of other fiber internet cables have yet to go live in the Red Sea. Builders have experienced repeated missile attacks, allegedly by the Iran-backed Houthis, which forced them on lengthy detours and disrupted work.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not only unable to monetize their investments by sending data over these cables, but they are forced to purchase capacity on alternative cables to meet their near-term requirements,&quot; said Alan Mauldin, research director at telecommunications firm Telegeography.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that these delays shouldn&#39;t impact two previously announced undersea fiber projects by Google and Meta. Google is building a cable to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/undersea-google-internet-cable-will-connect-togo-to-europe-225436327.html"><ins>connect Togo to Europe</ins></a>, which will wrap around the Atlantic side. Meta is building a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-confirms-its-building-its-own-subsea-cable-190153227.html"><ins>gigantic cable system</ins></a> that looks to connect five continents, which isn&#39;t crossing the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Undersea cables are a great way to give the various regions of the world fiber internet, but there are some downsides. We&#39;ve already covered geopolitical concerns when it comes to building, but the installed cables can tear and break.

<p>In iRobot&#39;s lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot&#39;s other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">favorite budget robot vacuum</a>, and you&#39;ll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it&#39;s down charging.</p> 
<p>This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results">its last earning statement</a>. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac&#39;s offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/pick-up-this-entry-level-roomba-robot-vacuum-for-only-150-for-black-friday-191506087.html?src=rss]]></description>
