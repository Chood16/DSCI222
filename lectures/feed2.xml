                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been on the fence about trying the sort of “AR glasses” that, until recently, were called “personal cinemas,” then check this out. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Xreal</a> has turned up to CES 2026 with an updated version of its entry level <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-new-one-series-ar-glasses-use-usb-c-to-connect-with-nearly-any-device-191221387.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Xreal One glasses</a>, first launched at the end of 2024. The new model, dubbed the 1S (yes, with a numeral rather than the word) gets marginally better specs and $50 knocked from the asking price.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, One is a wearable spatial display that connects over USB-C to any compatible device including smartphones, tablets, laptops and consoles. It has two teeny-tiny displays in the eyecups that, when worn close to the eyes, trick your brain into thinking you’re looking at a big screen. The average would measure in at around 171 inches, but it’s possible to push the view to a screen closer to 500 inches if your eyes are capable of focusing that far.</p>
<p>As for the changes, they’re all firmly in the welcome nip-and-tuck department, boosting many of the original’s key specs. For instance, the 1080p screens have been swapped out for 1200p full HD, while the field of view has gone from 50 degrees to 52. Brightness has been boosted from 600 nits on the old model to 700 nits here, while the aspect ratio has grown from 16x9 to 16x10. But the change Xreal is arguably most proud of is the drop in price, from $499 down to $449.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company is launching the Xreal Neo, an external battery-cum-DisplayPort hub for your glasses. Inside you’ll find a 10,000mAh power bank to keep your glasses going for longer and, more importantly, offers better connection for your Switch consoles. After all, before now, if you wanted to play with your Switch or Switch 2, you’d need to hook it up to its own dock. With the Neo, however, you can eliminate that from your bag when you’re playing out and about. That’s available as a standalone purchase for $99 which, like the new 1S, are ready to buy right now.</p>

<p>We&#39;re just hours away from the start of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html">CES 2026</a>, and with that comes <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html">Intel&#39;s launch event</a>. The chip giant is expected to provide more details on its AI PC initiative and the new processors powering it: The Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs (aka Panther Lake) are made using an 18A process — that&#39;s 18 <em>angstroms</em>, or just under 2nm — and designed for <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-its-panther-lake-core-ultra-chips-130010879.html">high-end laptops and gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>For Intel, the stakes at CES are higher than ever. In the past 12 months, both <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/nvidia-throws-intel-a-5-billion-lifeline-to-build-pc-and-data-center-cpus-122030186.html">NVIDIA</a> and the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-government-is-taking-an-89-billion-stake-in-intel-205047795.html">US government</a> acquired ownership stakes in the company, helping nearly double the stock price by the end of the year. But that&#39;s still down over more than 20 percent since 2021, as rivals like TSMC, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA have taken the leadership mantle in chip fabrication and AI hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-intels-launch-event">How to watch Intel&#39;s launch event</h2>
<p>Senior VP of Intel&#39;s Client Computing Group Jim Johnson will kick off the launch event on Monday, January 5 at 6PM ET. A livestream will be available on the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@IntelNewsroom/featured">Intel Newsroom YouTube channel</a>, which we&#39;ll post here when it&#39;s live.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect from Intel at CES 2026</h2>
<p>As we noted above, Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be highlighting &quot;the next generation of Intel-powered PCs, edge solution, and the AI experiences enabled by the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors.&quot; We&#39;ll be keen to hear if the company can address the profitability concerns that have surrounded those next-gen chips since at least last summer, when <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intel-struggles-with-key-manufacturing-process-next-pc-chip-sources-say-2025-08-05/">published reports</a> indicated that yields were still under 50 percent. (In response, Intel <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intels-next-gen-manufacturing-process-is-reportedly-still-struggling-184146350.html">told Engadget</a> that it felt &quot;very good&quot; about its trajectory on Panther Lake, though it didn&#39;t hit the late 2025 release date it had envisioned at the time.)</p>
<p>Will we get any updates on that NVIDIA partnership? It&#39;s possible. But don&#39;t expect to hear anything about <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-could-return-to-using-intel-chips-in-2027">Intel possibly fabricating the chips</a> for that rumored new entry-level MacBook Air. If that comes to pass, the announcement will definitely be at a time and place of Apple&#39;s choosing.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-intel-ces-2026-launch-event-130040089.html?src=rss]]></description>

That includes two ceiling lights (one of which simulates a skylight) and a floor lamp that supports trillions of colors.</p><p>Govee describes the new Ceiling Light Ultra as &quot;the industry&#39;s first ceiling light designed as a true creative canvas.&quot; It uses 616 individually controlled LEDs (the highest in its class, according to Govee) to provide that level of detail. Using the Govee app, you can design visuals for it &quot;with up to eight distinct layers of motion, color and shapes.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Celling_Light_Ultra_2.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Celling_Light_Ultra_2.jpg" style="height:2250px;width:4000px;" alt="Product marketing photo.

The company says it emulates natural skylights &quot;with high accuracy.&quot; (However, it&#39;s also less flexible than the Ultra, with far fewer individually controlled LEDs.) You can also use it as a more traditional white-light fixture, and Govee says it&#39;s good for spaces are large as 300 square feet.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/govee.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/govee.jpg" style="height:858px;width:1525px;" alt="Product lifestyle marketing image.

Polo</a>. The German automaker unveiled the interior of its upcoming compact EV, which features real buttons, switches and even a knob for audio controls.</p>
<p>&quot;We have created an interior that feels like a friend from the very first contact,&quot; Volkswagen&#39;s chief designer, Andreas Mindt, said in a press release. &quot;Clear physical buttons provide stability and trust, warm materials make it appealing, and charming details such as the new retro views of the instruments show the typical Volkswagen wink.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c5f02030-e8d2-11f0-89d6-5695db5b245e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c5f02030-e8d2-11f0-89d6-5695db5b245e" style="height:921px;width:1795px;" alt="Full view of the Volkswagen ID. Polo&#39;s dashboard" data-uuid="9cfcee69-d7d8-38a3-99bd-d6a4c792118c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure>
<p>Last year, Mindt told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-reintroducing-physical-controls-vital-functions"><em>Autocar</em></a> that Volkswagen would commit to reintroducing physical buttons for the most important functions &quot;in every car we make from now on,&quot; starting with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vws-id2all-compact-ev-will-cost-under-25000-when-it-arrives-in-2025-194635462.html">ID. 2all concept car</a> that has since evolved to become the ID. Polo. The EV maker backed up those claims since the ID. Polo will feature tangible buttons underneath the infotainment display, along with a steering wheel that&#39;s packed with even more clear buttons. Between the driver and passenger, Volkswagen even included a knob that can adjust audio volume or shuffle between tracks and radio stations.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/250a3ed0-e8d2-11f0-baba-01ef6281faa0" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/250a3ed0-e8d2-11f0-baba-01ef6281faa0" style="height:2296px;width:3437px;" alt="Volkswagen&#39;s " data-uuid="295e7243-3c1c-382c-93b5-ad92797e97b4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure>
<p>Besides the renewed emphasis on physical controls, Volkswagen still included a 10.25-inch digital cockpit behind the steering wheel. In the center, there&#39;s a nearly 13-inch touchscreen that serves as the infotainment system. For a retro throwback, the ID. Polo can swap its cockpit display to one that&#39;s inspired by the classic Golf I from the 1980s through a button on its steering wheel or with the infotainment touchscreen.</p>
<p>The ID.

<p>CES has long felt like a full-on auto show, but the car-centric energy seems somewhat muted at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">CES 2026</a>. Sure, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html">Afeela electric vehicle</a> from the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html">Sony-Honda joint venture</a> is returning to the show floor, but with the Trump administration <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html">yanking most EV incentives</a> from the market, the industry isn&#39;t offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there&#39;s no shortage of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2026/holographic-windshield-display/">Holographic Windshield Display</a><a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">. </a></p>
<p>Indeed, the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-mobis-to-unveil-30-new-technologies-at-ces-2026-aiming-to-strengthen-global-oem-partnerships-302635135.html">Mobis subsidiary</a> will present &quot;more than 30 mobility convergence technologies&quot; during CES. And we&#39;ll also get to see Hyundai&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001093">AI Robotics Strategy</a>, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-hyundais-presentation-at-ces-2026">How to watch Hyundai&#39;s presentation at CES 2026</h2>
<p>Hyundai&#39;s presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@hyundai/streams">HyundaiUSA YouTube channel</a> or its <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HyundaiMotorGroup">global YouTube channel</a>. We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It&#39;s essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle&#39;s dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver&#39;s view. It&#39;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.</p>
<p>Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &quot;world&#39;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&quot; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#39;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.</p>
<p>Beyond automotive, though, we&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-acquires-boston-dynamics-1-1-billion-110901223.html">purchased by the Korean multinational</a> back in 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,&quot; the company said in the same press release.</p>
<p>Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051072.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Californians can now put a stop to their personal data being sold around on an online trading floor, thanks to a new free tool. On January 1, the state launched its Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, shortened to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/">DROP</a>, that allows residents to request to delete all of their personal information online that&#39;s been harvested by data brokers.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/californias-new-law-makes-it-easier-for-consumers-to-request-the-deletion-of-their-data-095555419.html">California Privacy Protection Agency</a> (CalPrivacy), which was responsible for DROP&#39;s release, it&#39;s a &quot;first of its kind&quot; tool that imposes new restrictions on businesses that hoard and sell personal info that consumers didn&#39;t provide directly. The process requires verifying your California residency before you can send a &quot;single deletion request to every registered data broker in California.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the other end, CalPrivacy will require <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/house-passes-bill-that-would-bar-data-brokers-from-selling-americans-personal-information-to-adversary-countries-004735748.html">data brokers</a> to register every year and to process any deletion requests from DROP. Data brokers will also have to report the type of information they collect and share, while also being subject to regular audits that check for compliance. If any data broker is found skirting the requirements, they could face penalties and fines.</p>
<p>Besides being the first in the country to offer this type of comprehensive tool that deletes online personal data, CalPrivacy said it&#39;s one of four states, including Oregon, Texas and Vermont, to require data broker registration. According to the agency, data brokers will start processing the first deletion requests from DROP starting August 1, 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/california-introduces-a-one-stop-shop-to-delete-your-online-data-footprint-173102064.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.</p><p>More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.</p><h2 id="cbc11c13-20f0-4f78-bd1e-8f9d8de8b7b3">The CES 2026 schedule</h2><p>Press conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://exhibitors.ces.tech/8_0/#/" data-i13n="slk:a searchable directory;cpos:1;pos:1">a searchable directory</a> of who will have an official presence at the show, along with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ces.tech/schedule/" data-i13n="slk:a schedule;cpos:2;pos:1">a schedule</a> of every official panel and presentation. However, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ces.tech/media-guides/media-days/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">press conference schedule</a> gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. </p><p>On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look" data-i13n="slk:&quot;The First Look,&quot;;cpos:4;pos:1">"The First Look,"</a> a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's "vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences."&nbsp;Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details).  Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. </p><p>That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;linkText=%22Innovation+in+Tune+with+You%2C%22&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vc2cvYWJvdXQtbGcvcHJlc3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2xnLXRvLXNob3djYXNlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW4tdHVuZS13aXRoLXlvdS1hdC1jZXMtMjAyNi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI2NDVhYjQwLTIwYjEtNGNmMC1iZGNmLTllOTY1NmM3OTA2MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3NnL2Fib3V0LWxnL3ByZXNzLWFuZC1tZWRpYS9sZy10by1zaG93Y2FzZS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLXR1bmUtd2l0aC15b3UtYXQtY2VzLTIwMjYvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVdFbvagfuLjdXSTGikLKfxv5Lxz8K374JXMuW2mYP05&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fsg%2Fabout-lg%2Fpress-and-media%2Flg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LG Electronics;elmt:;slk:&quot;Innovation in Tune with You&quot;;cpos:5;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.lg.com/sg/about-lg/press-and-media/lg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026/">"Innovation in Tune with You,"</a> is ostensibly to share "its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence." But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. </p><p>Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Hisense</a>, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130005307.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Lego</a>.

Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. </p><p>Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Core Ultra Series 3 processors</a>, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html" data-i13n="slk:a keynote;cpos:10;pos:1">a keynote</a> address that closes out the day.

It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. </p><h2 id="3a5e935e-daac-4c69-bf38-d7463d8361d0">Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicity</h2><p>As noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might recognize Bosch as a home appliance name (thanks to its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational brand&#39;s core business is really about providing the underlying technology and engineering that powers cars, homes and factories around the world. That focus is reflected at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html">CES 2026</a>, where much of what Bosch is unveiling is intended to be licensed to other companies rather than sold as Bosch-branded products on store shelves.</p>
<p>Case in point is Bosch&#39;s automotive plans at CES. The company is showcasing what it calls &quot;AI in the car,&quot; or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. &quot;Bosch&#39;s AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants,&quot; Bosch board member Markus Heyn <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ai-in-the-car-bosch-presents-cockpit-innovations-at-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-280272.html">said in a press release</a>. We&#39;ll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch-boschs-ces-2026-presentation">How to watch Bosch&#39;s CES 2026 presentation</h2>
<p>You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ces-2026-livestream.html">Bosch press page</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzDeUHM8eik">YouTube</a>.

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/ces-2026/#what-to-expect">three big themes</a> — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.</p>
<p>Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &quot;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The price for a PS4 copy of  the relatively obscure Star Wars racing game, <em>Star Wars Racer Revenge</em>, has dramatically increased in the last few days because of the game’s use in the latest PlayStation 5 jailbreak, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-jail-break-star-wars-racer-revenge" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Eurogamer</em> reports</a>. The PS2 game was originally released in 2002, and was ported to PS4 by Limited Run Games <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://limitedrungames.com/blogs/news/hone-your-podracing-skills-in-star-wars-racer-revenge" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in 2019</a>. Its role as a key ingredient in the jailbreaking process <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">was announced</a> on December 31.</p><p>Interested jailbreakers need <em>Racer Revenge</em> to jailbreak PS5 12.00 firmware because of a bug in the game&#39;s Hall of Fame feature, according to <em>Eurogamer</em>. The bug makes it possible to inject new code into Sony&#39;s console, and because the PS5 is able to load and play PS4 discs, <em>Star Wars Racer Revenge </em>is an easier method to pull the jailbreak off. Retail releases of games are a common way to execute exploits and hacks because, unlike digital copies, they can’t be directly patched.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxim4wOtrlw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>While the PS4 version of <em>Star Wars Racer Revenge</em> was available for anywhere between <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/limited-run-290-star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">$14.99</a> to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/limited-run-290-star-wars-racer-revenge-premium-edition-ps4" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">$37.50</a> when it went on sale originally, used copies are currently listed for as high as $411 <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5a36d98f-e3c9-4ccc-96f8-f261b8484c73&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ef903ed8-28dd-49c4-af49-009dde354f12&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=eBay&amp;linkText=on+eBay&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYmF5LmNvbS9zY2gvaS5odG1sP19ua3c9c3Rhcit3YXJzK3JhY2VyK3JldmVuZ2UrcHM0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZjkwM2VkOC0yOGRkLTQ5YzQtYWY0OS0wMDlkZGUzNTRmMTIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmViYXkuY29tL3NjaC9pLmh0bWw_X25rdz1zdGFyK3dhcnMrcmFjZXIrcmV2ZW5nZStwczQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARZpFiZnYcgSgN9U9tTUARfBrdPbYJqVuntK1lqsUl4P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3Dstar%2Bwars%2Bracer%2Brevenge%2Bps4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:eBay;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=star+wars+racer+revenge+ps4">on eBay</a>.

The early days of January are a great time to grab a last-minute subscription for yourself or a loved one.

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Plenty of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running end-of-year deals that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.</p>

This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.</p>

With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

<p>Samsung is arguably the 800-pound gorilla of CES, with a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators, AI assistants and rolling robots. But for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1766177037453611&amp;usg=AOvVaw2s0tafHDwWnqYKUQHC4zuC">CES 2026</a>, the company is switching things up a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping hints about what&#39;s on the agenda, but what we&#39;re really hoping to see is an update on the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html">Ballie robot</a> — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html">2025 release date</a>.</p>

<p>The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">Samsung Newsroom</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung">Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel</a> or via Samsung TV Plus. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect-from-samsung-at-ces-2026">What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026</h2>
<p>Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &quot;new AI-driven customer experiences,&quot; the company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look">said in a press release</a>. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &quot;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&quot;</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its &quot;Advent calendar&quot; approach to early CES announcements, with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">new press releases</a> dropping nearly every day. So far, we know that — like competitors <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html">LG</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html">Hisense</a> — the company will be offering details on a line of <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">micro RGB TVs</a> (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-new-ai-connected-living-lineup-at-ces-2026">Bespoke AI</a>. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html">Music Studio 5 and 7</a>, at CES this year. Additionally, it&#39;ll debut its latest <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html">Freestyle+ portable projector</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html">Odyssey gaming monitor</a>. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen <em>and</em> has glasses-free 3D. It&#39;s likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models.</p>
<p>Samsung will likely continue to map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we&#39;ll keep updating this story as it does.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-on-sunday-190027889.html?src=rss]]></description>

Inside the fridge, GE also includes a flush-mount LED bar with a built-in camera that can deliver &quot;real-time, on-demand snapshots of crisper drawers, focusing on the most costly and perishable items.&quot; This &quot;FridgeFocus&quot; feature is supposed to prevent you from overbuying perishable produce that you might already have, by letting you see which perishables might go bad first.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Profile_SmartFridge_1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Profile_SmartFridge_1.jpg" style="height:2500px;width:2400px;" alt="A silver four door refrigerator nestled in wooden shelves." data-uuid="e2f6db31-934c-4b98-af4f-87163e27af80"/><figcaption>GE&#39;s fridge is stainless steel and has a built-in touchscreen display.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>On top of those smart features, the GE Profile Smart Refrigerator has a four-door stainless steel design, with door-in-door storage and an adjustable temperature drawer. The fridge also has an 8-inch touchscreen display for viewing recipes or the current weather conditions, and microphones for accepting voice commands. When you&#39;re dispensing water, the fridge&#39;s water dispenser is supposed to be smart enough to fill a container with the exact right amount of water using built-in sensors, too.</p><p>The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant will be available from GE and select retailers starting in April 2026 for a suggested MSRP of $4,899.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ges-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326610.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>For years, LG has opened CES press day with the first event of the morning — and 2026 will be no exception.

<p>While AMD says it&#39;s keeping its product details <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html"><ins>under wraps</ins></a>, we can expect &quot;updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the &quot;advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.&quot; That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever"><ins>better single-threaded performance</ins></a>. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture.</p>

It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="feed13a4ff304bf1a5611d4015f6cd38" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNVCQZG1?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch.</p> 
<p>This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go.</p> 
<p>The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clicks is bringing its physical keyboard products to CES yet again, and these are chock full of nostalgia. The company has also unveiled its first smartphone, aimed at &quot;communication, not consumption,&quot; that it says will function as a second phone used mostly for messaging.</p>
<p>The phone is dubbed the Clicks Communicator and features a tactile keyboard, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. The interface is built on Android 16 and supports hardware-level encryption.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even though Clicks says it wants to leave &quot;content capture&quot; to a users&#39; primary device, the Communicator still sports a 50MP main camera and 24MP front camera. The phone also has NFC to support Google Pay, along with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capability. Its 4,000 mAh battery can be charged via USB-C or wireless charging.</p>
<p>While the Communicator may look like a Blackberry or Palm device from days gone by, it carries modern features like a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar. It also has what Clicks calls a Signal LED, which is a customizable alert light that lets users know when specific people or apps are causing notifications.</p>
<p>As much as Clicks talks about its new phone as a secondary device, it follows the trend of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/minimal-phone-pioneer-punkt-is-back-with-a-new-privacy-focused-model-at-ces-110000705.html"><ins>minimalist</ins></a> or &quot;dumb&quot; phones as more users pull away from an overexposure to technology, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-says-that-social-media-like-cigarettes-should-come-with-warning-labels-171005572.html"><ins>social media</ins></a> and notifications. Some might even find it compelling as a primary device. But the secondary device idea feels unproven: having two phones would mean two phone plans with two phone numbers, which could be impractical for many users. The Communicator can be <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.clicksphone.com/communicator"><ins>reserved now</ins></a> for $399 and will increase to $499 on February 27.</p>
<p>For users wanting a tactile keyboard to use with standard smartphones, Clicks has made the Power Keyboard. It features a QWERTY layout with directional keys and a number row. It attaches via MagSafe or Qi2 and has a 2,150 mAh battery to help keep your phone topped up. The phone can then be flipped into either a horizontal or vertical orientation, which ends up resembling a T-Mobile Sidekick.</p>

<p>Hisense is typically best known for its affordable electronics and home appliances, from TVs to refrigerators. But at CES 2025, the China-based company showed off its premium side with a massive 136-inch micro LED TV — now available for a jaw-dropping <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9486b306-eae4-49da-a805-9b5cf78d2fb9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;linkText=%24100%2C000&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXN0YnV5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2hpc2Vuc2UtMTM2LWNsYXNzLW14LW1pY3JvLWxlZC1zZXJpZXMtdWhkLTRrLXZpZGFhLXR2LXNtYXJ0LWRpc3BsYXktMjAyNS9KM1o5WjQyNjlZIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NDg2YjMwNi1lYWU0LTQ5ZGEtYTgwNS05YjVjZjc4ZDJmYjkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc3RidXkuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QvaGlzZW5zZS0xMzYtY2xhc3MtbXgtbWljcm8tbGVkLXNlcmllcy11aGQtNGstdmlkYWEtdHYtc21hcnQtZGlzcGxheS0yMDI1L0ozWjlaNDI2OVkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ89t0paqxpwATdjqp9az6PvRx_kS7XVPyg75kpghW87&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fhisense-136-class-mx-micro-led-series-uhd-4k-vidaa-tv-smart-display-2025%2FJ3Z9Z4269Y" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/hisense-136-class-mx-micro-led-series-uhd-4k-vidaa-tv-smart-display-2025/J3Z9Z4269Y">$100,000</a>. So what&#39;s in store for this year&#39;s show? New leadership, for starters.</p>
<p>The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-to-appoint-james-fishler-to-c-suite-as-the-company-strengthens-its-u-s-strategy-ahead-o">press release</a>, Hisense said Fishler&#39;s experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company &quot;builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense&#39;s presentation and how you can watch it live.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-watch">How to watch Hisense&#39;s presentation</h2>
<p>Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/ces-2026">its website</a>. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/exclusive-hisense-is-betting-on-rgb-tvs-to-shake-up-the-industry-and-make-rivals-nervous">Tom&#39;s Guide</a>, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.</p>
<p>As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html">Samsung</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html">LG</a> have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-jan-5-190040858.html?src=rss]]></description>

The first event of the year, Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), kicks off on Sunday, January 4, with <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>.

<p>The Lego Group is set to host its very first press conference at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html">CES 2026</a> — but exactly what it plans to unveil is still under wraps. The iconic toy brick maker has offered no clues about what&#39;s on the agenda, leaving speculation wide open, from new video games to Formula 1 race cars.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how you can watch Lego&#39;s presentation at CES, along with what we think the company could reveal.</p>

<p>The Lego CES press conference is scheduled for Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET. While Lego and the Consumer Technology Association haven&#39;t yet provided the details, we expect that the press conference will be available as a livestream. Once the details are confirmed, we&#39;ll update this post to confirm them. But if a livestream isn&#39;t immediately available, the Engadget team will be liveblogging the Lego presser and posting timely details.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>Thus far, Lego hasn&#39;t shared any public info about its CES plans, so we&#39;re largely in the dark as to what to expect.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG just announced some new Gram AI laptops <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-everything-we-expect-at-ces-2026-144657955.html"><ins>ahead of CES 2026</ins></a>. These are incredibly portable laptops that the company says are the &quot;lightest in their class.&quot; This is largely thanks to a proprietary material that LG has dubbed Aerominum.</p>
<p>This material reportedly &quot;reduces the laptop&#39;s weight while reinforcing&quot; structural strength. In other words, these computers are both light and durable. Each model offers improved scratch resistance, while providing a &quot;sleek metallic finish.&quot; The laptops have also been designed to meet military-grade durability standards.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AI in the name refers to the inclusion of Microsoft Copilot+ PC and LG&#39;s on-device system. The laptops should be able to handle some AI tasks without an active internet connection.</p>
<p>These computers can also access LG&#39;s Link technology, which allows file sharing and screen mirroring across multiple devices. This works with smartphones, webOS devices, TVs, monitors and projectors.</p>
<p>There are two new laptops in the refreshed line. The LG gram Pro 17 boasts a 17-inch WQXGA LCD screen. It also comes with the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 GPU. This is being called the &quot;world&#39;s lightest 17-inch laptop.&quot; The LG gram Pro 16 features an OLED display and is powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra processors.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have pricing or availability yet on these. We&#39;ll update this post when we find out.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>During CES 2025, NVIDIA spent much of its keynote touting its leading position in artificial intelligence. Still, the company managed to squeeze in a few notable hardware announcements, including <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-announced-at-its-ces-2025-keynote-174947827.html">its RTX 5000-series GPUs</a> and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidias-spark-desktop-ai-supercomputer-arrives-this-summer-200351998.html">Spark</a>).

<p>But if you won&#39;t be in Vegas for the action, don&#39;t worry. Here&#39;s how you can watch the livestream of the company&#39;s January 5 press conference, and what NVIDIA is expected to unveil at CES this year.</p>

<p>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on Monday, January 5 at 4PM ET via <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NVIDIA;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4a8ad1a0-9035-4f52-a4e0-783ee7c9700b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;linkText=NVIDIA%27s+website&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2V2ZW50cy9jZXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YThhZDFhMC05MDM1LTRmNTItYTRlMC03ODNlZTdjOTcwMGIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm52aWRpYS5jb20vZW4tdXMvZXZlbnRzL2Nlcy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR26TWBottpAVLkSWGEW61EoLzbnApNs7qzQl5JGh6Ef&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fevents%2Fces%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/">NVIDIA&#39;s website</a> (and likely on YouTube as well). We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>NVIDIA&#39;s game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including  &quot;cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.&quot; It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we&#39;re unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.</p>
<p>Given <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-worth-much-german-economy-133045033.html">NVIDIA&#39;s sky-high valuation</a> and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html">increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers</a> — largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang&#39;s remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company&#39;s Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA&#39;s partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang&#39;s presentation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-jan-5-130028279.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Sony&#39;s CES 2026 press conference is just a few days away, and this year comes with a twist: Rather than an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Sound odd? That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. But this year, we&#39;ll get to see an all-new concept model at the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&#39;s now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html">since CES 2020</a>, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html">feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era</a>,&quot; and that &quot;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&quot; Ouch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/">said in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>The company recently announced that the Afeela will be the first vehicle ever to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/">offer PlayStation Remote Play</a>, which lets players stream their PS4 or PS5 games from their consoles remotely while inside the car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what else is new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-monday-130048051.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>You’ve probably heard people say it’s impossible to go back and correct some error from the past. To those people, you should raise a middle finger in defiance (they are miserable, after all), and then point them to the tale of Pebble’s unlikely revival. The smartwatch pioneer’s return <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-founder-eric-migicovsky-just-introduced-two-new-e-paper-smartwatches-160008363.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">was a surprise of 2025</a>, and now the company has resurrected one of its last great triumphs. It’s announcing the Pebble Round 2, and company founder Eric Migicovsky is looking to put right what once went wrong.</p>
<p>The Pebble Round 2 is the successor to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-05-pebble-time-round-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Pebble Time Round</a>, which debuted in 2015 to what can only be described as <em>frustrated</em> reviews. It was a truly thin smartwatch, with a glorious round display, but that came at the cost of battery life and durability. The fancier components also added to the cost which pushed it to an unreasonable-for-the-time $249. It’s these flaws which the company has sought to address with the Round 2, as well as some of the issues that weren’t deal breakers at the time, but certainly weren’t ideal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the massive bezel around the display is now a thing of the past, with the Round 2’s 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen now stretching to the edge of its case. The viewing angles have also been dramatically improved, enabling you to check the time without having to move your wrist. The display has also been bonded to the glass crystal, reducing reflectivity and glare which was another downside for the original model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better still, the battery life is now more than two weeks on a single charge, giving it the sort of Pebble-esque longevity its users demand. And it’s retained that thinness — measuring in at just 8.1mm — which is far more elegant than the chunkier smartwatches from other manufacturers. Plus, there’s dual microphones for interacting with AI agents and dictating messages, as well as step and sleep tracking.</p>
<p>Migicovsky explained that the focus here isn’t just to correct some of the more glaring issues from the first model. As he <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/why-pebble-failed-d7be937c6232" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">wrote</a> back in 2022, Pebble’s failure was down to its attempt to broaden its appeal beyond the users who had so warmly adopted it in the first place. Consequently, rather than include bulky features like a a built-in optical heart-rate sensor, the focus is on utility. Not to mention a desire to reintroduce some much-needed whimsy into hardware, and empowering users to tinker with their devices, enabling them to craft their own watch faces.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we’ll get some time in person with the Pebble Round 2 in the next few days, but in the meantime, it’s up for pre-order from today. It’ll set you back $199, and will begin shipping in May. And if you’ve already put down cash for a Pebble Time 2, and want to change your mind, you can switch your order over, no questions asked.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk&#39;s Grok AI has been allowing users to transform photographs of woman and children into sexualized and compromising images, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/grok-posts-sexual-images-of-minors-after-lapses-in-safeguards?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported. The issue has created an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Xyless/status/2006997214862913863">uproar</a> among users on X and prompted an &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/global-outrage-as-xs-grok-morphs-photos-of-women-children-into-explicit-content-19811130.htm">apology</a>&quot; from the bot itself. &quot;I deeply regret an incident on Dec. 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user&#39;s prompt,&quot; Grok said in a post. An X representative has yet to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>According to the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network, CSAM <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://rainn.org/get-the-facts-about-csam-child-sexual-abuse-material/what-is-csam/">includes</a> &quot;AI-generated content that makes it look like a child is being abused,&quot; as well as &quot;any content that sexualizes or exploits a child for the viewer’s benefit.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Several days ago, users noticed others on the site asking Grok to digitally manipulate photos of women and children into sexualized and abusive content, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/grok-claims-safeguards-tightened-after-users-misuse-ai-to-morph-images-of-women-children-ws-l-19811512.htm"><em>CNBC</em></a>. The images were then distributed on X and other sites without consent, in possible violation of law. &quot;We&#39;ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them,&quot; a response from Grok reads. It added that CSAM is &quot;illegal and prohibited.&quot; Grok is supposed to have features to prevent such abuse, but AI guardrails can often be manipulated by users.</p>
<p>It appears X has yet to reinforced whatever guardrails Grok has to prevent this sort of image generation. However, the company has hidden Grok&#39;s media feature which makes it harder to either find images or document potential abuse. Grok itself <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/grok/status/2007004632455823568">acknowledged</a> that &quot;a company could face criminal or civil penalties if it knowingly facilitates or fails to prevent AI-generated CSAM after being alerted.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Internet Watch Foundation recently <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/reports-indicate-a-massive-uptick-in-ai-generated-csam-throughout-the-internet-154937671.html">revealed</a> that AI-generated CSAM has increased by an increase orders of magnitude in 2025 compared to the year before. This is in part because the language models behind AI generation are accidentally trained on real photos of children scraped from school websites and social media <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The New York Times;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f7de8f88-bd57-4968-b611-403ff1611ccc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=or+even+prior+CSAM+content&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA3LzEwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWktY3NhbS1jaGlsZC1zZXh1YWwtYWJ1c2UuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjdkZThmODgtYmQ1Ny00OTY4LWI2MTEtNDAzZmYxNjExY2NjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA3LzEwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWktY3NhbS1jaGlsZC1zZXh1YWwtYWJ1c2UuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcRTAKYcvRz1Mokh_50k4CVSLImNAlfMs_5VptBwyq11&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F07%2F10%2Ftechnology%2Fai-csam-child-sexual-abuse.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/technology/ai-csam-child-sexual-abuse.html">or even prior CSAM content</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fender Audio, the consumer electronics arm of the instrument maker, will introduce two flagship audio products at this year&#39;s CES in Las Vegas. These products were made under a licensing agreement with Singapore-based company RiffSound.</p>
<p>First up is a line of Bluetooth speakers dubbed the ELIE (Extremely Loud Infinitely Expressive). The lineup includes two models, the E6 and E12. The speakers leverage a combination of DSP and system-on-a-chip processing, which Fender says can deliver more volume while maintaining greater power efficiency.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Each speaker can handle up to four audio channels at once, including a Bluetooth source, a wired XLR or 1/4-inch input and two additional wireless channels with compatible Fender Audio accessories. Users can also sync up two ELIE speakers in a stereo set-up. The announcement was light on specific differences between the E6 and E12, but in images shared with Engadget, the E12 appears larger. We&#39;ll be seeing these in person at CES for a more thorough evaluation.</p>
<p>Fender will also introduce the MIX headphones, a set of modular cans that the company says are designed to adapt to a user&#39;s sound and style preferences. The headphones include a USB-C transmitter that offers lossless, low-latency and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluetooth-auracast-is-everywhere-at-ces-2024-so-what-is-it-224509414.html"><ins>Auracast</ins></a> transmission modes.</p>
<p>The headphones are powered by 40mm graphene drivers and feature active noise cancellation. They work in wired or wireless mode, with up to 100 hours of battery life, according to Fender. The company hasn&#39;t shared much about the modular aspect of these headphones, but we&#39;ll get a closer look at CES. Details on pricing and availability have not been shared.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>After the event has wrapped up, pop singer Gwen Stefani will take the stage to perform.</p>
<p>As for real products, look for Lenovo to build on some of its successful launches from CES 2025. A year ago, we saw the portable <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ces-2025-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld-160001642.html"><ins>Lenovo Legion Go S</ins> –</a> the first third-party SteamOS handheld gaming device – as well as its &quot;stretchy&quot; laptop, the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html"><ins>ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable</ins></a> that extends 2.7 inches taller with a touch of a button. To Lenovo&#39;s credit, both products were actually released and available for sale within months, unlike the vaporware that seems to comprise the bulk of many companies&#39; CES announcements.</p>
<p>Lastly, don&#39;t be surprised if we see some new Motorola smartphones, given that Lenovo is the parent company of the phone manufacturer. Maybe a new <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-is-blowing-out-the-razr-line-with-three-new-models-starting-at-just-700-160053171.html"><ins>Razr foldable</ins></a>?

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram’s top exec Adam Mosseri expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and discussed the implications for the platform and users.</p>
<p>Mosseri <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html">shared his thoughts</a> on broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. “Everything that made creators matter — the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked — is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,” he wrote. “The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.” He added: “There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.”</p>
<p>Mosseri doesn’t address the risk that this will alienate many photographers and other creators who have already grown frustrated with the app — it looks like Instagram is leaning into the AI firehose. And hey: whatever keeps its users using it.</p>
<p>Mosseri suggests many complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of “polished” square images, he says, “is dead.” Instead of trying to “make everyone look like a professional photographer,” Mosseri says that more “raw” and “unflattering” images will be how creators can prove they are real — not AI.</p>

<p>CES kicks off this weekend. We’ve got a full <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html">preview</a> that we’ll update in the run-up to the full show, but the major tech announcements will likely center on chips (ah, AI) and new TV tech (ah, CES). Intel is finally taking the wraps off its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips — the first to debut on the company’s 18A process. With a promised 50 percent performance boost, Intel needs to prove it can still compete with NVIDIA and AMD. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote at the Las Vegas show, while AMD’s Lisa Su teases Ryzen 9000-series refreshes and more.</p>
<p>This year’s TV obsession is Micro RGB. Samsung is going big — literally — with a Micro RGB lineup spanning 55 to 115 inches. LG, meanwhile, has its own Micro RGB Evo panels, boasting over a thousand dimming zones for that elusive “perfect” contrast. We’ll be on the ground in Vegas to separate the legitimate, exciting new tech from the marketing fluff and AI assistant tchotchkes. And remember me mentioning the celebrity CES parade? Well, will.i.am is back at CES, this time curiously involved with <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html"><ins>LG’s portable speakers</ins></a>.

<p>OneXPlayer is quickly establishing itself as a company unafraid to get weird as hell. (Take, for example, its <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PacrCXAl55nIQWQP0kqbWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xMzQ2/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/4fc3d320-0115-11f0-b3b3-784330cb720c"><ins>pseudo-foldable dual-screen console</ins></a>). This time, while it initially appears to be another standard dual-screen model, the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet instead uses a single foldable screen. The OneXSugar Wallet was teased in a 54-second video on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili.<em> Retro Handhelds</em> reports the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. That’s a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded, making it very retro-gaming friendly.</p>
<p>Given the foldable screen tech, the price might not be. OneXSugar hasn’t shared that detail yet.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss minimal phone pioneer Punkt is back with another model, the MC03. The new handset continues Punkt&#39;s focus on privacy, security and digital minimalism.</p><p>If you&#39;ve never seen Punkt&#39;s MP01 and MP02, the company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.punkt.ch/pages/the-history-of-mp01-mobile-phone" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">gorgeously minimal dumb phone line</a>, they&#39;re something to behold. (The MP01 is quite literally a museum piece, in New York’s Museum of Modern Art.) Meanwhile, this new MC03 is the company&#39;s second stab at a more practical touchscreen smartphone, following 2023’s MC02. What you lose in physical beauty and tactile buttons, you gain in flexibility.</p><p>As before, the smartphone runs the privacy- and security-focused <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.apostrophy.ch/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">AphyOS</a>, based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The fork on the MC03 appears to borrow a page from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/light-phone-iii-review-minimalism-stretched-to-the-point-of-frustration-141559294.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the Light Phone line</a>. Its UI includes a Light Phone-adjacent row of text for the most common shortcuts, like mail, contacts and calendar.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/punkt.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/punkt.jpg" style="height:1421px;width:2370px;" alt="Marketing image of the Punkt MC03 phone. A dark UI shows text shortcuts for common apps and tasks." data-uuid="3b217bbb-0611-4ec1-aa81-99abab4dbc25"/><figcaption>Punkt MC03</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Punkt</div></figure><p>The MC03 splits data into two sections. There&#39;s The Vault, a secure enclave for apps Punkt has vetted for privacy and security. The second, Wild Web, gives you the freedom to install any Android app. To protect you while using that section, there&#39;s Ledger, which Punkt describes as &quot;strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls.&quot; Much like Android&#39;s Permission Manager, Ledger lets you define which data, sensors and background resources each app can access. In exchange for the tediousness of approving and denying permissions, you get more gradual control over your data.</p><p>All the apps from another Swiss company, Proton, are available in The Vault. (That includes Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN, and Proton Pass.) Proton founder and CEO Andy Yen said he hopes the collaboration can &quot;inject a little more choice into the marketplace, giving users more ways to take control of their data and regain their privacy.&quot;</p><p>Folks buying the MC03 aren&#39;t doing so to get cutting-edge hardware. The phone has an OLED display with a high (120Hz) frame rate, great for showing off that clean, black UI. The MC03 has a removable 5,200mAh battery and a 64MP camera. The device is rated IP68 for water and dust resistance.</p><p>Shipments for the Punkt MC03 begin this month in the European market. The phone costs €699 / CHF699 / £610. As with its previous models, the MC03 requires a subscription. (Punkt frames this as paying to retain your data, rather than paying with your data.) One year of the subscription is included with your purchase. After that, you&#39;ll have to pay €9.99 / CHF9.99 / £8.99 monthly. However, paying ahead for a long-term subscription lets you save up to 60 percent.

Instead of watching the pot or dealing with uneven results, you get fluffy, consistent rice with almost no effort. Modern rice cookers can do a lot more than white rice, too. Many handle brown rice, oatmeal and grains, and some function like mini multi-cookers for soups or stews.<br><br>With so many options available, the best rice cooker for you depends on how often you cook, how much counter space you have and which features matter most. We tested a range of models to find the best rice cookers for everything from small kitchens to big family dinners.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-rice-cookers">How we test rice cookers</h2> 
<p>Since rice is a foundation for so many different cuisines, I placed a high value on a machine’s ability to cook different types of rice well. I started testing each electric rice cooker by making a Japanese style, sushi-grade white rice. The appliances that delivered tasty results moved on to the brown rice round, then the top performers made long-grain white basmati as a final challenge. Some models I tested included a steamer basket, but I didn&#39;t try all of them out. This is a rice-only party. Multi-cookers and steaming functions are merely a nice bonus in these, although if that&#39;s a feature you want, an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-guide-131534709.html">instant pot</a> might be more your jam.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>While I weighed rice tastiness and texture as the most important criteria, I also assessed how easy the machines were to use and to clean. That includes things like how intuitive the cooking functions are, whether the inner pot is nonstick and how well the keep warm setting performs. I also took note of helpful kitchen tools that came included like a measuring cup, which is essential when getting the amount of water just right for each cup of rice. Because a cool piece of gear that sits in your cabinet gathering dust is a cool, but ultimately useless piece of gear. I limited my testing to models retailing for less than $300, which felt like the most I could recommend investing in a specialized appliance, and value for cost wound up being the distinguishing point for a good rice cooker.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-rice-cooker-120015478.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-best-laptop-for-gaming-and-schoolwork-faqs">Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-gaming-laptops-good-for-school"><strong>Are gaming laptops good for school?</strong></h3> 
<p>As we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you&#39;re doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn&#39;t just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell&#39;s XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we&#39;d recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today&#39;s gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won&#39;t be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you&#39;re not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-gaming-laptops-last-longer-than-standard-laptops">Do gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops?</h3> 
<p>Not necessarily — it really depends on how you define &quot;last longer.&quot; In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime.</p> 
<p>But there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs.</p> 
<p>Gaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-the-role-of-gpu-in-a-computer-for-gaming-and-school">What is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school?</h3> 
<p>The GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school.</p> 
<p>For gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering.</p> 
<p>For schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you&#39;re doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starlink will lower the orbits of roughly 4,400 satellites this year as a safety measure, according to engineering VP, Michael Nicolls. In a post on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/michaelnicollsx/status/2006790372681220530?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">X</a>, Nicolls wrote that the company is &quot;beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation,&quot; in which all satellites orbiting at around 550 kilometers (342 miles) will be lowered to around 480 km (298 miles). The move is intended to reduce the risk of collisions, putting the satellites in a region that&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/theres-no-easy-answer-to-being-a-space-janitor-170011469.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">less cluttered</a> and will allow them to deorbit more quickly should an incident occur.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways,&quot; Nicolls wrote, also pointing to the coming solar minimum — a period in the sun&#39;s 11ish-year cycle when activity is lower — as one of the reasons for the move. The next solar minimum is expected to occur in the early 2030s. &quot;As solar minimum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a &gt;80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months,&quot; Nicolls wrote.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg" style="height:1398px;width:1296px;" alt="A screenshot of the X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls " data-uuid="dba03a94-e10d-4521-a7eb-a02873d74bc1"/><figcaption>A screenshot of an X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls announcing that satellites orbiting at around 500 kilometers will be lowered to 480km</figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figure><p>The announcement comes a few weeks after Starlink said one of its satellites had <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-starlink-satellite-just-exploded-and-left-trackable-debris-120002814.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">experienced an anomaly</a> that created some debris and sent it tumbling. Just a few days earlier, Nicolls <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://x.com/michaelnicollsx/status/1999630601046097947?s=20" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">posted</a> about a close call with a batch of satellites he said were launched from China seemingly without any attempt to coordinate with operators of existing satellites in the space. With his latest announcement, Nicolls added that lowering Starlink&#39;s satellites &quot;will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/starlink-is-lowering-thousands-of-satellites-orbits-to-reduce-risk-of-collisions-030509067.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has upgraded its Freestyle portable projector for 2026. The company announced a new model, the Freestyle+, ahead of CES, touting twice the brightness of its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and AI-powered screen optimization features. As with Freestyles past, the Freestyle+ offers 180-degree rotation and 360-degree audio. This one also supports Q-Symphony so it&#39;ll work with some Samsung soundbars. Samsung hasn&#39;t revealed much else in the way of specs or pricing, but it&#39;ll be showing off the Freestyle+ at CES 2026, so we&#39;re likely to learn more details soon.&nbsp;</p><p>While previous iterations of Samsung&#39;s compact projector offered automatic screen adjustment features, like auto focus and auto leveling, the Freestyle+ uses AI to take optimization a step further. With AI OptiScreen, as the company is calling it, the projector offers 3D auto keystone to fix distortion on uneven or non-flat surfaces, real-time focus when the projector is moved, automatic screen fit for compatible accessories and wall calibration to reduce visual distractions from the projection surface. It&#39;ll also support Samsung&#39;s Vision AI Companion.&nbsp;</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t announced a specific release date yet for the new projector, but says it&#39;s targeting the first half of the year. It&#39;ll be released in phases globally.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the many concerns about artificial intelligence these days is how the rush to build data centers is impacting local communities. Data centers can create a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">drain on resources</a>, and some utility companies have already said customers can expect to see their electricity bills <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/major-us-power-operator-says-ai-and-data-center-demands-are-pushing-prices-up-130030473.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">growing</a> as these facilities increase demand. There have been some discussions of what other <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/in-2025-ai-and-evs-gave-the-us-an-insatiable-hunger-for-power-133000673.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">power sources</a> could support the AI engine, and wind power specialist Airloom is one company that&#39;s looking to address the problem. Ahead of the business&#39; upcoming appearance at CES, we&#39;ve learned a bit about what Airloom has accomplished this year and what it is aiming for next.</p><p>Rather than the very tall towers typically used for this approach, Airloom&#39;s structures are 20 to 30 meters high. They are comprised of a loop of adjustable wings that move along a track, a design that’s akin to a roller coaster. As the wings move, they generate power just like the blades on a regular wind turbine do. Airloom claims that its structures require 40 percent less mass than a traditional one while delivering the same output. It also says the Airloom&#39;s towers require 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. In combination, the company says its approach is 85 percent faster to deploy and 47 percent less expensive than horizontal axis wind turbines. Airloom broke ground on a pilot site in June for testing out its approach and confirming how those figures work in practice. </p><p>It’s not feasible to bring a wind farm, even a small one, into CES, but Airloom will have a booth at the event with materials about its technology and engineering. While the business isn&#39;t in a consumer-facing field, the impact of Airloom&#39;s work could have a future positive impact on people if the data center boom continues.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/airloom-will-showcase-its-new-approach-to-wind-power-at-ces-160000063.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a tech writer, being very offline is sort of like being a marathon coach who doesn’t run. So in 2025, I tried to reverse years of studied avoidance towards the most ubiquitous technological phenomenon on earth —  I got back on social media. The change was short-lived.&nbsp;</p><p>My first exodus from the feeds took some work — disabling notifications, removing apps from my homescreen and then deleting accounts entirely. This time, the phone put itself down. The whole thing has simply lost its luster.</p><p>I started with Instagram. Every experience went like this: I’d see a single post from one of the rare family members or IRL friends who are active on the platform. Next, I was fed a sponsored post, followed by suggestions to follow randos. After that, a series of influencer videos that, admittedly, appeal to my taste (funny/absurdist women and dissertations on urban planning). That was followed up with more sponsored posts, mostly from brands I’d looked up for work. Then it’d circle back to the influencers. My eyes glazed over and I tossed the phone aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Years back, the platform gave off a jolt of quasi-social connection that I’d spend hours sucking up. I fed on pointless thoughts from an ex-coworker, vacation reels from a college roommate, a half-baked loaf of bread that an old friend dropped on the floor but took a picture of anyway. Now it’s a bare sliver of that stuff, shoehorned between towers of sponsored content and posts from people who make or promote their living on Instagram. The real people have left. The connection is gone. The FOMO is no more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I experienced some variation of the same disappointment on every platform I rejoined. When I got back on TikTok a few months <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-back-in-apples-app-store-in-the-us-014013369.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">after the ban</a>, it felt like a frenzied shopping mall. Every video seems to be about four seconds long and most are promotional and/or shoppable. YouTube Shorts is drowning in AI-generated videos, and I don’t hit up social media to watch fake footage of desperate wild animal babies clambering onto the boats of helpful humans. My life has no need for simulated toddlers admonishing their pets. Occasionally, I’d hit on something compelling: a clip from late night TV, a stupidly decadent dessert recipe, people from other countries explaining cultural subtleties.&nbsp;</p><p>But for me, these social media platforms are no longer velcro for the eyes. I remember losing focus, spending long hours on YouTube Shorts and IG. I’d look up bleary-eyed and shame-faced after hours scrolling TikTok’s For You Page. Now, after a few minutes, a bored ickiness sets in. I feel like I’m trapped in a carnival of bots hawking shampoo at me and I just want to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery how or why things feel different; The answer is always money. These billion- and trillion-dollar companies have shareholders who prize year-over-year performance over anything else. So we get more sponsored posts on Instagram.

The fact that I can’t connect with my fellow common people using their services is not surprising. The change isn’t even driving everyone away. Instagram reported more users than ever this year, to the tune of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-reaches-3-billion-monthly-users-160554420.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">35 percent of the planet</a>. Billions of users still scroll TikTok and watch YouTube Shorts. So maybe it’s just a me thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And I have options. Over-monetization may have made me not want to engage with a few social media behemoths, but things aren’t so dire everywhere. Bluesky reminds me of Twitter before X. I take comfort in seeing posts that prove most people are as dismayed as I am over a government and wider economic system that are nakedly uninterested in serving the public. The hot takes aren’t quite as funny as they were on Twitter years back — maybe it’s just all been said before or perhaps things have gotten too dire for levity. I still don’t end up spending a lot of time on the platform, however. It’s not as weird as it was before <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-surges-to-15-million-users-after-getting-a-million-sign-ups-in-one-week-224213573.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">the defection</a> and I get tired of the stream of news headlines contextualized with tut-tutting and handwringing — I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’d be easy to say that social media just isn’t my thing, but that’s not true because I can’t quit Reddit — the shining exception to my social media ennui. It feels filled with actual people. Ads exist, but in a subdued, manageable way. And every contributor, commenter and moderator I’ve come across on the app is militantly vigilant against the onslaught of artificially generated content. I also like the organizational structure. I know my Home tab will only expose me to my chosen subs and I derive great joy from happy cows, greeble-chasing cats, enigmatic night feelings and freaky abandoned spaces. I use my local subreddit r/Albuquerque daily to answer questions and keep tabs on the world (directly) around me.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Reddit is an outlier, a misfit exception to the rule, and now that it’s gone <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-now-a-publicly-traded-company-144455403.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">public</a>, it may follow a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">similar monetization</a> push. Bluesky is tiny, new and not <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/bluesky-figuring-out-how-to-make-money-without-spamming-you-with-ads" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">yet profitable</a>, so who knows where its financial journey will lead it (though the “<a target="_blank" rel="" class="link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bluesky-made-more-money-selling-160957010.html" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1">world without Caesars</a>” shirt gives us some hope).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s something lamentable about the loss of the connections we gleaned from platforms that were once compelling, engrossing and rife with the creativity of our fellow humans. Ultimately, any public-facing company that prioritizes profits over everything else has no incentive to look out for its users. So I don’t expect any of the larger social platforms to pull back on their monetization marches. For now, I’ve decided I’m comfortable with my admittedly narrow interaction with the world of social media. As a Gen-Xer, online-first wasn’t how my relationship to the world started out. And I’m pretty confident I know enough about other tech-related stuff to be useful to my editors and readers without a black belt in social.

These devices log details like body fat, muscle mass and water levels, then sync everything to your phone so you can see patterns instead of guessing. It is an easy way to track changes and stay motivated between workouts or check-ins with your doctor.<br><br>Some smart scales keep things simple and focus on just your data, while others tie into big fitness platforms or support multiple users under one roof. With so many choices, we pulled together the best smart scales to help you find one that fits your goals and your budget.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-smart-scale-safety"><strong>Smart scale safety</strong></h2> 
<p>There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.”</p> 
<p>A meta-analysis from <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742706/">2016</a> found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.138.suppl_1.10962">2018 study</a>, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smart-scale">What to look for in a smart scale</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-weight">Weight</h3> 
<p>A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you&#39;re after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity">Connectivity</h3> 
<p>Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bone-density">Bone density</h3> 
<p>The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-body-fat-percentage-and-muscle-mass">Body fat percentage and muscle mass</h3> 
<p>Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-bmi">BMI</h3> 
<p>A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/">overly simplistic</a> and often <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/august/obesitymortality-paradox-demon">greatly misleading</a>. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-pulse-wave-velocity">Pulse Wave Velocity</h3> 
<p>French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wearables-and-integration">Wearables and integration</h3> 
<p>Pairing your smart scale with wearables like <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html">fitness trackers</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">smartwatches</a> can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-display">Display</h3> 
<p>Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-app-and-subscriptions">App and subscriptions</h3> 
<p>You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-data-portability">Data portability</h3> 
<p>Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.</p> 
<p>All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.)</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-power">Power</h3> 
<p>It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-and-which-smart-scales-we-tested">How we tested and which smart scales we tested</h2> 
<p>For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-mi-xiaomi-body-composition-scale-2">Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2</h3> 
<p>Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four.</p>

<p>Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway.</p>

<p>Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health.</p> 
<p>It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat.</p>

<p>Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady.</p> 
<p>Joking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress.</p>

<p>Garmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies.</p>

<p>At the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look.</p>

<p>If you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a <em>super</em>car, or a <em>hyper</em>car if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a <em>super</em>-smart scale, or a <em>hyper</em>-smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-smart-scales-faqs">Smart scales FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-smart-scale-and-a-regular-scale">What&#39;s the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale?</h3> 
<p>A regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model.</p> 
<p>What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing.</p>

<p>When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it.</p> 
<p>Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s no secret that AI-generated content <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">took over</a> our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram&#39;s top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.</p><p>Mosseri shared the thoughts in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DS76UiklIDf/media" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a lengthy post</a> about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. &quot;Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.&quot;</p><p>But Mosseri doesn&#39;t seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is &quot;a lot of amazing AI content&quot; and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by &quot;fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.&quot;</p><p>From Mosseri (emphasis his):</p><blockquote><p>Social media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that<strong> it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media</strong>. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.</p></blockquote><p>On some level, it&#39;s easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we&#39;ve previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/researchers-say-current-ai-watermarks-are-trivial-to-remove-204414059.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">easy to remove</a> and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta&#39;s own labels are <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-hides-warning-labels-for-ai-edited-images-143004313.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">far from clear</a> and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-oversight-board-calls-metas-uneven-ai-moderation-incoherent-and-unjustifiable-100056893.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">can&#39;t reliably detect</a> AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.</p><p>That Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram&#39;s 3 billion users understand what <em>is</em> real, that should largely be someone else&#39;s problem, not Meta&#39;s. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to &quot;to verify authenticity at capture.&quot; Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.</p><p>Mosseri also doesn&#39;t really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t consistently surface their posts to their on followers.</p><p>But Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of &quot;polished&quot; square images, he says, &quot;is dead.&quot; Camera companies, in his estimation, are &quot;are betting on the wrong aesthetic&quot; by trying to &quot;make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.&quot; Instead, he says that more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;unflattering&quot; images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html?src=rss]]></description>

There are three titles to play this month, all of which drop on January 6. As always, you’ll retain access to these games as long as your subscription remains active.</p>

<p>First up, there&#39;s <em>Need For Speed Unbound</em>. This is a racing game that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/need-for-speed-unbound-release-date-trailer-174505124.html"><ins>came out at the tail-end of 2022</ins></a> and was the first entry in the franchise for several years before that. It has a unique visual style, thanks to cel-shaded graphics, with all kinds of vehicles to choose from. There are street racing challenges, weekly qualifiers and a minigame that has you outrunning the cops. The rapper A$AP Rocky also plays a prominent role in the narrative. It&#39;ll only available for PS5.</p>

<p><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> is a recently-released remake of a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-29-disney-epic-mickey-review.html"><ins>2010 Wii game</ins></a>, but there&#39;s no Wiimote waggle here. This is just a great platformer with plenty of fan service for long-time Disney fans. Warren Spector, the lead designer of <em>Deus Ex</em>, was heavily involved in the making of this one. It&#39;ll be playable on both PS4 and PS5.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper</em> is a remarkable indie that has been floating around in early access for several years. The mining sim is now finished and offers an emphasis on crafting, base-building and, of course, exploration. While the game is playable solo, it&#39;s primarily intended as a multiplayer experience for up to eight people.</p>
<p>As the year ends, so does access to December&#39;s PS Plus Monthly titles. Subscribers have until January 5 to download <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, <em>Killing Floor 3</em>, <em>The Outlast Trials</em>, <em>Synduality Echo of Ada</em> and <em>Neon White</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/januarys-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-need-for-speed-unbound-and-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-182335673.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chances are that if a VPN is marketed to everyday users, it more or less runs itself. As long as you go with one of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPNs</a> instead of setting up your own manual connection, the interface is likely built so you have to engage with it as little as possible. Generally, if you find yourself constantly thinking about your VPN while using it — as happened to me with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Norton VPN</a> — that&#39;s a bad thing and you should change providers.</p><p>That said, it&#39;s still useful to get a high-level view of how to use a VPN, especially if you&#39;ve never used one before. In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through how to download, install and configure a VPN on any platform and how to choose servers for specific situations. I&#39;ll also discuss specific steps for desktop and laptop computers, phones, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and routers.</p><h2 id="e5ae9320-9e97-41d7-9412-e57ddfe9f8d5">How to download and install a VPN</h2><p>There are over 100 VPNs available on the internet and the two big mobile app stores, but most of them follow a similar approach to download and installation. Except for certain <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">free VPNs</a>, you&#39;ll need to create an account on the VPN provider&#39;s website, install the VPN client, then use your account to log in. Here are the steps.</p><ol><li><p>In a web browser, navigate to a VPN provider&#39;s website. For suggestions on where to start, check out our list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">best VPN deals</a>. Click any link that mentions getting the VPN or claiming the deal — as a rule, they aren&#39;t hard to find.</p></li><li><p>Select a plan based on the length of time you need the VPN for, the features you want and the number of devices you&#39;d like to use the VPN on simultaneously. Add a payment method. You&#39;ll be prompted to create the username and password for a new account.</p></li><li><p><strong>On desktop</strong>, you can start with the Mac or Windows app store, though some VPNs require a download directly from their respective website. That’s generally the way to get the most feature-rich version of the VPN, but just make sure you’re downloading from the provider’s website to ensure you don’t get a malicious copycat. <strong>On mobile</strong>, the app store is your only choice, but don&#39;t forget to check the reviews and make sure you&#39;re getting the service you paid for — unfortunately, rival (and sometimes less scrupulous) VPN brands can use paid placements to appear higher on search results, even for a rival product. </p></li><li><p>Follow the pre-programmed installation flow. Again, don&#39;t let a VPN make any changes to your system if you haven&#39;t thoroughly vetted the provider (or gone with one of our recommendations). If it&#39;s safe, allow the VPN all the setup permissions it needs.</p></li><li><p>Finally, open the VPN client and sign in with the credentials you created in step two. You&#39;re now ready to start using your new VPN.</p></li></ol><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png" style="height:869px;width:1829px;" alt="Surfshark in Mac downloads folder" data-uuid="56f3ed7f-7483-4fc3-aed9-c2e389da2de0"><figcaption>Surfshark in Mac downloads folder</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>With so many VPNs on the market, this process won&#39;t always be the same. Sometimes you&#39;ll have to make the account before paying, and some mobile VPNs let you handle the whole process in-app. What&#39;s always true, though, is that a good VPN will make the signup flow as easy as possible. If you have trouble before you even log in, that&#39;s a red flag.</p><h3 id="eab57cd3-f062-45cc-b880-91db0fe05fa4">How to configure a VPN app</h3><p>Most VPNs are ready to go out of the box. However, even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;re a power user, it&#39;s a good idea to go through the settings and make sure they match what you need. Here are a few steps I recommend taking.</p><ol><li><p>Activate the kill switch. This feature monitors your connection to the VPN server. If it ever drops — either from problems in the server, your client or somewhere in between — the kill switch instantly cuts off your internet until your VPN connection is restored. This saves you from accidentally broadcasting anything sensitive while also ensuring you only connect to legitimate VPN servers (avoiding the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tunnelvisionbug.com/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Tunnelvision bug</a>).</p></li><li><p>Set up favorites and profiles. VPNs usually let you select servers you&#39;ll use regularly, websites you&#39;ll often connect to through the VPN and other preferences that will appear immediately when you open the app. Some go further, like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>, which lets you create user profiles that bundle several preferences together.</p></li><li><p>Decide if you want the VPN to automatically launch and connect when you start up your computer.</p></li><li><p>Check on split tunneling. There may be cases where you want a certain app or site to work outside the VPN, or where you want everything to go unencrypted except one site or app. You can set up a split tunnel when you need it, but if there&#39;s one you know you&#39;ll use regularly, it helps to build it early.</p></li><li><p>Activate or deactivate any content blockers the VPN comes with, including ad blockers, malware detectors and parental controls, as you see fit.</p></li><li><p>Decide whether you want the VPN to send you notifications, and how.</p></li><li><p>Select a VPN protocol. It&#39;s almost always best to let the VPN choose for itself, but it&#39;s helpful to at least know where the protocol-switching option is. Occasionally, if one protocol isn&#39;t working, you can troubleshoot by selecting another.</p></li></ol><p>You can do all this by digging into your VPN&#39;s preferences control panel. A gear seems to be the universal icon for that, but Mac users may also find it by picking &quot;preferences&quot; or &quot;settings&quot; from the menu bar. When you find the preferences menu, go through each tab in turn and make sure everything is the way you like it.</p><h3 id="511e0968-4f3a-4690-aad7-bfb431046f9b">How to choose a VPN server</h3><p>Picking a server location is the final box to check before connecting. You nearly always have the option of letting the VPN pick the best server. Most apps tend to determine the best server with a latency test, so it will almost always be a node very close to your physical location.</p><p>If you just want anonymity online, that&#39;s fine — it doesn&#39;t matter which IP address you use as long as it&#39;s not your real one. But several VPN use cases do require a specific server location. For those, follow one simple rule: Pick a server in the place you want your signal to come from.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png" style="height:1188px;width:1588px;" alt="Choosing locations on Surfshark" data-uuid="ad20ffff-2e09-42e7-93d3-bcae41563393"><figcaption>Choosing locations on Surfshark</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>For example, let&#39;s say you want to watch <em>The Office, </em>but you&#39;re only subscribed to Netflix and not Peacock. Luckily, Netflix is licensed to show <em>The Office </em>in the U.K. If you connect to a British server location before opening Netflix, you&#39;ll be able to access the show without paying for an extra subscription. (Of course, make sure VPNs aren’t expressly banned by the streaming service’s terms of service before accessing it while using one.)</p><p>Other than streaming, the most common reason you&#39;ll need a specific VPN server is to get around firewalls that block websites. Whether it&#39;s your school doing the censorship, your workplace or your entire state, the solution is the same: Pick a VPN server outside the restricted region. Censorship systems filter by location — they can&#39;t block where they don&#39;t have jurisdiction. Get a new virtual location and you should be free and clear. (Always be cognizant of the laws on VPN usage in your location before activating them.)</p><h3 id="5ea22123-706d-4712-80ee-c4c41d00eaa2">When to use a VPN (and when not to)</h3><p>It&#39;s good to get into the habit of connecting to your VPN whenever you get online. You can never be sure what information your ISP is gathering on you. If you&#39;re using unprotected Wi-Fi, or a public network with a clearly visible password, anybody might be listening in. Even if you don&#39;t need a particular location, always be using your VPN.</p><p>The only reason you might want to be online without a VPN is that certain websites, especially online banks, get suspicious if they note repeated logins to the same account from too many different IP addresses. For those cases, you can either set up a split tunnel to exclude the website from encryption, or temporarily turn your VPN off altogether.</p><h2 id="1254cc3e-6927-44fa-9785-06bcc25cbd13">Instructions for specific devices</h2><p>Although most VPNs try to keep their apps similar on every platform, the strictures of differing hardware and software lead them to install and operate differently. In case you still have questions after reading the general guide above, this section goes into detail on every platform where you might use a VPN.</p><h3 id="69d7feab-ae9f-4c04-b668-4b23ed247ede">How to use a VPN on desktop</h3><p>After subscribing to a VPN on <strong>Windows</strong>, you should be directed to download an EXE file — if this doesn&#39;t happen, log into your account on the website and find the downloads center. Find the folder where the EXE is saved, double-click it and follow the onscreen instructions.</p><p>On <strong>Mac</strong>, the process is more or less the same, except you&#39;ll usually get a PKG file instead of an EXE. Go to your downloads folder (either in Finder or through your web browser) and double-click the PKG file. Grant the VPN whatever permissions it needs. (Again, this is why it’s important to only use a legitimate vendor, such as the ones we recommend.)</p><p>Once installed, you can open the VPN client at any time by double-clicking the icon again. Some VPNs open as separate windows, while others will add icons to your toolbar. This often varies by platform; if you&#39;re concerned that your VPN doesn&#39;t look like a screenshot you&#39;ve seen, check which operating system the image comes from.</p><h3 id="6a9b37a7-441d-49e7-994c-5701c621aa09">How to use a VPN on mobile</h3><p>On <strong>Android </strong>and <strong>iOS</strong>, you&#39;ll download your VPN app through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, respectively. Even if you get started through a mobile browser, it will probably redirect you to the app store for the actual download and installation.</p><p>Follow the usual step for downloading an app: search for its name in the app store, click &quot;Get&quot; or &quot;Install,&quot; then let your phone cook. As always, so long as it&#39;s a vetted VPN, grant it the permissions it needs. You may be able to download and install the VPN first, then create your account and submit payment through the app afterward.</p><p>One final note: several leading VPNs offer free trials for mobile users. If you see a button that says something like &quot;get free trial,&quot; you may be able to use the VPN for several days without paying. Just be warned that if the trial lapses, you might get automatically signed up for a plan that&#39;s longer than you&#39;d like.</p><h3 id="ba5edfbb-5471-45fc-9fc0-70bc182b1fad">How to use a VPN browser extension</h3><p>VPNs offer browser extensions as lightweight versions of their main clients. While a desktop or mobile VPN reroutes everything that device sends to the internet, a browser extension only protects traffic through your web browser. You can use one as a primitive form of split tunneling, but they&#39;re mainly for basic convenience — most of what you do online goes through a browser, so it&#39;s nice to be able to protect your connection without opening a separate app.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png" style="height:1352px;width:2673px;" alt="NordVPN browser extension on Chrome" data-uuid="a448ba0a-eb2d-4c2f-8d5a-75d05e9b58ad"><figcaption>NordVPN browser extension on Chrome</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>To use a VPN browser extension, just create your account as normal, then download the extension from your VPN&#39;s website. You can manage it from your browser&#39;s extensions center. That&#39;s a jigsaw piece at the top-right corner on most browsers, including Chrome, Edge and Firefox.</p><h3 id="281a98b7-ad86-42d8-960c-427b3d41fb36">How to use a VPN on a smart TV</h3><p>You can use a VPN to change your location and stream international content directly to a smart TV. The catch is that not all smart TV brands support VPN apps. For those that don&#39;t, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-vpn-to-your-tv-143736648.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">you&#39;ll have to find a workaround</a>.</p><p>The good news is that a ton of the best smart TVs can natively host VPNs, including <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-chromecast-or-google-tv-140619467.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Google TV</a>, Android TV, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-a-vpn-on-fire-tv-101822833.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Amazon Fire TV</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-apple-tv-113345245.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Apple TV</a> (though only tvOS 17 and above).

You can also install a VPN on your router (see below) so your smart TV automatically uses the router&#39;s location.</p><p>Finally, you can get a temporary fix by using your computer as a Wi-Fi hotspot while it has a VPN active. Follow the steps for your operating system.</p><p>On Windows:</p><ol><li><p>In your system settings, go to &quot;Network &amp; Internet&quot; and turn on the mobile hotspot.</p></li><li><p>Go to &quot;Network &amp; Sharing Center&quot; and click &quot;Change adapter settings.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Right-click the name of your VPN provider and go to &quot;Properties,&quot; then &quot;Sharing.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Check the boxes next to &quot;Allow other network users to connect through this computer&#39;s internet connection&quot; and &quot;Allow other network users to control or disable the shared internet connection.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Home networking connection&quot; dropdown and select &quot;Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Open your VPN client and connect to a server in your desired location.</p></li><li><p>On your smart TV, open the internet connections menu and select the name of your PC. Your TV is now online through the VPN server.</p></li></ol><p>On Mac:</p><ol><li><p>Open system settings and go to the &quot;General&quot; tab.

If you want to use a VPN while gaming — and I recommend that for safety if you&#39;re planning to play online — you can use two of the same methods that work for a smart TV: install a VPN on your router, or get your console online through a Mac or PC hotspot.</p><h3 id="348a0322-4456-4ddf-8252-083e29f2d15e">How to install a VPN on a router</h3><p>When you install a router VPN, anything that gets online through your home network will be protected, including game consoles, TVs and smart devices that don&#39;t support VPNs natively. It&#39;s not a process for the faint of heart, though. You&#39;ll need to get a new router and potentially install VPN firmware on it yourself. If you want to go this route, the easiest option is to get an <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=52aa4501-7372-4990-ab5c-a027e398a215&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;linkText=ExpressVPN+Aircove+router&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9haXJjb3ZlPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTJhYTQ1MDEtNzM3Mi00OTkwLWFiNWMtYTAyN2UzOThhMjE1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9haXJjb3ZlPyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQcQcoBXc2t-ZvPzzwUVEtcI1Gdh5Zyj_vAr0g6ymVzJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Faircove%3F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ExpressVPN;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.expressvpn.com/aircove?">ExpressVPN Aircove router</a> — not only does it come with all the settings done for you, but it can be managed through the same clean interface as ExpressVPN&#39;s other apps.</p><p>We don&#39;t have space here to go through the entire process, but here&#39;s a general overview. First, get a router with firmware that supports VPN configurations — most ISP default routers don&#39;t, so you&#39;ll have to go third-party.</p><p>Next, go to the downloads center of your VPN&#39;s website and look for the section with VPN configurations. A &quot;configuration&quot; is a complete set of the information needed to access a certain VPN server through a certain protocol — say, a Proton VPN server in Arizona through OpenVPN. Download a configuration file for the protocol and location you want all your home devices to connect through.</p><p>Finally, open your router control panel by entering your router&#39;s IP address into a web browser address bar, then log in with your router credentials (these should be marked on the router itself unless you&#39;ve changed them). Go to the VPN tab — which should be there if it&#39;s a router with VPN firmware — and upload the profile you downloaded from the VPN website. Use the same router control panel to activate and deactivate the router VPN connection.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h3 id="jump-link-best-mirrorless-cameras">Best mirrorless cameras</h3> 
<p>Mirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyPKBBeHy6k&amp;t=1s">video</a>. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h3 id="jump-link-best-compact-camera">Best compact camera</h3> 
<p>This category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p> 
<p>Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-camera">What to consider before choosing a camera</h2> 
<p>Though smartphones get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sensor-size">Sensor size</h3> 
<p>There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.</p> 
<p>Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject&#39;s eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult.</p> 
<p>The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm&#39;s X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It&#39;s cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it&#39;s ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.</p> 
<p>Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.</p> 
<p>The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That&#39;s used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-autofocus">Autofocus</h3> 
<p>For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-displays">Displays</h3> 
<p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenses">Lenses</h3> 
<p>DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you&#39;re stuck with what&#39;s built into a compact camera. While that&#39;s great for portability, a single lens means you&#39;re going to sacrifice <em>something</em> along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it&#39;s slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens.</p> 
<p>When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-video-recording">Video recording</h3> 
<p>When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.</p> 
<p>In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it&#39;s preferable to have both.) How&#39;s the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG just revealed several new speakers in the xboom line <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-121511445.html"><ins>ahead of CES 2026</ins></a>. These speakers are part of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-xboom-speakers-hands-on-built-with-the-help-of-william-and-a-dash-of-ai-170030904.html"><ins>an ongoing collaboration</ins></a> with will.i.am from Black Eyed Peas, who is on board as the &quot;experimental architect&quot; involved with &quot;development, design and brand marketing.&quot;</p>
<p>These speakers are fairly different from one another, but they all have AI in common. Each speaker includes an algorithm that automatically adjusts the EQ after analyzing the audio content and the listening space. Many also feature an AI algorithm for ambient lighting, which will adjust the lights to match the song being played.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The xboom Stage 501 is intended for parties and karaoke sessions. It features additional AI that can remove vocals from &quot;virtually any song&quot; and even adjust the pitch. The battery lasts for around 25 hours and can operate while plugged in. The speaker delivers up to 220W of power, with dual woofers and full-range drivers. It boasts a five-sided cabinet design that allows for vertical and horizontal placement.</p>

<p>The xboom Blast is a boombox with a 99Wh battery that allows for up to 35 hours of continuous playback. That&#39;s a mighty fine metric. This is a modern boombox, so it&#39;s designed for durability. There are edge bumpers and a side rope handle for carrying.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/70914ae0-e5a5-11f0-b79b-04c0d7752f40" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/70914ae0-e5a5-11f0-b79b-04c0d7752f40" style="height:616px;width:496px;" alt="A speaker" data-uuid="eef59bca-55b2-3f9e-9c2b-51250427dc36"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure>
<p>The Mini is a tiny doodad that can be placed just about anywhere. It offers ten hours of battery life per charge and a strap for easy placement. The speaker also includes a built-in tripod mount.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/4d20b8c0-e5a5-11f0-8ffb-33faf0a0ccd3" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/4d20b8c0-e5a5-11f0-8ffb-33faf0a0ccd3" style="height:752px;width:1196px;" alt="A speaker." data-uuid="951c15c3-09a6-3a08-b458-06f4e97b5b8d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure>
<p>The Rock is a, well, rock-shaped speaker that&#39;s larger than the Mini but can still be held in the palm of the hand. The battery lasts for ten hours and the design is focused on durability. It has been tested to &quot;seven military standards&quot; to ensure reliability in &quot;challenging outdoor environments.&quot; This is an upgrade of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/lg-xboom-go-xg2t-review"><ins>pre-existing XG2 model</ins></a>.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have pricing or exact availability on this stuff yet, though the speakers will be on display at LG&#39;s booth at CES. The company has said that all four of these gadgets will come out in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html?src=rss]]></description>

In its worst-case-scenario model, the IDC predicts PC shipments could shrink by up to 8.9 percent in 2026 because of the high cost of memory.</p><p>&quot;Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5,&quot; IDC writes. That&#39;s continued to drive up the price of the RAM that is available for PC makers, which has naturally led to them to raise the price of their own products to stay above water. For example, modular PC maker Framework has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://frame.work/blog/in-stock-on-framework-desktop-and-updates-on-the-industry-wide-silicon-crunch" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">had to raise prices</a> on some of its laptops and parts, and says &quot;further cost and price increases are highly likely over the next months.&quot; The IDC says prices could rise by 6 to 8 percent in 2026 if its most pessimistic scenario comes true.</p><p>The timing of this RAM crunch is particularly ironic because selling <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">&quot;AI PCs&quot;</a> — computers with neural processing units that can run AI models locally — were supposed to be one of the things pulling the PC industry out of its post-pandemic slump. Instead, those computers&#39; larger RAM needs leave them more vulnerable to the effects of the AI industry itself. Computers aren&#39;t the only electronics impacted, either. The IDC says the average selling price of a smartphone could grow by 6 to 8 percent in its most pessimistic scenario, and smartphone shipments could shrink by as much as 5.2 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like Apple and Samsung, with cash to spare and long-term supply agreements, could weather these higher RAM prices and keep things consistent for a year or two, according to the IDC. For everyone else, though, the near-term is looking much more expensive, and by necessity, much less adventurous.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung will have two new inexpensive mobile devices <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-welcomes-galaxy-a17-5g-galaxy-tab-a11-galaxy-ecosystem/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">arriving</a> on the US market next month. The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7. Arriving on January 8, the Galaxy Tab A11+ will retail for $250.&nbsp;</p><p>The Galaxy A17 5G has a 6.7” FHD+ Super AMOLED display and is powered by the same Exynos 1330 chip found in the Galaxy A16 5G. The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD. Its 5,000mAh battery also supports fast-charging, a feature we&#39;re <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">happy to see</a> becoming more of an industry standard this year. Essentially, this is more of the same from Samsung, but this product line has a solid legacy of decent smartphones that don&#39;t break the bank. Don&#39;t be surprised if this joins our lineup of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best budget Android phones</a> come 2026.</p><p>The other new entry-level device is the Galaxy Tab A11+, which boasts an 11-inch LCD display. The rear camera is 8MP and the front one is 5MP. It has an option for 6GB of RAM with 128GB in storage, or for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here. There are many swankier tablets on the market these days, but if you&#39;re looking for a bare-bones option, this Samsung offering is a solid consideration.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-unveils-its-new-200-galaxy-a17-5g-smartphone-arriving-in-january-184846560.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow&#39;s the big day, and I don&#39;t just mean New Year&#39;s Eve. The series finale of <em>Stranger Things</em> airs tomorrow, and Netflix has released a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQ13jsLDms">trailer for the last episode</a>. We&#39;re given only flashes of the final episode, along with a voiceover of an emotional Jim Hopper telling Eleven he needs her to fight one last time.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just over 1 minute and 30 seconds long, with what appears to be only about 30 seconds of new footage. There isn&#39;t much to go on here, as most of the footage features emotional moments from seasons past. Netflix no doubt is hoping to keep much of the excitement under wraps until tomorrow&#39;s premiere.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><strong>Warning: Some spoilers ahead for </strong><strong><em>Stranger Things</em></strong><strong> season 5.</strong></p>
<div id="42ea55a6ccb3466f988f3cb9b46a8dff"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AfQ13jsLDms?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Among the new images we briefly see Vecna, hooked up to the ceiling in his gross cave of power on his other world. There&#39;s also an explosion at what looks like a military site, plus a few more out-of-context flashes of our heroes.</p>
<p>One particularly ominous moment shows Hopper walking around a smoke-filled room with almost zero visibility, gun drawn, when we see what looks to be Vecna appear behind him. We also see Eleven climb back into the sensory-deprivation tank in the Upside Down, presumably to take the fight to the show’s big bad.</p>
<p>The only continuous scene in the trailer shows most of the gang standing atop a radio tower as Vecna&#39;s world moves close enough to collide with the tower&#39;s tip. Dustin lets out a &quot;mother of God&quot; as the so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme the group cooked up in Chapter Seven appears to be well underway.</p>
<p>After nine years and five seasons, we will finally reach a conclusion for the heroes of Hawkins. The episode premieres at 8PM ET (5PM PT). For those still craving more from the world of Hawkins after the finale, Netflix is releasing a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-first-trailer-for-the-animated-stranger-things-spin-off-is-here-172128527.html">Stranger Things animated series</a> in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-has-released-a-trailer-for-the-stranger-things-finale-171204480.html?src=rss]]></description>
