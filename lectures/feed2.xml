If you’ve got a MacBook Air, a slim Chromebook or a tablet you’d like to get more utility out of, a USB-C hub can help. Using just a single port on your device, these multiport adapters will let you hook up screens, tap into Ethernet cables, connect mice and keyboards, and transfer data to drives and memory cards. Most also give you a way to power your device through the hub to maximize port availability. We tested over a dozen models to come up with picks for every budget. Here are the best USB-C hubs, according to our tests.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-usb-c-hub">What to look for in a USB-C hub</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-hub-vs-docking-station"><strong>Hub vs docking station</strong></h3> 
<p>The first thing to decide is whether you need a USB-C hub or a USB-C docking station. There’s no set standard for what differentiates the two, but docking stations tend to have more ports, offer a separate DC power adapter and cost more, with some reaching upwards of $400. We have a separate guide to the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-docking-station-160041863.html">best docking stations</a> to check out if you’re looking for something bigger than what we’re discussing here. USB-C hubs, in contrast, have between four and 10 ports, can support pass-through charging and typically cost between $30 and $150.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Hubs, sometimes also called dongles or even multiport adapters, make more sense for smaller setups with just a few peripherals, such as a monitor, a wired keyboard and mouse, and the occasional external drive. They’re also more portable, since they’re small and require no dedicated power. That could be useful if you change work locations but want to bring your accessories with you, or if you want to replace your laptop with a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">more powerful tablet</a>. A docking station or Thunderbolt dock makes more sense for someone who needs a robust setup for their laptop, including multiple external monitors, webcams, stream decks, microphones and so on.</p> 
<p>Both docks and hubs make it easy to grab your laptop off your desk for a meeting or other brief relocation and when you get back, you only need to plug in one cable to get all your accessories reconnected. Of course, if you just need to plug in one peripheral, you may not need a hub or a dock, a simple USB-C adapter, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5611e47c-9ecd-44d1-bf4d-bb3708b5554e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;linkText=HDMI+to+USB-C&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xODExNDM3LVJFRy9wbHVnYWJsZV91c2JjX2hkbWk4a191c2JfY190b19oZG1pXzhrLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU2MTFlNDdjLTllY2QtNDRkMS1iZjRkLWJiMzcwOGI1NTU0ZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTgxMTQzNy1SRUcvcGx1Z2FibGVfdXNiY19oZG1pOGtfdXNiX2NfdG9faGRtaV84ay5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYO1AcBMNrNBgYcyZWuPQfzhTSTfl52RJJLakkYFIxFX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1811437-REG%2Fplugable_usbc_hdmi8k_usb_c_to_hdmi_8k.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1811437-REG/plugable_usbc_hdmi8k_usb_c_to_hdmi_8k.html">HDMI to USB-C</a> or USB-A to USB-C, may do the trick.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> 
<p>For a USB-C hub to work, it needs to connect to a port on your laptop or tablet that supports video, data and power — all of which is covered by anything listed as USB 3.0 or better, including USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4. The port, of course, needs to be Type-C as well. The sea of laptops out there is vast, so it’s hard to make generalizations, but modern laptops, including Windows and Apple models, should have at least one USB-C port that will suffice, and indeed, every one of our top picks for the <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">best laptops</a> do — including our top pick, the M4 MacBook Air.</p> 
<p>Next, it’s a matter of finding a good USB-C hub that has the right connections for your needs. Most hubs offer some combo of HDMI, USB, SD card reader, Ethernet and 3.5 mm ports. If you have a 4K monitor and would like at least a 60Hz refresh rate, you’ll need a hub with an HDMI 2.0 port — HDMI 1.4 only goes up to 30Hz. HDMI 2.1 will handle 4K at up to 120Hz, but hubs that have adopted that standard aren’t as common just yet. Keep in mind that a low refresh rate can cause your screen to feel laggy, making your mouse appear glitchy and your webcam movements to look delayed.</p> 
<p>Additional USB ports on these accessories are usually USB Type-A or USB Type-C. They can support data with different transfer rates, typically 5Gbps or 10Gbps. Some ports only handle passthrough power and no data, and some can do data, power and video, so it’s best to check the spec list to make sure you’re getting the support you need. Keep in mind that a hub may bill itself as a 7-in-1, but one of those ports may not be usable for anything other than charging.</p> 
<p>Standard SD and microSD cards are useful for transferring data from cameras and the like or for offloading files from your hard drive, and many hubs have those slots. Ethernet ports may deliver faster internet speeds than your Wi-Fi and a hub with a 3.5mm jack can bring back the wired headphone connection that some laptops have ditched.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-power-delivery"><strong>Power delivery</strong></h3> 
<p>Nearly all of the USB-C hubs I tested support passthrough charging. That means if your laptop or tablet only charges via USB, you don’t have to take up another port on your laptop to keep everything topped up. Unlike a docking station, powering a hub is optional. The one exception is if you want to close the lid on your laptop while you work on an external monitor. Most computers will go into sleep mode if the lid is closed without power, so either the laptop or the hub will need to be plugged into the wall to prevent that from happening.</p> 
<p>Many of the newer hubs include a 100W USB-C power delivery (PD) port, with a healthy 80 to 85 watts going to your Mac, PC, iPad or Android tablet (the hubs take a little of the juice for themselves, hence the 15-watt or so difference). In my tests, a powered USB hub ran hotter than when it wasn&#39;t passing the charge through, so I prefer to power the computer directly using its own charger. But for tablets or other devices with no extra ports, that PD option is important.</p> 
<p>Some PD ports are also data ports — which is both good and bad. On one hand, it feels wasteful to use a perfectly good data port just for boring old electricity. But on the other hand, USB-C connections that only carry a charge are less versatile, and it makes it seem like it has more accessory hookups than it actually does.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design"><strong>Design</strong></h3> 
<p>There’s surprisingly little design variation among hubs. Most look like a flat slab, a little smaller than a smartphone, and have an attached Type-C host cable. The hues range from a silvery black to a silvery gray. Some are thinner than others, some have all ports on one edge and some have ports on both sides. All of this is just to say that aesthetics probably won’t make or break your buying decision.</p> 
<p>One variation that could tip the scales is the length of the cable. A longer one will give you more freedom as you arrange the hub on your desk, potentially even letting you hide it behind your laptop. Or you may prefer a shorter one to keep the hub neatly set beside your laptop.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-usb-c-hubs">How we test USB-C hubs</h2> 
<p>Before we test anything, we take a look at what’s available and how they’ve been received by shoppers, forum-goers and other publications. I became familiar with a few reputable brands when I was testing docking stations, so I looked into hubs from those companies as well. I focused on items that would help with an average day of productivity — not high-end setups or demanding gaming situations. Once I settled on a dozen or so that would make good candidates, I had them shipped to my humble office in the desert and started testing them out over the course of a few weeks.</p> 
<p>I used an M1 MacBook Pro running MacOS Sonoma as the host computer and plugged in accessories that include a 4K Dell monitor, a ZSA <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-26-the-best-ergonomic-keyboard.html">USB-C ergo keyboard</a>, a Logitech <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-mouse-140004638.html">USB-A gaming mouse</a>, an Elgato <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-webcams-123047068.html">USB-C 4K webcam</a>, a Logitech streaming light, a USB-A 3.0 Sandisk thumb drive, a USB-C Samsung T7 Shield external drive and a pair of wired headphones I got for free on an airplane (I should probably invest in some wired headphones, but the cord dangling on my chest drives me nutty so all my earbuds are wireless). I used high-end HDMI and USB-C cables to ensure that any data or connectivity issues weren’t related to my equipment.</p> 
<p>Then I put each USB-C hub through a gamut of basic tests. I looked at what could be plugged in at once, the resolution on the monitor, data transfer speeds, the overall build quality of the hub and general usability factors, like the placement of the ports and the length of the cords. And, finally, the price-to-value ratio helped determine the best ones for a few different use cases.</p>

The tethered cable is a lavish 13 inches long, the HDMI 2.0 port outputs clear and crisp 4K visuals at 60Hz and the high-speed data transfers are great. It has the coveted two USB-C data ports plus a PD port, and there’s even a headphone jack. The only thing that holds back a full-throated endorsement is the way our unit handled a streaming light. Having it on at full brightness made the webcam flicker every time. The issue went away at 75 percent brightness, but the same problem didn’t happen on any other hub I tested.</p>

In fact it’s a current recommendation in our <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html">iPad accessories guide</a> and it comes at a great $35 price. It gives you two USB-A ports as well as SD slots. But at this point, a 1.4 HDMI connection, which only supports 4K resolution at 30Hz feels a little retro. There’s also just a single USB-C downstream port and the data transfer tests proved to be a touch slower than the other hubs. But if you’ve got a lower resolution monitor and don’t need more than one USB-C, you won’t be disappointed with it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-anker-555-8-in-1">Anker 555 8-in-1</h3> 
<p>It was a tough call between the UGreen Revodoc Pro 109 and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Anker;elmt:;cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=aac3354f-048f-410b-ae8a-eb1da43ee6cf&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5611e47c-9ecd-44d1-bf4d-bb3708b5554e&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anker&amp;linkText=Anker+555+8-in-1&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmtlci5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYTgzODM_dmFyaWFudD0zNzQzODYwNDk2ODA4NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTYxMWU0N2MtOWVjZC00NGQxLWJmNGQtYmIzNzA4YjU1NTRlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmtlci5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYTgzODM_dmFyaWFudD0zNzQzODYwNDk2ODA4NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfMvI9WkuSgkoN0HS-H82hEqJH6AqOUUMH-t_UBDBBV0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa8383%3Fvariant%3D37438604968086" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.anker.com/products/a8383?variant=37438604968086">Anker 555 8-in-1</a> for our top recommendation. Both have a similar port array with an HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a PD USB-C and a USB-C 3.2 on the 555. And the Anker USB-C hub is $15 cheaper. We went with the UGreen hub for its more premium build, extra USB-A port and longer cord that gives you two extra inches to work with. But if you want to save a few bucks this hub is a worthwhile pick.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-startech-4-port-usb-c-hub-data-only"><strong>Startech 4-Port USB-C Hub (data only)</strong></h3> 
<p>I only became aware of Startech when I started researching for this guide. The quality is decent and the yellow accents are a welcome bit of color in the otherwise very gray world of hubs. The performance is solid, with no hiccups that I encountered. The brand’s <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.startech.com/en-us/usb-hubs/hb30cm3a1cb">4-Port USB-C Hub</a> has a long cord that wraps around the hub itself, which is unique. It doesn’t bother with power delivery, which isn’t an issue if you can power your computer directly. But the four USB ports (three Type-A and one Type-C) max out at 5Gbps and there’s no HDMI connector. It goes for $46, and unfortunately for it, there are cheaper ways to get a few more USB ports for your setup.</p>

The app “will remain active” for existing users.</p><p>A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the closures. &quot;We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement to Engadget. &quot;This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.&quot;</p><p>The cuts raise questions about Meta&#39;s commitment to supporting a VR ecosystem it has invested heavily in. The company hasn&#39;t announced any new VR headsets since the Quest 3S in 2024, and last month it &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">paused</a>&quot; planned Horizon OS headsets from Asus and Lenovo. Now, it&#39;s also pulling back on in-house game development too.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta is claiming, internally at least, that it remains committed to supporting the industry. “These changes do not mean we are moving away from video games,” Oculus Studios director Tamara Sciamanna wrote in a memo reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>. &quot;With this change we are shifting our investment to focus on our third-party developers and partners to ensure long-term sustainability.”</p><p><em>Have a tip for Karissa?

So, not so great!</p><p>Last week, Roblox <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-now-requires-age-verification-to-use-in-game-chat-163213512.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">made age verification mandatory</a> for anyone using the platform&#39;s chat feature. That process involves either submitting a facial age estimate via selfie or (optionally for anyone 13 or older) uploading a government ID check. After verifying, you can only chat with groups of players around your age.</p><p>The move came after reports grew of predators using the platform to groom young children. That, in turn, led to lawsuits from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Louisiana</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-over-alleged-child-safety-lapses-131500288.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Texas</a> and Kentucky. Meanwhile, Florida&#39;s attorney general has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-fights-protect-children-online-subpoenas-roblox-child" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">issued</a> criminal subpoenas.</p><p>So, it might not be hyperbole to say Roblox&#39;s survival could depend on how it handles this problem. It isn&#39;t exactly off to a hot start. There are reports of a 23-year-old being misidentified as a 16- to 17-year-old. (&quot;I don&#39;t want to be chatting with fucking children,&quot; they said.) Another report claimed an 18-year-old was placed in the 13 to 15 range.</p><p>But the problem is happening in reverse, too. Online videos show children spoofing the system into believing they were adults by using avatar images. One clever kid drew wrinkles and stubble on his face and was instantly deemed 21+. Another flashed a photo of Kurt Cobain and got an adult classification.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EN_Age_Check_Flow_1_9823.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EN_Age_Check_Flow_1_9823.png" style="height:699px;width:1242px;" alt="Four phone screens, showing the selfie age verification feature on Roblox" data-uuid="fd8010ba-60cb-42ab-b534-5f83a85904cc"><figcaption>The feature isn&#39;t working as planned, to say the least.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roblox</div></figure><p>In addition, Roblox <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/age-check-to-chat-update-fast-follow-roadmap/4238626" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">posted</a> last week that some parents were providing age checks on behalf of their children, leading to their children being placed in the 21+ category. The company said it&#39;s &quot;working on solutions to address&quot; that particular problem and will share more soon.</p><p>Developers with games on Roblox are upset. The platform&#39;s dev forum includes thousands of negative comments about the updates, with many of them wanting the entire update reversed. One shared a graph showing that the percentage using the chat feature dropped from around 90 percent to 36.5 percent.</p><p>Where does this leave Roblox? Well, with some developers describing games on the platform as feeling &quot;lifeless&quot; or like &quot;a total ghost town,&quot; the company has its hands full. It will have to figure out how to balance its priorities of keeping predators out without breaking things for everyone else.

There&#39;s also a separate field for identifying what you want to see less of, and a new &quot;build your 2026 algorithm&quot; that allows you to highlight three topics in particular.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/View_recent_photos.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/View_recent_photos.png" style="height:1494px;width:1179px;" alt="A screenshot of Instagram reels showing a ski jumper mid-air with a label that says &quot;snowboarding.&quot;" data-uuid="a7fbd7cd-9091-4591-b588-909677ded134"/><figcaption>Meta&#39;s algorithm tagged a skiing clip as &quot;snowboarding.&quot;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Instagram</div></figure><p>I don&#39;t yet have the 2026-specific control yet, but I was able to tweak some of my preferred topics and was surprised at how quickly the algorithm seemed to adjust. I added &quot;snowboarding&quot; as a topic and then later, when I clicked over to Reels, the first clip I saw was tagged &quot;snowboarding.&quot; Unfortunately, the video wasn&#39;t actually about snowboarding — it featured a clip of a freestyle skiing event — so Meta&#39;s systems might still need a little work at classifying the actual content. But given how sensitive the Reels algorithm can be, it&#39;s nice to have a way of opting out of interests even if you briefly went down a&nbsp; rabbit hole.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature won&#39;t, however, let you ask to see fewer ads. I tried to add &quot;ads&quot; to my &quot;what you want to see less of&quot; list and received an error. &quot;No results found. Try another topic or interest.&quot; I was able to successfully add &quot;sponsored content&quot; and &quot;AI&quot; to my &quot;see less&quot; list, though I&#39;m pretty sure the latter will affect videos about AI rather than those made with the help of it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-wants-you-to-personalize-your-reels-algorithm-for-2026-215252736.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Senate has passed the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE ) Act with unanimous consent, according to the bill’s co-sponsor <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-successfully-passes-bill-to-combat-nonconsensual-sexually-explicit-deepfake-images" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)</a>. The bill lets the subjects of nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfakes take civil action against the people who create and host them.</p><p>Deepfakes are a known issue online,  but without the proper protections, easy access to AI-powered image and video generation tools has made it possible for anyone to create compromising content using another person&#39;s likeness. This has become <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">a particular problem on X</a>, where the integration of Grok, the AI assistant created by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">X&#39;s parent company xAI</a>, makes it possible for anyone to turn the content of another person&#39;s post into an image-generating prompt. Over the last month, that&#39;s allowed users to create sexually explicit images of children, just by replying to a post with @grok and a request.&nbsp;</p><p>In response, Ofcom, the UK&#39;s media regulator, has already <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-regulator-ofcom-opens-a-formal-investigation-into-x-over-csam-scandal-120000312.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">opened an investigation into X</a> for potentially violating the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Online Safety Act</a>. The chatbot has also been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/grok-malaysia-indonesia-block-c7cb320327f259c4da35908e1269c225" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">outright blocked in Malaysia and Indonesia</a>. The DEFIANCE Act won&#39;t prevent Grok or other AI tools from generating nonconsensual deepfakes, but it would make creating or hosting that content potentially very expensive for anyone on the receiving end of a lawsuit.</p><p>The Senate passed <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3696/text" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">an earlier version</a> of the DEFIANCE Act in 2024, but it stalled in the House. Given the urgency of Grok&#39;s deepfake problem, the hope is this <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1837/text" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">new version of the bill</a> won&#39;t see the same resistance. Congress passed an earlier piece of deepfake regulation last year, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-will-sign-the-take-it-down-act-criminalizing-ai-deepfakes-today-184358916.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Take It Down Act</a>, with bipartisan support. That bill was focused on the companies who host nonconsensual, sexually explicit content, rather than the people exploited by it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/senate-passes-defiance-act-for-a-second-time-to-address-grok-deepfakes-212151712.html?src=rss]]></description>

As a consolation, the team is extending Season 1 through the start of the next season.</p><p>&quot;During our ongoing development, we&#39;ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,&quot; EA wrote in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post</a>.</p><p>The game came out of the gates hot following its October launch, selling over <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-copies-in-three-days-181826351.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">seven million copies over its first three days</a>. But recent Steam <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">reviews</a> provide a glimpse into the &quot;community feedback&quot; that sparked the delay. &quot;The Battle Pass is extremely predatory and very FOMO, while the season itself doesn&#39;t give a lot to offer,&quot; one <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SerryDartMan/recommended/2807960/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">review</a> with over 450 “helpful” votes said. They called out the title for having &quot;so much FOMO stuff that it becomes more stressful than fun.&quot;</p><p>The Season 1 extension will include some bonus content. The Frostfire Bonus Path will give “players the chance to unlock new free and premium customization rewards, including a Weapon Package and a Soldier Skin, as well as XP Boosts, by advancing through the tiers of the Frostfire Bonus Path.&quot; The extension update arrives on January 20.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-delays-battlefield-6-season-2-to-february-17-180306743.html?src=rss]]></description>

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from $160, while League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. We&#39;re almost halfway through the season at this point, so it makes sense for a service like League Pass to start offering some discounts.</p> 
<p>The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Last year, League Pass <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html">added multiview</a>, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.</p> 
<p>Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you follow Anthropic, you&#39;re probably familiar with Claude Code. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-is-letting-claude-ai-control-your-pc-181500127.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Since the fall of 2024</a>, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/blog/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRfApB7i3w$" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Claude Cowork</a>.</p><p>The company is billing Cowork as &quot;a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.&quot; After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. </p><p>Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that&#39;s easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" data-i13n="slk:Claude in Chrome;cpos:3;pos:1">Claude’s Chrome plugin</a> — and make can use Anthropic&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://claude.com/connectors" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Connectors framework</a> to access third-party apps like Canva. </p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&quot; However, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">does note</a> the system can &quot;take potentially destructive actions,&quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it&#39;s best to give &quot;very clear&quot; guidance to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">seemingly limited adoption</a>. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   </p><p>For now, Anthropic is giving users of its pricey <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Claude Max</a> subscription first access to the preview. If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you&#39;ll also need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. For everyone else, you’ll need to join a wait list. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-launches-claude-cowork-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000849.html?src=rss]]></description>

The savings vary depending on the bundle you configure, but this can bring your out-the-door cost down to $449 from $529 for the tablet, Marker stylus and polymer weave book folio.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="32a61bb483d845448bef30ead1f05118" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://remarkable.com/shop/black-friday"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html"><ins>best e-ink tablet</ins></a>. In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-tablet-e-ink-hands-on-review-marker-writing-note-taking-130044070.html"><ins>review</ins></a>, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable.</p> 
<p>The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn&#39;t think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless.</p> 
<p>The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges.</p> 
<p>The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet. The pricier tablet also has bundle deals right now with savings up to $80 depending on configuration.</p>

The company will refocus on developing wearables, like its recent batch of AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses, according to a memo from CTO Andrew Bosworth.</p><p>The news isn’t too surprising. Reality Labs has lost more than $70 billion since the beginning of 2021, and while Meta has done a solid job of delivering desirable consumer VR headsets and smart glasses, that business hasn’t been nearly profitable enough to justify the cost. And of course, Mark Zuckerberg’s huge gamble on the metaverse, which involved <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">renaming the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021,</a> has gone nowhere.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, Meta’s metaverse plans will now focus on mobile devices, which could mean a combination of its future wearables as well as existing mobile apps. “With the larger potential user base and the fastest growth rate today, we are shifting teams and resources almost exclusively to mobile to continue to accelerate adoption there,” Bosworth wrote in a memo to staff this morning.</p><p>Meta isn’t dumping its VR headset plans entirely, but according to Bosworth the VR divion will “operate as a leaner, flatter organization with a more focused road map to maximize long-term sustainability.” Basically, don’t expect a Quest 3 follow-up anytime soon.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html?src=rss]]></description>

Subscribers will get access to “premium content” in Pages, Keynote and Numbers (as well as in Freeform later this year). Of course, there are AI features too. Apple Creator Studio will be available starting on January 28 and you can try it out at no cost through a one-month free trial. </p><p>College students and educators can subscribe to Apple Creator Studio for $3 per month or $30 per year. Up to six people can access all of the plan’s features if one person in a Family Sharing group subscribes. </p><p>Apple noted that Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage will still be available as one-time purchases for Mac through the Mac App Store. Given that those can be pretty pricy (going up to $300 for Final Cut Pro), the subscription could be enticing to many burgeoning creators.</p><p>This seems like Apple’s attempt to muscle in on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-brings-photoshop-acrobat-and-adobe-express-to-chatgpt-130000389.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Adobe’s territory</a>, especially now that it’s bringing AI features to many of these apps. Adding new features to productivity apps like Numbers and Keynote means Apple’s taking a shot at the likes of Microsoft 365 Copilot (yeeeeah, that’s what Office is called now) and Google Workspace as well.</p><p>On Mac and iPad, Final Cut Pro has a new feature called Beat Detection. Apple suggests this makes “editing video to the rhythm of music fast and fun.” It uses an AI model from Logic Pro to analyze music tracks and display a Beat Grid. The idea here is to visualize song parts, beats and bars to help editors align their cuts with the music. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/final_cut.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/final_cut.jpg" style="height:1406px;width:1960px;" alt="The Montage Maker tool in Final Cut Pro on an iPad." data-uuid="80a9adfc-5659-4e7b-a8fc-1f898f9d479d"><figcaption>The Montage Maker tool in Final Cut Pro on an iPad.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>An AI-powered Montage Maker tool can stitch together “a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage.” You’ll be able to tweak these montages and use an Auto Crop tool to reframe the clip into a vertical format to make it a better fit for social media. Final Cut Pro has transcript and visual search functions too.</p><p>Logic Pro, MainStage, Pixelmator Pro (which is coming to iPad with Apple Pencil support) and Motion will all have AI-powered features as well. As you might expect, you’ll need an Apple Intelligence-capable device to use some of these.</p><p>Apple is also introducing something called the Content Hub. This media library includes “curated, high-quality photos, graphics and illustrations.” </p><p>As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, you’ll be able to access premium templates and themes in those otherwise-free apps with a Apple Creator Studio plan. Subscribers will be able to try beta versions of new features, such as a way to generate a draft of a Keynote presentation text based on an outline, and a Magic Fill tool to generate formulas and fill in tables in Numbers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-bundles-creative-apps-such-as-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-into-a-single-subscription-145210038.html?src=rss]]></description>

The system delivers enough power to handle heavy-duty air conditioners and other high-power appliances in the event of a blackout. It also claims that the E10 supports DIY-friendly installation thanks to the stackable, plug-and-play design.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Each Anker Solix E10 unit can deliver up to 37.2kW of surge power and stacking two boosts that to 66kW. It also comes with a &quot;turbo output&quot; mode that can output 10kW per unit for 90 minutes maximum. That level of power, along with the minimal 20ms auto-switch time (from grid to battery), means you may not even notice if the power grid goes down.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>For large installations, you can stack up to three E10 units to boost power to 90kWh, enough to provide whole home backup for up to 15 days (average US consumption is 30kWh per day so that might be stretching it). If that&#39;s not enough, you can add Anker&#39;s tri-fuel Solix Smart Generator 5500 that runs on gasoline, propane or natural gas and charges the E10 batteries via DC for maximum efficiency. The E10 can also handle up to 9kW of input from solar panels, or 27kW with three units.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Anker&#39;s Solix E10 can be purchased with several optional components. The Power Dock allows auto switching from grid power in the even of an outage in 20 milliseconds, while the Smart Inlet Box provides a manual switchover option. The latter lets you charge the E10 batteries from the grid with existing solar systems to save money.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the event of a wild storm, units are weatherproof thanks to the all-metal enclosures and can be operated in temperatures ranging from -4 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> 
<p>As for pricing, the Solix E10 costs $4,299 by itself, $4,599 with the Smart Inlet Box, $5,799 with the Solix Power Dock and $7,399 with the Solix Power Dock and Smart Generator. Adding an extra E10 unit would boost the latter price to around $10,000. However, Anker claims lower installation costs for the Solix E10 than Tesla and other manufacturers due to its modular nature and says it&#39;s so intuitive that some buyers could do a DIY installation.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have the best chance to save on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that&#39;s worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That&#39;s $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s 2026 Model Y is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#overview">now available</a> on the company&#39;s site and it comes with a new (and old) option:  a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.tesla.com/modely#premium">seven-seat version</a> via a third row. The extra seating costs $2,500 and is only available if you order the Premium All-Wheel-Drive Long Range model. Tesla first teased the option last year via an email to prospective buyers with the promise of &quot;seating for up to seven and enough room for everyone&#39;s gear,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/10/tesla-teases-new-model-y-7-seater-option/"><em>Electrek</em></a> reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new seats appear to be designed mainly for children as they don&#39;t offer much legroom, according to images on Tesla&#39;s configurator. Tesla notes that the seven-seat interior &quot;features fold-flat second-row and third-row seats,&quot; though it&#39;s not clear if those seats fold down electrically like the second row.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tesla is facing <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/02/business/tesla-byd-ev">increased competition</a>, especially in the crossover/SUV category, and saw another <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-03/tesla-loses-title-bestselling-ev-to-byd/106196066">sales decline</a> last quarter. The company previously sold a seven-seat version of the Model Y in the US for a short time before it was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-finally-launches-the-refreshed-2025-model-y-in-the-asia-pacific-region-133010038.html">refreshed </a>early last year. Since then, though, it has only been available with five seats. Tesla launched a six-seat &quot;Model YL&quot; version in China in August 2025 with a six-inch wheelbase extension that the US model lacks. Elon Musk said that model would come to the US market in late 2026 or maybe &quot;never.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, changes to the Model Y lineup are minor and confined to the Premium version. Those include a 20-inch dark-grey &quot;Helix&quot; &quot;wheel option, a new black headliner, a bigger, higher-resolution 16-inch display and darker rear badging.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-launches-a-seven-seat-version-of-the-2026-model-y-130039385.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company has informed workers at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm of a &quot;proposed organizational restructure&quot; that could affect around 55 roles across its two Swedish studios. Workers at Massive (the developer of The Division series, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/i-really-want-to-like-star-wars-outlaws-160032476.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a><em> </em>and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandoras-adventurous-spirit-might-just-win-you-over-160024430.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a>) were <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-laying-off-more-workers-and-offering-voluntary-buyouts-120030931.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">offered voluntary buyouts</a> late last year as part of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Ubisoft&#39;s ongoing cost-cutting efforts</a>.</p><p>&quot;This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,&quot; Ubisoft told <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>IGN</em></a> in a statement. &quot;These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries or the quality of the work produced by the teams.&quot;</p><p>Ubisoft claims that the &quot;long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged.&quot; Massive will continue working on projects that include <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-confirms-the-division-3-but-its-a-long-ways-off-190006878.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>The Division 3</em></a>. Ubisoft Stockholm, meanwhile, is beavering away on a new franchise that&#39;s still under wraps for now. That project is harnessing the studio&#39;s Ubisoft Scalar cloud computing tech, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-proposes-layoffs-at-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><em>Game Developer</em></a>.</p><p>Earlier in January, the company said it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">shutting down Ubisoft Halifax</a>, resulting in the loss of 71 jobs. Workers at that studio unionized just 16 days earlier. Ubisoft said its decision was part of &quot;company-wide actions to streamline operations.&quot;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-outlaws-developer-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm-face-layoffs-134234968.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>, the first new mainline entry in the series since 2021’s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, is just over a month away and Capcom is ready to share more details. The publisher will air a Resident Evil Showcase on January 15 at 5PM ET. You’ll be able to watch it on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Twitch</a> and YouTube (in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@residentevil/featured" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">English</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@biohazard" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Japanese</a>).</p><p>The stream will run for around 12 minutes. It will feature “all the latest info on <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>,” which will almost certainly include some gameplay ahead of it hitting PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-announced-at-summer-game-fest-2025-231136129.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">February 27</a>. Capcom might have more in store, though. An announcement for the showcase on the Resident Evil website states that, “Some of the <em>games</em> included in the show aren&#39;t suitable for children.”</p><p>That suggests the company will share details about other RE titles. It may just be a case of Capcom offering a reminder that it’s also bringing ports of <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/resident-evil-village-and-star-wars-outlaws-join-januarys-game-pass-additions-182500938.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Village</em></a> to Switch 2 on February 27. Still, there’s a chance we’ll hear news of more ports. There’s also the possibility that we get a glimpse of the next Resident Evil movie, a reboot of the series from <em>Barbarian</em> and <em>Weapons</em> filmmaker Zack Cregger that’s set to hit theaters in September.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="youtube.com" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-resident-evil-showcase-is-taking-place-on-january-15-133000548.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday this year.</p>

<p>AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Insta360, a company most known for its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x4-air-is-a-lightweight-8k-360-degree-camera-120017733.html"><ins>action cameras</ins></a>, has released two new AI-powered 4K webcams, the Link 2 Pro and Link 2C Pro, aimed at creators, educators and remote professionals. The company&#39;s goal with these models is &quot;a webcam experience that looks and sounds remarkably close to a professional camera and microphone setup.&quot;</p>
<p>Both models use a larger 1/1.3-inch sensor with dual native ISO for improved low-light performance over the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Insta360;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6d235168-35ce-4673-a834-52370a4dab1c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=19bef0e5-bb4e-4504-895b-778a3e59e7b9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Insta360&amp;linkText=previous+generation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YTM2MC5jb20vYmxvZy9uZXdzL2luc3RhMzYwLWFubm91bmNlcy1uZXctbGluay0yLWFuZC0yYy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxOWJlZjBlNS1iYjRlLTQ1MDQtODk1Yi03NzhhM2U1OWU3YjkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3RhMzYwLmNvbS9ibG9nL25ld3MvaW5zdGEzNjAtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1saW5rLTItYW5kLTJjLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdo9I5h_XMRBibC7w24D74qsTRfDeO8gaGoDeWegdSsF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insta360.com%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Finsta360-announces-new-link-2-and-2c.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.insta360.com/blog/news/insta360-announces-new-link-2-and-2c.html"><ins>previous generation</ins></a>, and both support HDR. Insta360 says the audio on both models leverages beamforming technology as well as AI noise canceling to help voices sound clearer in noisy environments. Users can choose from four pickup modes designed for different sound sources like &quot;Focus&quot; that isolates a single voice or &quot;Wide&quot; if there are multiple speakers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Video resolution on both models tops out 4K at 30 fps, and Insta360 says its updated True Focus system uses <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://photographylife.com/how-phase-detection-autofocus-works"><ins>phase-detection autofocus</ins></a> to lock onto subjects, keeping them in focus while they move. There&#39;s also a &quot;Natural Bokeh&quot; mode meant to mimic the shallow depth-of-field look of a traditional DSLR camera, for users who enjoy that look.</p>
<p>As for what sets them apart, the Link 2 Pro sports a 2-axis gimbal for AI-assisted tracking, which offers single or group-mode framing, while the Link 2C Pro is static and designed for fixed-position setups. Both models offer gesture control features, allowing users to control certain functions hands-free. These include starting or stopping tracking and zooming in or out. Both models also include a magnetic mount for easy placement on metal surfaces.</p>
<p>Several different modes are offered that aid in teaching and presenting. Among them are Smart Whiteboard mode, which will automatically detect a user&#39;s whiteboard and keep it clearly in frame, and DeskView mode, which captures an overhead view of a user&#39;s desk. There&#39;s also a green screen mode, a portrait mode and support for virtual backgrounds.</p>
<p>The new webcams also support Insta360 InSight, the company&#39;s subscription AI-powered meeting assistant. InSight can record meetings, generate transcripts, create summaries and more.</p>
<p>The Link 2 Pro will retail for $250 while the Link 2C Pro will go for $200.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple and Google have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html">confirmed</a> that Gemini’s models power the new version of Siri and other generative AI features. <em>CNBC</em> broke the news, but Apple and Google soon followed up with a lengthy joint statement. Here’s part of it: “Apple determined that Google’s Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models… Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading privacy standards.”</p>
<p>In June, it was reported that Apple was considering partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic for Siri (the voice assistant can currently tap ChatGPT for certain queries as part of Apple Intelligence). Two months later, Google emerged as a contender. Another report suggested Apple might build the new Siri using a custom version of Gemini — and that it would pay Google around $1 billion a year for the privilege. However, no official deal numbers were shared.</p>
<p>It’s also notable that current iPhones have direct access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But how long for?</p>

<p>Netflix’s hit show <em>Adolescence</em> received four awards, including best limited or anthology series. It also won best actor (Stephen Graham), supporting actor (Owen Cooper) and supporting actress (Erin Doherty) in a miniseries or television film.</p>
<p><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> — which my nieces refuse to stop talking about — won best animated feature and best original song. “I just want to say this award goes to people who have had doors closed on them, and I can confidently say rejection is redirection. So never give up.”</p>
<p>It’s not all good news. Netflix also won best performance in stand-up comedy on television for <em>Ricky Gervais: Mortality.</em> Apple and HBO Max each won three, and Hulu got one award on the night.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-the-agency-is-targeting-a-february-launch-date-for-artemis-2">The agency is targeting a February launch date for Artemis 2.</h3>
<h3 id="jump-link-"></h3>
<p>A few years ago, NASA announced it was pushing the Artemis 2 mission back to April 2026. The agency now says it could launch as early as February. NASA is finalizing preparations for the mission and will soon roll out the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft to the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts, who’ll test whether Orion’s critical life-support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer-duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the first three Lego-Pokémon kits are open now. One of the debut pocket monsters is, of course, Pikachu. You can build the 2,050-piece kit to show Pikachu either at rest or leaping out of an open Poké Ball into battle. It costs $200.</p>
<p>There’s also a 587-piece model of Eevee, for $60. On the bigger side is a set featuring a trio of Pokémon: Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise. This kit has 6,838 pieces and can show the group together in battle formation or separately in their own mini environments. It retails for $650 and is a bit much.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Proton’s latest update for <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/with-lumo-proton-thinks-it-can-carve-a-place-at-the-ai-table-130000740.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Lumo</a>, its privacy-focused chatbot, introduces a feature called Projects. It’s a dedicated and encrypted space for tasks that you know you’ll access again and again over an extended period of time, such as papers you’ll have to work on the whole semester or plans for a big trip you’re taking later this year. </p><p>Lumo will remember and keep all the information and all the files you upload for every project you create. Any document you upload or resources you add to the chat will sync across devices, so you don’t have to repeat yourself every time you access a task. Projects are also integrated with Proton Drive, allowing you to easily link documents and other files in your chats. </p><p>Proton says you can use the feature for just about any topic you want and give the chatbot tailored instructions for every project you create. It also said that each project is its own encrypted environment and that it will not use your chat histories to train AI models. To be clear, Lumo uses open source AI models, including Nemo, OpenHands 32B, OLMO 2 32B and Mistral Small 3. </p><p>The latest version of Lumo is now available to all users, but you’re only limited to one project if you’re on a free account. To be able to created an unlimited number of projects, you’ll have to subscribe to Lumo Plus, which costs $10 a month. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/protons-lumo-ai-chatbot-now-has-an-encrypted-space-for-your-projects-110000298.html?src=rss]]></description>

There are <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/why-does-amazon-need-five-tv-streamers-163014576.html">a lot</a> of streaming gadgets out there, all with different operating systems, memory capacities, video resolutions and bonus features, such as headphone connections and ambient modes that fill your screen with stills when you’re not watching. We tested options from the major brands and broke down exactly what each device gives you so you can pick the best streaming device for your TV.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-tv-streaming-device">What to look for in a TV streaming device</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-operating-system-and-interface"><strong>Operating system and interface</strong></h3> 
<p>Google’s TV Streamer, the Apple TV 4K, Amazon’s Fire TV Sticks and Roku devices are the most popular players in the space. Three of those brands also come built into TVs, such as Fire, Google and Roku TVs, but the Apple TV 4K doesn&#39;t come pre-loaded on any set. Each one has a unique operating system and interface. This may be the biggest deciding factor for many people, as it determines how the home entertainment you want to watch is arranged and presented. We go into detail for each platform below, but all of them come with home screens that, to varying degrees, gather your apps in one place, present the movies and TV shows you’re currently watching and give you suggestions of other media streaming options.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Nearly all streaming devices come with a remote that lets you search and do other operations using your voice, eliminating the need to hunt and peck at on-screen keyboards. They all offer “universal search,” in which searching for a title takes you to whichever app has it available. If you want to watch <em>Wicked</em> but don’t know where it’s playing, just push the voice button on the remote and say &quot;Wicked.” (We found simply saying the title or the genre you want sometimes works better than saying “Show me…” or “Search for…”) From the search results, hit the play button and the correct app will open and start playing — assuming you’ve previously logged into that app and, in most cases, have an active subscription.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity"><strong>Connectivity</strong></h3> 
<p>Most streaming sticks connect to the internet via Wi-Fi, with the majority of them supporting Wi-Fi 5 or 6 protocols. Set-top boxes can also have Ethernet ports, so you can hardwire your internet connection to the device, which is typically faster than wireless. Streaming media players connect to your TV through an HDMI port, and most sticks hide behind the screen, while set-top boxes sit on a surface nearby. Nearly all units also plug into an AC outlet for power. Some sticks used to work by pulling power from a USB port on the TV, but increasingly, these devices are designed to plug into the wall.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-video-and-audio-features"><strong>Video and audio features</strong></h3> 
<p>If your home theater setup has a screen that can display 4K content with Dolby Vision and HDR10, you’ll want a streaming device that supports those high-end formats. Of course, even the most top-shelf streamer can’t make a 1080p TV stream 4K. The series or movie also has to be transmitted in 4K and, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/legacy-hbo-max-ad-free-subscribers-will-lose-access-to-4k-streams-soon-092315829.html">increasingly</a>, companies restrict higher-quality streaming to more expensive subscription plans. In short, every element needs to support the video or audio feature, otherwise the highest quality you’ll get will be the lowest of any component in the chain.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-remotes">Remotes</h3> 
<p>Most remotes that come with streaming devices will allow you to control the power and volume of your TV. Some of the less expensive devices, however, don&#39;t have that feature, so you&#39;ll need to use your TV&#39;s remote control to turn it on, then use the streaming remote to navigate the streamer&#39;s interface. If your streamer&#39;s remote does offer power and volume controls, the setup process will usually calibrate your remote to your TV. If you want to use a soundbar, such as from Sonos or other brands, for audio you may also have to take the additional step of pairing your remote to the speaker.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-voice-control"><strong>Voice control</strong></h3> 
<p>In addition to helping you find stuff to watch, streaming devices from Apple, Google and Amazon can answer questions about the weather, sports scores and general facts using built-in voice assistants. They can also act as smart home controllers to turn off connected smart bulbs or plugs and show feeds from smart cameras. Just remember, as with all smart home devices, compatibility is key. Fire TV devices work with Alexa-enabled smart home equipment; the Google TV Streamer lets you control Google Home devices; and Apple TV 4Ks play nice with HomeKit and other Apple devices. Rokus grant power over Roku’s smart home products, but also work with the other ecosystems.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-tested-and-picked-the-best-streaming-devices"><strong>How we tested and picked the best streaming devices</strong></h2> 
<p>Like every gadget we test, we start by researching what’s worthy of reviewing. Then we get a hold of the devices ourselves and see how well they work. We don’t have a central Engadget lab; we test things in our own living rooms, on our own TV sets. We also figure that’s a better approximation of your own TV experience anyway.</p> 
<p>We began testing streaming devices as far back as 2007 with the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-03-24-apple-tv-the-first-24-hours.html">first Apple TV device</a>. Since then, we’ve tried out most of the major new releases to come along — from the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-04-rokus-new-streaming-stick.html">Roku Stick back in 2014</a> to the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/google-tv-streamer-review-a-great-side-piece-for-your-tv-with-a-dash-of-smart-home-chops-and-inessential-ai-160034550.html">2024 Google TV Streamer 4K</a>. A few years ago, we decided to compile the streaming devices we reviewed into this guide. Since then, we’ve updated our top picks using verdicts from our reviews, as well the testing we perform just for this guide. As new devices come out, we try them and, if something is worthy, we add it to our top picks on this list.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html?src=rss]]></description>

The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://frame.work/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300/configuration/new" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">current pricing</a> for machines is $1,139 for 32GB, $1,639 for 64GB or $2,459 for 128GB.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the company began altering its pricing structure last month, it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://frame.work/blog/updates-on-memory-pricing-and-navigating-the-volatile-memory-market" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">committed</a> to remaining transparent with customers about the changes happening to RAM prices. Framework also said it would reduce prices again once the market calms down. The original prices will be honored for any existing pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the big takeaways from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/all-the-tech-and-gadgets-announced-at-ces-2026-130124023.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">CES 2026</a> was that RAM is going to be <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">an expensive commodity</a> this year. The rising costs are largely in response to artificial intelligence projects, such as the rush to build data centers. As a result, buyers who take the modular approach may want to upgrade less costly components for better specs without making the increasingly hefty investment in memory. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-increases-desktop-prices-by-up-to-460-due-to-ram-crisis-234827145.html?src=rss]]></description>

If you were gifted (or gifted yourself) some new gear in December, make sure that you&#39;ve got the proper accessories to keep that gear performing at its best. If a new way to power all those batteries would be a benefit, Amazon&#39;s currently running a discount on an excellent wireless charging pad.

<p>This is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html"><ins>our top pick</ins></a> for a 3-in-1 charging pad thanks to its versatility. The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product. The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Before you leap to pre-order pages, however, here&#39;s a word of caution. In Lego form, our little friends look…kinda strange? I&#39;m not the biggest Lego builder, but I am a rather accomplished architect in <em>Minecraft</em>, so I am well aware of the innate challenge in constructing a rounded shape from square blocks. Take Pikachu, for instance. Part of his appeal is his chubby little cheeks. There are bricks with more rounded sides in this collection that hint at his usual rotundness, but the proportions of his face just feel a little off to me. I had the same reaction to the other figures as well, although Eevee seems to have fared a little better than the others. They&#39;re all sort of cute, but not nearly so cute as they are in other formats. But like I said, Lego is not my personal block of choice, so perhaps I&#39;m in the minority here! If you love these bricky pocket monsters, then roll on over to Lego&#39;s website and snap up these kits faster than a Mewtwo.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Dell killed off all of its PC brands</a>, including the iconic XPS lineup, and replaced them with a simplified naming scheme. It was a move meant to make it easier for people to discern between the company&#39;s many brands, but in reality, it just just made the company&#39;s lineup even more confusing. We called it an unforced error at the time, but after seeing how much Dell&#39;s PC market share fell over 2025, it&#39;s fair to say that rebranding was an absolute marketing disaster. </p><p>So, with its tail between its legs, Dell has returned to CES some welcome news for its fans: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">XPS lives</a>! And the company plans to double-down on the brand in ways it never did before. Today, Dell revealed the new XPS 14 and 16 notebooks, which feature a more practical design than the previous models. There&#39;s a new function row with traditional keys, instead of the odd capacitive buttons that disappeared in sunlight. And while the company is sticking with its &quot;invisible&quot; trackpad, which sits flush alongside the wrist rest, there&#39;s now a light border around the edges that lets you feel exactly where the trackpad begins and ends.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>So, in short, Dell seems to have solved most of our recent complaints about the XPS lineup. To signify its commitment to the brand, it&#39;s also emblazoning the XPS logo on all of these new machines, replacing the previous Dell name. That’s something I could never imagine a less humbled Dell doing. </p><p>The redesign also gave Dell room to shave off some weight and thickness from both machines. The XPS 14 weighs around three pounds now, a half-pound lighter than the previous generation, while the XPS 16 weighs 3.6 pounds, a whole pound lighter than before. The new cases make both machines look a lot more like Microsoft’s extra-subtle Surface Laptop, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Both systems are powered by Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 chips, and they also offer tandem OLED display options.</p><p>Dell also briefly teased the return of a new XPS 13 later this year, which is set to be the company’s thinnest and lightest notebook ever.  Dell says it’ll be cheaper than the XPS has been in the past.</p><p>The new XPS 14 and 16 will be available on January 6, starting at $2,050 and $2,200, respectively. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper prices with lower specs in February.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6/26, 12:30p: </strong>Pricing updated to reflecrt new numbers from Dell. Originally, we were told they would start at $1,650 and $1,850.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dell&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">XPS 14 currently costs over $2,000</a>. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.</p><p>Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months</a>, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung&#39;s marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-warns-of-price-hikes-as-rising-memory-costs-affect-all" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">told Bloomberg</a> at CES: &quot;There&#39;s going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it&#39;s going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.&quot;</p><p>At first, it appeared that Dell&#39;s new XPS 14 and XPS 16 were among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year&#39;s models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. At the moment, the XPS 14 starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper systems below $2,000 in February. While those prices haven’t been finalized, the reps say it should be similar to the earlier figures we were given.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that it didn&#39;t take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000. It’s just unfortunate that Dell doesn’t have cheaper configurations available for the launch if its new systems, especially since they look so compelling. Meanwhile, Apple still hasn&#39;t budged its $1,599  MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.</p><p>On the desktop front, AMD&#39;s David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company&#39;s AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.</p><p>&quot;I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,&quot; he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. &quot;Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there&#39;s a pretty big boost there.&quot;</p><p>McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD&#39;s business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no product that has memory in it that&#39;s immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it&#39;s doing to the market,&quot; he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. &quot;I think the, the truth is the volatility that we&#39;ve seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.&quot; </p><p>Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn&#39;t discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD&#39;s X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don&#39;t see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.</p><p>That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. </p><p>And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/#:~:text=Table_title:%20From%20NVIDIA%20Grace%20to%20Vera%E2%80%94scaling%20the,CPU:%20900GB/s%20%7C%20Vera%20CPU:%201.8TB/s%20%7C" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Vera Rubin AI supercomputer</a>, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2026/from-ces-2026-to-yottaflops-why-the-amd-keynote.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">new Helios AI rack</a>, which supports up to  31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.</p><p>Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.  </p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-provides-update-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders"><ins>letter to shareholders</ins></a> on Monday, Paramount CEO David Ellison said the company has filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking more disclosure about WBD’s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html"><ins>pending Netflix deal</ins></a> and the process that led to its acceptance. Paramount argues WBD hasn’t provided “basic information” shareholders need to evaluate competing offers, including how WBD valued the planned cable-networks spinout Discovery Global (or Global Networks, depending on the filing). The Netflix acquisition would leave Discovery Global to become its own publicly traded company, while the Paramount offer included these assets.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Paramount is also escalating the corporate pressure campaign, with Ellison saying it intends to nominate a slate of directors for election at WBD’s 2026 annual meeting. The end goal would be installing a board that would “engage” on <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-has-an-updated-warner-bros-discovery-bid-144348321.html"><ins>Paramount’s offer</ins></a> under the terms of WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix.</p>
<p>If WBD were to call a special meeting to approve the Netflix transaction before the annual meeting, Paramount says it will solicit proxy votes against the deal. It also plans to push a bylaw change requiring shareholders to approve any separation of Discovery Global. This change seems like Paramount stoking the flames (whether real or imagined) surrounding shareholders having their WBD shares bought out without the value of Discovery Global built-in under the Netflix merger.</p>
<p>Paramount remains convinced that its offer is &quot;superior&quot; to that of Netflix, while WBD <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_downloads/2026/FINAL-WBD-Amended-14D-9-Shareholder-Letter-01-07-25.pdf"><ins>maintains</ins></a> Paramount&#39;s bid offers &quot;insufficient value&quot; and that Paramount has failed to submit a true best proposal &quot;despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions.&quot; The lawsuit now aims to force WBD to spell out exactly how it arrived at recommending the Netflix deal over Paramount&#39;s bid.</p>
<p>WBD expressed concerns over whether a potential Paramount deal would even reach closing, citing the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:CNBC;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fad070cb-5a4c-45e5-9c06-30888ecfa6fa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;linkText=substantial+debt&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEyLzIyL3diZC1iaWQtcGFyYW1vdW50LWxhcnJ5LWVsbGlzb24tYmFja2luZy1iaWQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmFkMDcwY2ItNWE0Yy00NWU1LTljMDYtMzA4ODhlY2ZhNmZhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzEyLzIyL3diZC1iaWQtcGFyYW1vdW50LWxhcnJ5LWVsbGlzb24tYmFja2luZy1iaWQuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYHZetGP5lj4HiuQ7M9W6qZ3yMhZCBJ72entuOdipDuG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F12%2F22%2Fwbd-bid-paramount-larry-ellison-backing-bid.html" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/wbd-bid-paramount-larry-ellison-backing-bid.html"><ins>substantial debt</ins></a> the smaller studio would have to take on to pull off a leveraged buyout.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-wont-quit-files-suit-against-warner-bros-discovery-over-rejected-bid-175317166.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re looking to up your privacy game on the internet in the new year, you can do so for a little less than usual thanks to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">ExpressVPN&#39;s</a> latest deal. Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-180602243.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>India is considering new smartphone security rules that would require device makers to allow government access to source code for “vulnerability analysis.” It would also require companies to notify the government of major software updates and security patches before rollout, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/india-proposes-forcing-smartphone-makers-give-source-code-security-overhaul-2026-01-11/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a raft of unprecedented proposals by the Indian government under the guise of security, as it weighs making a package of 83 security standards drafted in 2023 legally binding in the world’s second-largest smartphone market with nearly 750 million smartphones.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the proposals, any source code review would be analyzed and potentially tested at designated labs in India. Major phone manufacturers have reportedly warned the Indian government that such a move risks revealing proprietary information.</p>
<p>The source code proposal comes alongside a series of additional recommendations such as restrictions on background permissions for apps and the option to remove all preinstalled apps. <em>Reuters</em> also reports the package would mandate periodic malware scanning and require phones to store system logs for at least 12 months, requirements that industry groups told the publication would drain battery life, run into storage limits and slow the rollout of necessary security updates.</p>
<p>The nation’s IT ministry told <em>Reuters</em> it &quot;refutes the statement&quot; that it is proposing manufacturers hand over their source code. This was despite a review of internal government and industry documents as part of the reporting. Government officials and industry executives are reportedly due to meet Tuesday for more discussions.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The start of the new year is a great time to get your finances in order, and a good budgeting app can help with that. Instead of laboring over a spreadsheet, you can try one of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">our favorite budgeting apps</a> for less than usual. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a> is running a sale that gives new users 50 percent off one year of the service, bringing the final cost down to just $50. Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.monarch.com/"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

<p>An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="8aca2207e5f4491d9059aabb74b07089" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18145289011"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>However, it&#39;s easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> 
<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren&#39;t enjoying the platform.</p>

<p>If you have an iPhone 16, iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-magsafe-charger-will-juice-up-the-iphone-16-faster-than-the-old-accessory-can-203435004.html">this cable can charge your device at 25W</a> as long as it&#39;s connected to a 30W power adapter on the other end.

With older iPhones, the charging speed tops out at 15W. The cable works with AirPods wireless charging cases too — it&#39;s certified for Qi2.2 and Qi charging.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

Normally retailing for $23, you can pick one up for $16.</p> 
<p>The TimeCapsule case uses two AA batteries to offer up to 14 times the lifespan of the CR2032 battery that powers an AirTag. The company based those estimates on Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, so your mileage may vary. Once an AirTag is seated inside the case, which is a compact 4.45 x 1.57 inches, it is sealed shut with four screws at the corners. The case is fiber-reinforced, according to Elevation Lab, and rated IP69 waterproof.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The company says it’s intended for use cases where you might place an AirTag for long periods of time, like in a vehicle, a piece of luggage or a work bag.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To comply with Australia&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/australia-is-adding-twitch-to-its-social-media-ban-for-children-202033276.html">under-16 social media ban</a>, Meta said on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://medium.com/meta-australia-policy-blog/update-on-metas-compliance-with-social-media-age-ban-law-7d811845db60">Medium</a> that it has shut down nearly 550,00 accounts. That number includes 330,000 Instagram, 173,000 Facebook and 40,000 Threads accounts deemed to belong to children. &quot;Ongoing compliance with the law will be a multi-layered process that we will continue to refine, though our concerns about determining age online without an industry standard remain,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&#39;s minimum age social media ban, the first of its kind in the world for a democracy, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/faqs#c-accordion--13765-content">went into effect</a> on December 10. The ten platforms affected, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X, Reddit and Twitch, must bar underage users or face a fine of up to $AUD 49.5 million ($33 million). Platforms are using a variety of means to determine age, including age inference based on activity and selfies.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some of those platforms aren&#39;t taking the ban lying down. Reddit, which launched a lawsuit against the Australian government, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-sues-australia-over-underage-social-media-ban-143018208.html">argued</a> that it shouldn&#39;t have been included in the ban since it isn&#39;t a social media site, while adding that it comes with some &quot;serious privacy and political expression issues&quot; for users.</p>
<p>Meta also expressed its opposition to the ban, citing a number of factors. It says taking social media out of the hands of teens can isolate them from getting support from online communities, and that the ban is only driving them to &quot;less regulated parts of the internet.&quot; It also sites inconsistent age verification methods and a lack of interest in compliance from teens and parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the fact that Meta has removed almost 550,000 accounts just a month after the ban took affect shows that it is also affecting the company&#39;s bottom line. And Meta doesn&#39;t have a sterling record when it comes to teen safety, having previously <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-whistleblower-tells-senate-the-company-cannot-be-trusted-with-our-children-185616936.html">downplayed</a> the frequency of harm to children.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-closes-550000-accounts-to-comply-with-australias-kids-social-media-ban-130041356.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK’s media regulator has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/ofcom-launches-investigation-into-x-over-grok-sexualised-imagery" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">opened a formal investigation</a> into X under the Online Safety Act. &quot;There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">used to create and share undressed images of people</a> — which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography — and sexualized images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material (CSAM),&quot; Ofcom said.</p><p>The investigation will focus on whether X has &quot;has complied with its duties to protect people in the UK from content that is illegal in the UK.&quot; That includes whether X is taking appropriate measures to prevent UK users from seeing &quot;priority&quot; illegal content, such as CSAM and non-consensual intimate images; if the platform is removing illegal content quickly after becoming aware of it; and whether X carried out an updated risk assessment before making &quot;any significant changes&quot; to the platform. The probe will also consider whether X assessed the risk that its platform poses to UK children and if it has ”highly effective <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-demands-adult-content-sites-introduce-effective-age-verification-methods-150057997.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">age assurance</a> to protect UK children from seeing pornography.”</p><p>The regulator said it contacted X on January 5 and received a response by its January 9 deadline. Ofcom is conducting an &quot;expedited assessment of available evidence as a matter of urgency&quot; and added that it has asked xAI for &quot;urgent clarification&quot; on the steps the company is taking to protect UK users.</p><p>&quot;Reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal non-consensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material on X have been deeply concerning,&quot; an Ofcom spokesperson said. &quot;Platforms must protect people in the UK from content that’s illegal in the UK, and we won’t hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there’s a risk of harm to children. We’ll progress this investigation as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process. As the UK’s independent online safety enforcement agency, it’s important we make sure our investigations are legally robust and fairly decided.&quot;</p><p>If Ofcom deems that a company has broken the law, it can &quot;require platforms to take specific steps to come into compliance or to remedy harm caused by the breach.&quot; The regulator can additionally impose fines of up to £18 million ($24.3 million) or 10 percent of &quot;qualifying&quot; worldwide revenue, whichever of the two figures is higher. It can also seek a court order to stop payment providers or advertisers from working with a platform, or to require internet service providers to block a site in the UK.

But as of Monday it was still possible for non-paying users to generate images through the Grok tab on the X website and app.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Malaysia and Indonesia became the first countries to block Grok, claiming that X’s chatbot does not have sufficient safeguards in place to prevent explicit AI-generated deepfakes of women and children from being created and disseminated on X. Indonesia temporarily blocked access to Grok on Saturday, as did Malaysia on Sunday, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/grok-malaysia-indonesia-block-c7cb320327f259c4da35908e1269c225" data-i13n="slk:Associated Press;cpos:8;pos:1"><em>Associated Press</em></a> reports.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The government sees non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the safety of citizens in the digital space,&quot; Indonesia’s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement. Officials in the country said initial findings showed that Grok lacks effective controls to prevent users from creating and sharing sexually explicit deepfakes based on photos of Indonesian residents. The country&#39;s director general of digital space supervision, Alexander Sabar, said generating deepfakes can violate individuals&#39; image and privacy rights when photos are shared or manipulated without consent, adding that they can lead to reputational, social and psychological harm.</p><p>The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission cited &quot;repeated misuse&quot; of Grok to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/08/grok-x-nonconsensual-images" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">generate explicit and non-consensual deepfakes</a>, some of which involved women and children. The regulator said Grok will remain blocked in the country until X Corp and parent xAI establish strong enough safeguards. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-regulator-ofcom-opens-a-formal-investigation-into-x-over-csam-scandal-120000312.html?src=rss]]></description>

These larger batteries have enough capacity to refill your computer to around 75 percent, giving you many more productive hours. Of course, they can also charge smaller devices like your phone, camera or tablet a few times over. Nearly all portable laptop chargers fall below the 100-watt-hour mark so you can bring them in your carry-on when you fly. Additional features, like built-in cables and digital displays make these battery banks easier to use, too. We tested over a dozen options and put our thoughts below, so you can find the best laptop power bank for your next trip away from an outlet.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-flying-with-a-laptop-power-bank"><strong>Flying with a laptop power bank</strong></h3> 
<p>Most portable batteries top out at around 27,000mAh so you can fly with them. The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">TSA currently limits</a> the capacity carry-on batteries to 100Wh, which works out to around 27,500mAh for 3.6 volt lithium-ion batteries. Note that you’re not allowed to pack <em>any</em> batteries in your checked luggage, regardless of capacity. The TSA rules are intended to limit fire danger — and some airlines are implementing further restrictions due to recent on-board incidents.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

A similar situation happened that same year in July on a domestic <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.the-independent.com/travel/delta-lithium-battery-explosion-b2785087.html">Delta flight, </a>and again in August on a transatlantic <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-smoke-plane-cabin-midflight-portable-phone-charger-fire/">KLM flight</a>. As a result, some airlines, including <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html">Emirates</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk">Southwest</a> and others have announced further restrictions on flying with battery packs.</p> 
<p>Rules include limiting the number of allowed portable chargers and requiring flyers to keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-capacity"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> 
<p>If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html">any of the best power banks will do</a>. But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh.</p> 
<p>If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away.</p> 
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank&#39;s specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy.</p> 
<p>Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-ports"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> 
<p>Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device <em>and</em> charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates.</p> 
<p>Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device.</p> 
<p>Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-wireless-charging"><strong>Wireless charging</strong></h3> 
<p>Since I first started testing portable power banks a few years ago, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups.</p> 
<p>Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design"><strong>Design</strong></h3> 
<p>All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-portable-laptop-chargers">How we test portable laptop chargers</h2> 
<p>For the past three years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html">other battery guide</a>. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher.</p>

</ul> 
<p>I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15 or 16), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled.</p> 
<p>For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That&#39;s when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN.</p> 
<p>For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design.</p> 
<p>For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</p></li> 
 <li><p>Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh</p></li> 
 <li><p>iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh</p></li> 
 <li><p>16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh</p></li>

The four USB-C ports can combine to output 245W of power and it got my MacBook Pro from nearly dead to 75 percent before depleting itself. When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself.</p> 
<p>But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-laptop-power-bank-faqs">Laptop power bank FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-laptop-power-banks-differ-from-phone-power-banks"><strong>How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks?</strong></h3> 
<p>The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-you-fast-charge-a-power-bank"><strong>How do you fast charge a power bank?</strong></h3> 
<p>You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-size-power-bank-do-i-need-for-a-laptop"><strong>What size power bank do I need for a laptop?</strong></h3> 
<p>Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-many-mah-to-charge-a-laptop"><strong>How many mAh to charge a laptop?</strong></h3> 
<p>A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop.</p> 
<p>Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Goal Zero;elmt:;cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=30d072b7-7973-41b4-a737-1ec377f5fbf6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Goal+Zero&amp;linkText=that+calculation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dvYWx6ZXJvLmNvbS9wYWdlcy93YXR0YWdlLWNhbGN1bGF0b3IiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb2FsemVyby5jb20vcGFnZXMvd2F0dGFnZS1jYWxjdWxhdG9yIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZAoNSNAK2PEx3aooXTpsHfiMd2Y4p7JIDJ0pgc2xQFm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgoalzero.com%2Fpages%2Fwattage-calculator" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://goalzero.com/pages/wattage-calculator">that calculation</a> takes voltage into account.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To further push the limits of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-agentic-ai-checkout-to-shopping-140000930.html">consumerism</a>, Google has launched a new open standard for agentic commerce that&#39;s called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/">Universal Commerce Protocol</a> (UCP). In brief, it&#39;s a framework that combines the power of AI agents and online shopping platforms to help customers buy more things.</p>
<p>Thanks to the introduction of UCP, Google is offering three new online shopping features. To start, Google&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-ai-mode-is-expanding-to-180-countries-and-adding-an-agentic-restaurant-finder-154833417.html">AI mode</a> will have a new checkout feature that allows customers to buy eligible products from certain US retailers within Google Search. Currently, this feature works with Google Pay, but it will soon add PayPal compatibility and incorporate more capabilities, like related product discovery and using loyalty points.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the merchant side, Google also established the Business Agent feature, which Google said will be &quot;a virtual sales associate that can answer product questions in a brand’s voice.&quot; The Business Agent will launch tomorrow with early adopters including Lowe’s, Michaels, Poshmark, Reebok and more. Also for retailers, the UCP is responsible for the new Direct Offers feature, which lets companies advertising with Google to &quot;present exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to buy, directly in AI Mode.&quot; The Direct Offers feature will work in tandem with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-starts-testing-ads-in-ai-mode-192800265.html">ads in AI Mode</a> that Google is testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With UCP, Google Search, retailers and payment processors are joining forces to make online shopping even easier, whether it&#39;s figuring out what product to buy, completing the purchase or offering &quot;post-purchase support.&quot; According to Google, UCP is compatible with existing industry protocols, like Agent2Agent, Agent Payment Protocols and Model Context Protocol. UCP was even co-developed with industry giants like Shopify, Etsy and Walmart, and was endorsed by even more companies in the commerce ecosystem, including Macy&#39;s, Stripe, Visa and more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/googles-new-commerce-framework-cranks-up-the-heat-on-agentic-shopping-212433122.html?src=rss]]></description>

Governor Gavin Newsom&#39;s proposed budget for 2026-2027, which was released on Friday, includes a &quot;light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) incentive program&quot; that details a one-time infusion of $200 million.</p>
<p>According to the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf">budget summary</a>, this incentive program is &quot;a critical part of the Administration&#39;s strategy to keep ZEVs affordable and accessible for all.&quot; The proposed budget still has to make it through the state&#39;s legislature later this year, but if passed, the new incentive would help continue the momentum of EV adoption across California. In the third quarter of 2025, the state saw almost <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/zero-emission-vehicle-and-infrastructure-statistics-collection/new-zev">30 percent</a> of auto sales being EVs, according to the California Energy Commission.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are no details in the budget summary outlining how exactly the $200 million would break down on a per-vehicle basis, but <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/shopping/2026/01/09/california-ev-tax-credit/88088676007/"><em>USA Today</em></a> reported that the rebate would be an &quot;on the hood&quot; instant discount for EVs. Previously, buyers would get up to $7,500 back in federal tax rebates on new EV purchases and up to $4,000 on used EVs. For California&#39;s proposed incentives, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, Lauren Sanchez, told <em>USA Today</em> that the state is still trying to figure out if it will offer tax credits for those who buy used EVs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/californias-governor-plans-to-set-aside-200-million-for-state-ev-tax-credits-194446449.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you received a bunch of password reset requests from Instagram recently, you&#39;re not alone. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malwarebytes.com/post/3mbywfybiil26">Malwarebytes</a>, an antivirus software company, initially reported that there was a data breach revealing the &quot;sensitive information&quot; of 17.5 million Instagram users. Malwarebytes added that the leak included Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and more. However, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/instagram/status/2010202301886238822?s=20">Instagram said</a> there was no breach and that user accounts were &quot;secure.&quot;</p>
<div id="8216e5e1a1644775bfbb6b8aba9e1f76"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people. There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure. <br><br>You can ignore those emails — sorry for any confusion.</p>— Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/2010202301886238822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>In Malwarebytes post, the company added that the &quot;data is available for sale on the dark web and can be abused by cybercriminals.&quot; Malwarebytes noted in an email to its customers that it discovered the breach during its routine dark web scan and that it&#39;s tied to a potential incident related to an Instagram API exposure from 2024.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reported breach has resulted in users receiving <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q93j15/instagram_data_leak_exposes_sensitive_info_of/">several</a> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1q8pcq1/is_someone_trying_to_hack_me/">emails</a> from Instagram about password reset requests. According to Malwarebytes, the leaked information could lead to more serious attacks, like phishing attempts or account takeovers. In response, Instagram posted on X that users can ignore the recent emails requesting password resets.</p>
<p>&quot;We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,&quot; Instagram&#39;s post on X read. &quot;There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure.&quot;</p>
<p>While Instagram said this isn&#39;t a data breach, its parent company has been in hot water for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-gdpr-data-breach-eu-fine-173528015.html">data breaches</a> in the past. If you haven&#39;t already, it&#39;s always a good idea to turn on two-factor authentication and change your password. Even better, you can review what devices are logged into your Instagram account in Meta&#39;s Accounts Center.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your neighborhood <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-gamestop-store-renovations.html">GameStop</a> might be on the chopping block, along with more than 400 other retail locations across the US. As first reported by <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/"><em>Polygon</em></a>, the retailer is pursuing a severe cost-saving measure by closing up several hundred physical locations. According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">blog</a> that keeps track of GameStop closures, there are 410 locations that are confirmed to be closing or are already closed, along with another 11 that are reportedly also on their way, as of January 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <em>Polygon</em> indicated, these closings aren&#39;t much of a surprise considering GameStop&#39;s SEC filing for December 2025 indicated that it would &quot;anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025,&quot; which ends on January 31, 2026. The same filing detailed that the company&#39;s board would pay out the GameStop CEO, Ryan Cohen, up to $35 billion in stock options, given that he increases the retailer&#39;s market cap to $100 billion.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the blog covers only closures in the US, the SEC filing also noted that GameStop is planning to reduce its presence in several other European countries and Canada. Even though GameStop saw a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-reddit-ceo-testify-house-gamestop-hearing-152845471.html">historic spike</a> in market value in 2021, it has struggled with the brand&#39;s direction, as seen with failed attempts at offering a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestops-nft-wallet-will-shut-down-in-november-164252057.html">crypto locker</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-axes-its-short-lived-nft-marketplace-as-it-retreats-from-crypto-215911813.html">an NFT marketplace</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gamestop-reportedly-shuts-down-more-than-400-us-stores-210632743.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo Switch 2 owners can forget about seeing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> in the Nintendo Store, at least as of now. In a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA</a>, Larian Studio&#39;s CEO, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6">Swen Vicke</a>, said that the team would have loved to bring the title to Switch 2, but &quot;it wasn&#39;t our decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>As cryptic as that may sound, Vicke&#39;s response hints that either Wizards of the Coast, which owns the Dungeons and Dragons IP that <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em> is set in, or Nintendo is behind the lack of a port. When it comes to Wizards of the Coast, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501?s=20">rumors</a> have circulated that the game studio and Wizards of the Coast may have a strained relationship.
