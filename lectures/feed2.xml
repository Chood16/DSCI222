You can still buy the vehicles as long as there are units to be sold, and Tesla promises to support them for as long as people have them. Once they’re gone, though, they’re gone for good, because Tesla is converting their production space in the company’s Fremont factory into a space for the manufacturing of Optimus humanoid robots.</p><p>Model S is Tesla’s second vehicle and has been in production since 2012, while the Model X SUV has been in production since 2015. Their shine has faded over the years, however, and the newer Model 3 and Y now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-says-it-delivered-a-record-18-million-evs-in-2023-082906995.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">make up the bulk</a> of the company’s sales. For the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">entirety of 2025,</a> for instance, Tesla delivered 1,585,279 Model 3 and Y vehicles but only sold 418,227 Model S and X units. The company also had to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-halts-model-s-and-x-sales-in-china-due-to-tariffs-185752814.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">stop selling</a> Model S and X in China in mid-2025, because they were being imported from the US and were subject to China’s tariffs that were put in place in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported goods. </p><p>In the call, Musk said that Tesla’s long-term goal is to be able to manufacture 1 million Optimus robots in the current Model S and X production space. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland a few days ago, the CEO announced that Tesla will <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-just-told-davos-that-tesla-will-sell-humanoid-robots-next-year-really-he-swears-192515568.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">start selling Optimus</a> to the public by the end of next year. Musk has big plans for Optimus and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/elon-musk-says-tesla-owners-can-text-and-drive-very-soon-042454805.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">once said</a> that it’s bound to become the “biggest product of all time,” bigger than cellphones, “bigger than anything.” But the humanoid robot has been failing to live up to the hype during demonstrations, and Musk is known for his overly optimistic timelines. </p><p>The company’s earnings report has also revealed that Tesla invested $2 billion in Musk’s other company, xAI. Tesla’s shareholders notably <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/tesla-shareholders-sue-musk-for-starting-competing-ai-company/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">sued Musk in 2024</a> for starting xAI, which they argued is a direct competition to the automaker. The CEO has been claiming for years, after all, that Tesla is an AI company and not just an EV-maker. Still, Tesla’s shareholders <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation-package-233217531.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">approved Musk’s $1 trillion</a> pay package in late 2025 on the condition that the company reaches a market value of $8.5 trillion. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-killing-off-its-model-s-and-x-cars-to-make-robots-010621101.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg says there&#39;s an end in sight to Reality Labs&#39; years of multibillion-dollar losses following the company&#39;s layoffs to the metaverse division earlier this year. The CEO said he expects to &quot;gradually reduce&quot; how much money the company is losing as it doubles down on AI glasses and shifts away from virtual reality.</p><p>Speaking during Meta&#39;s fourth-quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg was clear that the changes won&#39;t happen soon, but sounded optimistic about the division that lost more than $19 billion in 2025 alone. &quot;For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.&quot;</p><p>The company cut more than <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">1,000 employees</a> from Reality Labs earlier this month, shut down <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-has-closed-three-vr-studios-as-part-of-its-metaverse-cuts-202720670.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">three VR studios</a> and announced plans <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-closing-down-its-vr-meeting-rooms-as-part-of-its-wider-cull-140000422.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to retire</a> its app for VR meetings. Meta has also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">paused</a> plans for third-party Horizon OS headsets. Instead, Meta is doubling down on its smart glasses and and wearables business, which tie in more neatly to Zuckerberg&#39;s vision for creating AI &quot;<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">superintelligence</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>During the call, Zuckerberg noted that sales of Meta&#39;s smart glasses &quot;more than tripled&quot; in 2025, and hinted at bigger plans for AR glasses. &quot;They [AI glasses] are going to be able to see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you and help you as you go about your day and even show you information or generate custom UI right there in your vision,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zuckerberg has spent the last few years laying the groundwork <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-metaverse-is-getting-an-ai-makeover-194004996.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">for pivoting</a> Meta&#39;s metaverse work into AI.  He offered one example if what the means for Meta’s Horizon app.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You can imagine … people being able to easily, through a prompt, create a world or create a game, and be able to share that with people who they care about. And you see it in your feed, and you can jump right into it, and you can engage in it. And there are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that. And Horizon, I think fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that. </p><p>“But there&#39;s definitely a version of the future where, you know, any video that you see, you can, like, tap on and jump into it and, like, engage and kind of like, experience it in a more meaningful way. And I think that the investments that we&#39;ve done in both a lot of the virtual reality software and Horizon … are actually going to pair well with these AI advances to be able to bring some of those experiences to hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>One thing Zuckerberg didn’t mention, though: the word “metaverse.”</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Patreon creators will need to make some changes soon, thanks to Apple. On Wednesday, Patreon said Apple has renewed its requirement that all Patreon creators must move to subscription billing. The deadline to do so is November 1, 2026.</p><p>Patreon&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/apple-has-its-on-148395613" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">blog post</a> announcing the change made it clear that it had no other choice. &quot;We strongly disagree with this decision,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months.&quot;</p><p>Up to this point, Patreon’s billing model has operated in a gray area, allowing its creators to charge fans outside the App Store without paying Apple’s fees. When the issue first surfaced, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">described</a> it as stemming from how paid content was accessed (only some creators offered content that could be consumed in-app). On Wednesday, a Patreon representative described the gray area as being “because Apple’s In-App Purchase system doesn’t support some of Patreon’s longstanding billing models.”</p><p>But now Apple has reimposed its subscription mandate, eliminating the gray area. &quot;We know that Apple is serious about enforcing this mandate,&quot; Patreon wrote. &quot;Late last year, they blocked a Patreon app update and made it clear that in order to remain in the App Store, we have to comply with their billing requirement. Because millions of fans use iOS as their primary way to access Patreon and connect with creators, having our app blocked — or not available in the App Store at all — isn&#39;t an option.&quot;</p><p>Patreon’s &quot;whiplash&quot; description isn&#39;t hyperbole. Apple first announced the mandate in 2024. At that time, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/" data-i13n="slk:deadline;cpos:3;pos:1">deadline</a> for all Patreon creators to make the switch was set to November 2025 — one that Patreon grudgingly accepted. But according to the company, Apple told it last May that the original 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. Now, it appears to have reversed that again.</p><p>If there&#39;s a silver lining, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/apple-tells-patreon-to-move-creators-to-in-app-purchase-for-subscriptions-by-november/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">notes</a> that only 4 percent of Patreon creators are using the affected (legacy) billing models.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope have found a galaxy that is offering new data about the early stages of the universe&#39;s existence. The latest <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esawebb.org/news/weic2603/?lang" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">discovery</a> shared by astronomers is about a bright galaxy dubbed MoM-z14. According to the team, this galaxy existed 280 million years after the Big Bang.&nbsp;</p><p>The sounds like a long time, but in the context of the universe&#39;s estimated 13.8 billion years of existence, that&#39;s actually one of the closest examples astronomers have found to the Big Bang&#39;s occurrence. As a result, MoM-z14 can offer some insights and some surprises about what the early stages of the universe entailed.</p><p>&quot;With Webb, we are able to see farther than humans ever have before, and it looks nothing like what we predicted, which is both challenging and exciting,&quot; lead author Rohan Naidu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology said. The findings about this galaxy were published in the <em>Open Journal of Astrophysics</em>.</p><p>The scientists were able to date MoM-z14 with Webb&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nirspec/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> instrument, analyzing how light from the galaxy changed wavelengths as it traveled to reach the telescope. One of the initial questions sparked by this bright galaxy centers on the presence of nitrogen. Some early galaxies, including MoM-z14, have revealed higher nitrogen concentrations than scientists had projected was possible. Another topic of interest is about reionization, or the process of stars producing enough light or energy to permeate the dense hydrogen fog that existed in the early universe.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s an incredibly exciting time, with Webb revealing the early Universe like never before and showing us how much there still is to discover” said Pennsylvania State University graduate student and team member Yijia Li.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-share-new-insights-about-the-early-universe-via-the-webb-space-telescope-213311848.html?src=rss]]></description>

After claiming them, these games will stay in your library as long as your PS Plus plan remains active.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Undisputed</em> (PS5) is a 2024 boxing game with dozens of licensed fighters across several weight classes.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Music hardware and software manufacturer Native Instruments has entered into preliminary insolvency proceedings, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://cdm.link/ni-insolvency/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Create Digital Music</ins></em></a>. This is the company behind iconic software like Massive, Traktor and Kontakt and hardware like Maschine+. Native Instruments also owns the brands iZotope, Brainworx and Plugin Alliance.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have many specifics as to what this entails and what the future of the company will look like. We do know that an administrator has been appointed to handle restructuring and, potentially, to sell off existing assets. Native Instruments employs hundreds of people and their fates also remain uncertain.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A private equity firm called Francisco Partners owns a majority stake in the company. It also owns majority stakes in entities like GoodRX and Verifone, among others. This isn&#39;t the first time Native Instruments has been forced into major restructuring. The company experienced plenty of layoffs and uncertainty <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://djtechtools.com/2019/09/03/shakeups-layoffs-whats-happening-at-native-instruments/"><ins>between 2019 and 2020</ins></a> before being purchased by private equity.</p>
<p>Again, we have no idea how this will shake out. It&#39;s possible that new investors will jump on board and it goes back to business as usual. It&#39;s also possible everything will be scrapped for parts and sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<div id="4228f96c81d74b0e81b38b14f5daa828"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Plugin Alliance, with entities in the US and Germany, says there&#39;s no immediate impact of the NI insolvency on them. <a href="https://t.co/u6smg1X0t4">https://t.co/u6smg1X0t4</a> <a href="https://t.co/ok7BRwo3BU">pic.twitter.com/ok7BRwo3BU</a></p>— cdmblogs (@cdmblogs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdmblogs/status/2016499892064014356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote>

<p>We do know that subsidiary Plugin Alliance seems to be unaffected. It issued a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.gearnews.com/native-instruments-insolvency/">statement on Facebook</a> saying that it isn&#39;t involved with the proceedings and that operations will continue as normal. This means new plugins will be released, along with updates for current software.</p>
<p>Everything else is still up in the air. This is troubling for those who have heavily invested in the company&#39;s ecosystem of products. I&#39;m one of them. Any hope I had for a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/maschine-plus-native-instruments-virtual-instruments-groovebox-155725975.html"><ins>hardware refresh of the Maschine+</ins></a> just went out the window.</p>

<p>If the company&#39;s robust line of software goes up for sale, Akai is likely the best bet.

Starting today, a host of new features are rolling out for the browser, with more to come over the next few months.&nbsp;</p><p>The first of the new features is a sidebar. Available to all <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-in-chrome-no-longer-requires-a-subscription-170045611.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Gemini in Chrome users</a>, the interface allows you to chat with Gemini and keep a conversation going across multiple tabs. Google suggests the sidebar is useful for multitaskers.&nbsp;&quot;Our testers have been using it for all sorts of things: comparing options across too-many-tabs, summarizing product reviews across different sites, and helping find time for events in even the most chaotic of calendars,&quot; the company writes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_Chrome_Nano_Banana_Room_Design_%281%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_Chrome_Nano_Banana_Room_Design_%281%29.gif" style="height:1150px;width:2000px;" alt="Now you can access Nano Banana, Google&#39;s in-house image generator, directly from Chrome. No need to go to the Gemini app." data-uuid="47784ede-fc6d-426d-a0e6-a10aaf5c7ad4"/><figcaption>Now you can access Nano Banana, Google&#39;s in-house image generator, directly from Chrome. No need to go to the Gemini app.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The sidebar is also where you access the second new feature Google is adding to Chrome. Following its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">successful rollout within the Gemini app</a>, Nano Banana, Google&#39;s in-house image generator, is available directly inside of the browser. With the addition, you won&#39;t need to open a new tab when you want Gemini to make you an AI image. You also won&#39;t need to download and upload a file when you want Gemini to edit an existing image for you. Instead, you can complete both of those tasks from any of your open tabs, thanks to the new sidebar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward, Google plans to bring Personal Intelligence, which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-pull-context-the-rest-of-your-google-apps-if-you-let-it-160039468.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">debuted inside of the Gemini app at the start of January</a>, to Chrome in the coming months. Once the feature arrives, it will allow the browser to remember past conversations you&#39;ve had with Gemini. In turn, Google says this will lead to a more personalized Chrome. &quot;Personal Intelligence in Chrome transforms the browsing experience from a general purpose tool into a trusted partner that understands you and provides relevant, proactive, and context-aware assistance,&quot; the company said. </p><p>In the meantime, Gemini in Chrome already supports Google&#39;s Connected Apps feature, which allows the assistant to pull information from the company&#39;s other services, including Gmail and Calendar. During a press briefing, a Google employee demoed this feature by asking Gemini to pull up the dates of when their children would be on March break. Without telling the assistant where to look, Gemini sourced the correct time frame from the employee&#39;s email inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_apartment_hunting_with_Redfin_%281%29.gif" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Animation_apartment_hunting_with_Redfin_%281%29.gif" style="height:650px;width:1000px;" alt="A new sidebar interface allows Chrome users to access Gemini from any of their open tabs." data-uuid="62c08ab8-231e-417f-990c-b07e5ec8161e"/><figcaption>A new sidebar interface allows Chrome users to access Gemini from any of their open tabs.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Last but not least, Google is previewing a new auto browse feature inside of Chrome. In the demo the company showed, an employee asked Gemini to find and buy them the same winter jacket they bought a few seasons ago. The assistant first drafted a plan outlining how best to tackle the request. It reasoned the best place to start was with a search of the employee&#39;s email inbox to determine the correct model and size of jacket.&nbsp;It then went shopping. </p><p>While Gemini was working on this task, the employee was free to continue browsing in Chrome. At several points in the process, the assistant would stop before continuing to obtain the employee&#39;s permission to move forward. For instance, it paused when it needed  login credentials, and again when it needed a credit card number to complete the purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>Judging from the demo, it will probably take you less time to do your online shopping and other browser tasks on your own. Google suggests the feature will appeal to those who are creatures of habit. Say you often order the same produce from a grocery delivery service every week, Gemini can automate the ordering. Plus, the feature is in preview, so early testers probably won&#39;t be too put off by Gemini&#39;s slow pace. In any case, Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US can try auto browse starting today. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-brings-its-nano-banana-image-generator-to-chrome-180000104.html?src=rss]]></description>

Given the state of the industry, &quot;Do I want to support this company?&quot; is arguably more important. Take, for example, Ubisoft, where things seem to unravel more each day. After the floundering publisher floated even more layoffs this week, workers at its Paris headquarters said, &quot;Enough is enough.&quot; They&#39;re now <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-worker-unions-reportedly-vote-to-strike-as-publisher-proposes-200-voluntary-redundancies" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">calling</a> for a three-day strike.</p><p>Unions representing Ubisoft employees plan to strike from February 10 to 12. &quot;With management being stubbornly entrenched in its authoritarian ways, we are calling Ubisoft employees across France to join this strike, along with the five unions present within the company,&quot; The Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (Video Game Worker&#39;s Union) wrote in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mdiakvmbbd26" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">statement</a>.</p><p>The strike follows a series of heavy-handed cost-cutting moves at Ubisoft. It recently shut down its Halifax studio just <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">16 days after employees unionized</a>. Last week, it closed its Stockholm studio and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">announced additional restructuring efforts</a> worldwide. It also <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-among-six-games-canceled-by-ubisoft-175801132.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">canceled six games and delayed seven others</a>.</p><p>Then, earlier this week, the Assassin&#39;s Creed publisher <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">proposed cutting 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters</a>. Under French labor law, the company would organize the cuts through the nation&#39;s Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process. It would require a mutual agreement between the company and the labor union.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/6c862987-5c56-4c3e-b1a6-7003187d3e5e" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/6c862987-5c56-4c3e-b1a6-7003187d3e5e" style="height:3350px;width:5026px;" alt="Yves Guillemot, CEO and co-founder of Ubisoft, speaks at the Ubisoft Forward livestream event in Los Angeles, California, on June 12, 2023.

(The company had previously agreed to two work-from-home days per week.) Although Ubisoft framed the mandate as being about efficiency and collaboration, it&#39;s easy to view this as a cudgel to further reduce its headcount. One Ubisoft developer, who hinted as much while voicing his opposition to the mandate on LinkedIn, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-punishes-developer-union-strike-return-to-office-2000663771" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">said</a> he was suspended without pay for three days as a punitive measure.</p><p>The workers&#39; union saw all of this and decided it was time to act. &quot;We&#39;re calling for a HALT to management&#39;s obsession with penny-pinching and worsening our working conditions,&quot; the Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo wrote. &quot;It&#39;s time for a real accountability from company executives, starting from the top! Without the workers, and generous public funding, Ubisoft would never have been able to grow this much. WE are Ubisoft, and WE are shutting it down February 10th to 12th!&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-173241918.html?src=rss]]></description>

Despite its high-achieving free plan, it didn&#39;t quite make my list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">best VPNs</a>, largely due to alienating interface choices and swingy download speeds. Its iconoclastic approach to everything from design to pricing to its online knowledge base will likely win some customers for life and turn others off.</p><p>For those in the latter camp, I&#39;ve written up this guide for cancelling Windscribe. Follow the instructions below to stop Windscribe from auto-renewing, cancel third-party subscriptions, delete your account altogether and get a refund.</p><p>The most important thing to know before we start is that Windscribe&#39;s money-back guarantee only lasts seven days — if you paid for a subscription, you have to cancel before then to get a refund.

Here are the steps to follow.</p><ol><li><p>In your browser, navigate to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://windscribe.com" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">windscribe.com</a></a><strong>.</strong> Click the words <strong>My Account </strong>at the top of the home page.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down to the billing section<strong>.</strong> On the subscription<strong> </strong>line, click the button marked <strong>Cancel Subscription.</strong></p></li><li><p>You&#39;ll be taken to a new page.

Tap <strong>Payments &amp; Subscriptions </strong>in the menu that appears, then <strong>subscriptions </strong>on the next page.

To do this, go to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://windscribe.com" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">windscribe.com</a></a> and click the <strong>My Account </strong>button in the header bar. Scroll all the way to the bottom and click on the obnoxiously titled <strong>Give Up On Privacy </strong>button. This will show you the following image.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_delete_account.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_delete_account.png" style="height:1636px;width:958px;" alt="I realize I&#39;m harping on this, but Windscribe gets exceptionally punchable when you try to delete your account." data-uuid="00e0d58c-33bc-4705-8e56-6b1ba7b64037"/><figcaption>I realize I&#39;m harping on this, but Windscribe gets exceptionally punchable when you try to delete your account.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>You&#39;ll have to fight through several attempts at comedy to finish deleting your account. Click <strong>Yes </strong>or <strong>No </strong>when asked if you ever question your life choices. Enter your password, write whatever you want as a cancellation reason and check both of the boxes below the text field. The <strong>Delete Account </strong>button should finally be clickable; do it. Once you&#39;ve pulled the trigger, you won&#39;t be able to use the same email address to sign up for another account.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-windscribe"><strong>How to get a refund from Windscribe</strong></h2><p>As I warned above, you can only get a refund from Windscribe for seven days after paying for a subscription. You also cannot get your money back if you&#39;ve used more than 10GB of data since the start of the payment period. Finally, you can only get refunded on the first payment of each subscription — renewals are not eligible.</p><p>If you&#39;re within those limits, you can request your money back by starting a conversation with the Garry chatbot. Click the chatbot icon at the bottom-right of the Windscribe website to start a chat. Be warned that you might have to stand firm through several attempts to fix your complaints before you can actually initiate the refund process.</p><h2 id="jump-link-best-windscribe-alternatives"><strong>Best Windscribe alternatives</strong></h2><p>Windscribe is a VPN with a lot of good points. That said, by the time you&#39;ve waded through a swamp of dick jokes to complete the process, I wouldn&#39;t blame you for feeling validated in your decision to get rid of it.</p><p>There are plenty of good VPNs that can replace Windscribe. My favorite is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>, which also has a free plan, though without the ability to select your own server. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> is simple and powerful, if a little overpriced, while <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Surfshark</a> is the fastest VPN overall.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ExpressVPN is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $101 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.59 for the promo period.</p> 
<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> 
<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-180602104.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It&#39;s easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it&#39;s all styrofoam under the hood.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>I built this list of the best VPNs <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html">after intensive testing</a> to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can&#39;t go too far wrong. If you&#39;re interested in a service you can use without paying, head over to my list of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html">the best free VPNs</a> — and if you&#39;re willing to pay but want to save money, I keep a list of the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html">best VPN deals</a> updated weekly.</p> 
<p>For each VPN on this list, I&#39;ve shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I&#39;ll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Editor&#39;s note:</em></strong><em> This list is up-to-date as of January 2026. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors.</em></p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested">Other VPNs we tested</h2> 
<p>The VPNs in this section didn&#39;t crack our top list above, but we&#39;re summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-windscribe"><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a></h3> 
<p>Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former&#39;s no-nonsense privacy and the latter&#39;s healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe&#39;s server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We&#39;ve just published a full <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/windscribe-review-despite-the-annoyances-it-has-the-right-idea-120000837.html">Windscribe review</a> that can tell you more.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Windscribe didn&#39;t copy the most important part of Proton VPN&#39;s free plan — the unlimited data. You&#39;re only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn&#39;t enough for regular streaming. It&#39;s also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-private-internet-access"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:private internet access;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=private+internet+access&amp;linkText=Private+Internet+Access&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb2xZhJgbuYJ1Fdt6xW-K50AZouRlBZmdjdZsNQwkI8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h3> 
<p>Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it&#39;s a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won&#39;t see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.</p> 
<p>PIA&#39;s apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html">PIA VPN review</a>.</p> 
<p>The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA&#39;s apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren&#39;t directly reflected in the speed tests. It&#39;s also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it&#39;s heavily bulked out by virtual locations.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tunnelbear"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TunnelBear;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1c695770-3d23-4adf-9f4f-c595e9124f3b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TunnelBear&amp;linkText=TunnelBear&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50dW5uZWxiZWFyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHVubmVsYmVhci5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf8ppijmDasdwSbx3TDdJhiNJpdlhr12X984m16VE9oW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tunnelbear.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a></h3> 
<p>TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it&#39;s far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-vyprvpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:VyprVPN;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1ac8eebf-61d7-4584-9f21-7053ac17ead1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=VyprVPN&amp;linkText=VyprVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52eXBydnBuLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkOTE1MDhiLWJiZTEtNDRlOC1hNzE2LTAyNzI0Y2JjYTNhYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudnlwcnZwbi5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATWG0NqEJnfLwacpOW9Xap1dcDWgI9JL41k8O7ZSdLor&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vyprvpn.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.vyprvpn.com/">VyprVPN</a></h3> 
<p>VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn&#39;t crack the VPN encryption itself). It&#39;s also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.</p> 
<p>Despite all that, it didn&#39;t make the top seven because its connection speeds aren&#39;t up to scratch — you&#39;ll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-norton-vpn"><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Norton;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ad91508b-bbe1-44e8-a716-02724cbca3ac&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=Norton+VPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbm9ydG9uLXZwbiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYPIEO6h3lxyQPHmfQqYrjD_6ph4qfFJfWMpovWQMg6e&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorton-vpn" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://us.norton.com/products/norton-vpn">Norton VPN</a></h3> 
<p>Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It&#39;s a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.</p> 
<p>This isn&#39;t to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won&#39;t find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2> 
<p>Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We&#39;re here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html">how to tell if your VPN is working</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren&#39;t always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="http://speedtest.net/">Ookla&#39;s speedtest.net</a>). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it&#39;s actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it&#39;s using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.</p> 
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Do some outside research into the VPN&#39;s origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It&#39;s a dealbreaker if you can&#39;t figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.</p> 
<p><strong>Server network: </strong>Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you&#39;ll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it&#39;s available at convenient times in your timezone.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you&#39;re comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vpn-faqs">VPN FAQs</h2> 
<p>To wrap up, let&#39;s answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don&#39;t cover here.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3> 
<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we&#39;re talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.</p> 
<p>Whenever you get online, you&#39;re assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it&#39;s possible to create a record of what an individual does online.</p> 
<p>When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN&#39;s servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won&#39;t trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN&#39;s IP address, not yours. If you&#39;re interested in more detail, I&#39;ve written a whole article on <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">how a VPN works</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-are-some-things-vpns-are-used-for">What are some things VPNs are used for?</h3> 
<p>The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.</p> 
<p>One side effect of borrowing a VPN&#39;s IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.</p> 
<p>Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as <a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html">certain US states</a> or countries — like <a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html">the UK</a> — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn&#39;t blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN&#39;s homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn&#39;t mean that authorities can&#39;t detect that it&#39;s being used in a given location.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-worth-it">Are VPNs worth it?</h3> 
<p>Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It&#39;s no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.</p> 
<p>With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-information-does-a-vpn-hide">What information does a VPN hide?</h3> 
<p>A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.</p> 
<p>However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there&#39;s nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you&#39;re using a VPN.</p> 
<p>A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can&#39;t do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that&#39;s concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-vpns-safe">Are VPNs safe?</h3> 
<p>As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there&#39;s very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before.</p> 
<p>All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all <a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html">secretly working off the same backend</a>. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-can-you-get-a-vpn-on-your-phone">Can you get a VPN on your phone?</h3> 
<p>Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and <a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html">mobile devices</a>. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you&#39;re free to choose whichever provider you like.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-googles-one-vpn">What about Google&#39;s One VPN?</h3> 
<p>Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you&#39;re a Google Fi subscriber.</p> 
<p>That said, I don&#39;t recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-to-pay-30-million-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-childrens-privacy-193903510.html">one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy</a>. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to guard your sensitive information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss]]></description>

The web app is intended for quick adjustments when away from home, such as LANs or tournaments, where downloading the full desktop version may not be possible or practical.</p>
<p>At launch, Synapse Web will only support the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards, though Razer says more devices will be added down the line. Using any Chromium-based browser, users can make quick changes to key settings, apply Chroma RGB quick effects and manage on-board profiles. These profiles can then be viewed, edited and saved directly to the keyboard’s device memory, so the configuration stays consistent when moving between PCs.</p>

But, first, it's important to get this out of the way: The new AirTag still doesn't have a keyring hole, so you'll still need <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">accessories like a case, holder or secure pocket</a>.</p><p>Once you get over that, the new Apple AirTag does offer some nice improvements. For starters, it's now powered by Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip — the same one used in the iPhone 17 lineup and for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It also uses <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html" data-i13n="slk:Precision Finding;cpos:3;pos:1">Precision Finding</a> to reach items up to 50 percent further away than the previous AirTag model. This feature will now work with any Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 or a later iteration of either.&nbsp;That means the directional guidance that shows you down to a few feet where your AirTags are will be available on those compatible watches in addition to your iPhone. </p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a0306be0-fac3-11f0-bf75-60455910936b" data-crop-orig-src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a0306be0-fac3-11f0-bf75-60455910936b" style="height:2400px;width:1971px;" alt="New AirTag." data-uuid="7fba2953-2396-3df0-b034-b3d1c21e0088"><figcaption>New AirTag.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The new AirTag is also 50 percent louder than before and has what Apple calls a "distinctive new chime."

Most of the holiday deals are over by now, but plenty of services are still offering excellent prices. With access to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a>, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and any advertisers it may sell that data to — all while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from all across the globe.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html">using a VPN</a>, but if you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to mistakenly end up paying more than you want to, as otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even with all those caveats, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

The company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-unveils-new-gaming-and-prestige-business-laptops-at-ces-2026-230000027.html">unveiled</a> its next-generation business laptop at CES earlier this month, all of them powered by the latest <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html">Intel Core Ultra Series 3</a> processors.</p>

In more real-world terms, if you’re on a work trip and know you won’t always have a power supply to hand, you can trust one of these to get you through a day of heavy multi-tasking.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Prestige models are encased in full aluminum and are slimmer than their predecessors. They feature vapor chamber cooling and dual-fan architecture to ensure they stay cool and quiet while you work. If you pick up one of the convertible 2-in-1 Flip models, you can work with a stylus too.</p>
<p>There’s a 2.8K OLED display option for the Prestige 16 and 16 Flip, with support for VRR and DisplayHDR True Black 1000. The Flip 14 keeps the OLED, but the resolution drops to FHD+ and you lose the VRR.</p>

While the teams playing in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-watch-the-2026-super-bowl-patriots-vs-seahawks-channel-where-to-stream-and-more-173222330.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Super Bowl 2026</a> are the true stars of the show (and <a target="_blank" rel="" class="link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/article/super-bowl-weekend-musical-lineup-bad-bunny-green-day-olivia-dean-and-post-malone-are-all-set-to-perform-195657927.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Bad Bunny</a>, of course), your TV is a pretty important part of the puzzle of putting together an excellent Super Bowl party. Maybe you’ve been thinking about replacing an aging set, or you’re itching for a full refresh of your <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-best-gear-to-upgrade-your-home-theater-setup-130000755.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">home theater setup</a> — either way, you’ll want to try to get a good deal on a new TV. Thankfully, the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl can be a great time to shop for a new TV.<br><br>Generally, TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. Some 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are forthcoming things year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, now is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV. Here, we’ve curated the best Super Bowl TV deals we could find this year, from already affordable sets discounted even further to high-end OLEDs that are hundreds of dollars off.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-for-less-than-500">Super Bowl 2026 TV deals for less than $500</h2>
<p>You can easily find solid 1080p and 4K TV sets within this budget-friendly price range. What you’ll be more limited in is size — most TV deals under $500 we’re seeing right now are on sets up to 55 inches. There are a few 65- and 75-inch models in there, but the pickings are slim.</p>

That&#39;s a 50 percent discount on the service&#39;s normal $100 price.</p> 
<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> 
<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p>

It’s officially available starting January 28, and includes a one-month free trial. The key shift is that some of these apps are now subscription-only on iPad, even as Apple continues to offer one-time purchases on the Mac – albeit with slightly different feature offerings. Here’s everything you need to know about Apple Creator Studio and the programs it includes.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-apple-creator-studio-includes">What Apple Creator Studio includes</h2>
<p>At its core, Apple Creator Studio gives subscribers access to Apple’s professional video, music and imaging apps. The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-bundles-creative-apps-such-as-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-into-a-single-subscription-145210038.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">bundle includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage</a>. Pixelmator Pro (which <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-is-buying-the-developer-of-one-of-the-iphones-best-photo-editing-apps-165853866.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Apple acquired in late 2024</a>) is also coming to iPad for the first time, with a touch-optimized interface and Apple Pencil support.</p>
<p>A Creator Studio subscription also unlocks premium content and features inside Apple’s productivity apps. Keynote, Pages and Numbers remain free, but subscribers get access to premium templates and themes, plus a new Content Hub with Apple-curated photos, graphics and illustrations. Similar paid features are coming to Freeform later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>Apple is also using the bundle to introduce new “intelligence” features across several apps. In Final Cut Pro, the new Beat Detection feature can analyze a music track and show a beat grid so you can line edits up to the rhythm. The app is also getting tools like transcript search and visual search designed to make it easier to find moments across footage.</p>
<p>Logic Pro is gaining new AI-assisted Session Players and workflow features on Mac and iPad. Pixelmator Pro continues to rely heavily on machine learning for tasks like background removal, image repair and image upscaling. Note that some of these features require an Apple Intelligence-capable device.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-which-devices-are-supported">Which devices are supported</h2>
<p>Apple Creator Studio works across multiple Apple platforms, though not every app is available everywhere.</p>
<p>On the Mac, subscribers get access to all six apps: Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage.</p>
<p>On the iPad, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro are included. Motion, Compressor and MainStage remain Mac-only.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, Creator Studio does not include full versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro or Pixelmator Pro. Instead, it unlocks premium features and content inside Keynote, Pages and Numbers, and eventually Freeform.</p>
<p>Apple says the best experience is on macOS 26, iPadOS 26 and iOS 26 or later, with individual app requirements varying by device and chip.&nbsp;</p>

College students and educators get a steep discount: the education plan costs $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year, and it also comes with a one-month free trial.</p>
<p>A standard subscription can be shared with up to five other people using Family Sharing, allowing six users total. Education subscriptions are limited to individual use and cannot be shared. Apple is also offering three free months of Creator Studio to customers who purchase a qualifying new Mac or iPad around launch.</p>
<p>But Creator Studio isn’t the only way you can access most of these apps. Apple says all of the major apps included in Creator Studio will continue to be available as one-time purchases on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro remains priced at $299.99, Logic Pro at $199.99, Pixelmator Pro at $49.99, Motion at $49.99, Compressor at $49.99 and MainStage at $29.99. Users who already own these apps can keep using them and re-download them from the App Store as usual.</p>
<p>On the iPad, however, things are different. Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro for iPad are only available through the Creator Studio subscription. There is no standalone purchase option for those apps on iPadOS.</p>
<p>Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform remain free for everyone to download and use. Apple says those apps will continue receiving updates, including the upcoming visual design changes tied to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.</p>
<p>Without a Creator Studio subscription, you can still create, edit and collaborate in those apps. What you will not get are the paid templates, Content Hub assets and certain intelligence features.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-what-happens-to-your-projects-if-you-cancel">What happens to your projects if you cancel</h2>
<p>Apple says projects and content you create with an active subscription remain licensed as part of your original work.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro projects remain on your devices and can be copied or shared elsewhere. But you will need an active subscription to open or edit projects in those paid apps.</p>
<p>Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform documents remain editable without a subscription. However, you will not be able to make new edits that rely on paid features once your subscription ends.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-other-information-about-the-apple-creator-studio-app-bundle">Other information about the Apple Creator Studio app bundle</h2>
<p>Apple Creator Studio also comes with some immediate trade-offs. Alongside the bundle, Apple confirmed that the older Pixelmator app for iPhone and iPad, now described as Pixelmator Classic, will no longer receive updates. Apple says it will remain functional, but development is shifting to Pixelmator Pro, including the new iPad version included with Creator Studio.</p>
<p>But don&#39;t expect the standalone versions of the apps to maintain feature parity with their Creator Studio counterparts. Per <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7ad37d82-e859-4466-9dbd-e68c114e5e43&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Apple%27s+FAQ&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vcGl4ZWxtYXRvci1wcm8vIzp-OnRleHQ9V2hhdCUyMGlzJTIwdGhlLHRoZSUyMEFwcCVDMiVBMFN0b3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3YWQzN2Q4Mi1lODU5LTQ0NjYtOWRiZC1lNjhjMTE0ZTVlNDMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9waXhlbG1hdG9yLXByby8jOn46dGV4dD1XaGF0JTIwaXMlMjB0aGUsdGhlJTIwQXBwJUMyJUEwU3RvcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeaqbqxVQG6LJISNfywRbgzoQrTzhWj339COoM3gHhG_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fpixelmator-pro%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DWhat%2520is%2520the%2Cthe%2520App%25C2%25A0Store" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/pixelmator-pro/#:~:text=What%20is%20the,the%20App%C2%A0Store">Apple&#39;s FAQ</a>, &quot;The Apple Creator Studio version of Pixelmator Pro includes access to the Warp Tool feature,&quot; which implies that feature isn&#39;t present on the standalone version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More broadly, the bundle puts Apple more directly in competition with Adobe and other subscription-focused creative platforms, especially for people who are looking for a lower monthly entry point. At the same time, Apple is keeping one-time purchases on the table for Mac users, even as iPad access moves behind a subscription.</p>
<p>Apple Creator Studio will be available January 28. Whether it makes sense will likely come down to which device you work on and whether you would otherwise pay upfront for one or more of Apple’s pro apps.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The peak time for deals on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html">streaming services</a> — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That&#39;s $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> 
<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> 
<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> 
<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p>

It was already considering spinning off the business back then.</p><p>“Specs are launching at an important time, as artificial intelligence transforms the way that we use our computers,” the company said in its announcement. The glasses’ operating system can help you get things done faster based on what they see and what they know about your behaviors. Snap also says that its smartglasses can keep you present in the moment with friends and family unlike phones and computers, since they superimpose digital tools over your view of the real world.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn has long been a platform for showing off professional accomplishments. Now, the company is leaning into the rise of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115135/what-is-vibe-coding-exactly/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">vibe coding</a> by allowing users to show off their proficiency with various AI coding tools directly on their profiles.</p><p>The company is partnering with Replit, Lovable, Descript and Relay.app&nbsp; on the feature and is working on integrations with fellow Microsoft-owned GitHub as well as Zapier.&nbsp; LinkedIn has always allowed users to add various skills and certifications to their profiles. But what makes the latest update a bit different is that users aren&#39;t self-reporting their own qualifications. Instead, LinkedIn is allowing the companies behind the AI tools to assess an individual&#39;s relative skill and assign a level of proficiency that goes directly to their profile.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, AI app maker Lovable could award someone a &quot;bronze&quot; in &quot;vibe coding,&quot; while the platform Replit uses numerical levels and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://Relay.app" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><a target="_blank" class="link">Relay.app</a></a> may determine that someone is an &quot;intermediate&quot; level &quot;AI Agent Builder,&quot; according to screenshots shared by LinkedIn. These levels should dynamically update as people get more experience using the relevant tools, according to LinkedIn. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-27_at_16.04.45.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-27_at_16.04.45.png" style="height:150px;width:744px;" alt="Lovable&#39;s vibe coding rating system." data-uuid="89c0a2ca-15c4-4272-936b-cc5a889480ef"/><figcaption>Lovable&#39;s vibe coding rating system.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LinkedIn</div></figure><p>Of course, the update also comes at a time when companies have used these same kinds of AI tools to lay off thousands of workers. So while there&#39;s may be value in showing off your vibe coding skills, there are still many workers who likely aren&#39;t as excited about&nbsp; ceding more ground to AI. When I asked, LinkedIn&#39;s head of career products Pat Whealan about this he said that&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;AI-specific skills are an increasingly important signal to recruiters and the latest update will make it easier for them to assess candidates&#39; skills. But he added that the intention isn&#39;t to make AI-specific skills the sole focus. &quot;This is less about replacing any of those other existing signals, and more about showing new ways that people are doing work,&quot; he tells Engadget. &quot;And how do we give a verifiable signal to both hirers and other people looking at their profile, that they actually are using these tools on a regular basis.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/linkedin-will-let-you-show-off-your-vibe-coding-expertise-140000776.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The P9 boasts transfer speeds of up to 800MB/s, making moving games to the card that much faster. As for load times, in our testing we found that any microSD Express, the standard the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/">Switch 2</a> requires, will offer roughly the same performance. This format is pretty new, so there aren&#39;t a ton of cards on the market. As such, the P9 makes our list of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html">best microSD cards</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

Thanks to a (now permissions-restricted) <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/479094248?pli=1"><ins>bug report</ins></a> discovered on Google&#39;s Issue Tracker, we have what is almost certainly a first look at the Android-on-desktop project, codenamed <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/aluminium-os-android-for-pcs-3619092/"><ins>Aluminium OS</ins></a>.</p>
<p>First spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/27/android-desktop-leak/"><em><ins>9to5Google</ins></em></a>, the bug report was about Chrome incognito tabs and included two screen recordings. The description said the recordings were from an HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook. The video shows a &#39;chrome://version/&#39; page where one can see the OS listed as Android 16. <em>9to5Google </em>also said the bug report listed &quot;ALOS&quot; as the operating system, understood to stand for Aluminium OS, along with a corresponding build number that matches the one seen in the screen recordings.</p>

The videos also show the Play Store, windowed apps, split-screen multitasking and a version of Chrome with an extensions button, which is currently only available on the desktop version. Google has yet to comment on the leak, so users may have to wait for future Android 16 updates for a more in-depth look at the upcoming desktop experience.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/our-first-look-at-googles-android-for-pc-interface-leaks-in-a-bug-report-133006008.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is recommending measures to give publishers more control over how their content is used in Google’s AI overviews. The aim is to “provide a fairer deal for content publishers, particularly news organizations,” the CMA’s chief executive Sarah Cardell said in a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-proposes-package-of-measures-to-improve-google-search-services-in-uk" data-i13n="slk:press release;cpos:1;pos:1">press release</a>. </p><p>With Google accounting for more than 90 percent of search inquiries in the UK, the CMA recently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-uks-antitrust-regulator-will-keep-a-closer-eye-on-google-search-130021994.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">designated</a> the company with “strategic market status” for search under the Digital Market Act. That allows the regulator to apply “conduct requirements” on Google to promote competition and avoid antitrust issues.</p><p>With those new powers, the CMA proposed a number of measures today. The first is a set of controls that would allow publishers to opt out of their content being used for features like AI Overviews or to train AI models. Google would also need to properly attribute publisher content. </p><p>Another measure would require Google to apply fair search result rankings for businesses, with an “effective process for raising and investigating issues.” Google would also need to provide a “choice screen” for alternative search options on Android mobile and Chrome browsers. </p><p>“These targeted and proportionate actions would give UK businesses and consumers more choice and control over how they interact with Google’s search services — as well as unlocking greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy,” Cardell said in a statement.</p><p>In response, Google <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-ai-features-controls/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">wrote</a> that it’s “exploring updates to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features.” The aim, it said, is to keep search helpful for people who want information quickly while allowing publishers to better manage content. “Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,” the company wrote, adding that it’s “optimistic” it can meet the CMA’s requirements.</p><p>When its new designation was announced in October 2025, Google complained that some of the proposed interventions would inhibit UK innovation and growth. Citing a study, the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-ai-features-controls/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">said</a> that similar measures imposed by the European Union produced “negative results” that “have cost businesses $114 billion.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/uk-wants-to-give-web-publishers-a-fairer-deal-with-googles-ai-overviews-132742850.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="jump-link-design">Design</h2>
<p>Shokz has a number of over-the-ear hook earbud designs under its belt, and they all carry the OpenFit name. That is also an apt description of these products since they all sit outside of your ear canal, which inherently allows you to remain aware of your surroundings. The company currently offers the OpenFit 2 and 2+ in addition to the OpenFit Air, at prices ranging from $120 to $200. The OpenFit Pro looks similar to its predecessors, albeit with a slightly smaller main housing and more pops of silver. Those ear hooks have a titanium wire inside and are wrapped in “ultra-soft” silicone. They’re plenty flexible and provide a secure yet comfortable fit for daily wear and workouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both earbuds of the OpenFit Pro have tiny physical controls for media playback, volume adjustments, calls and noise settings. The various actions are customizable through the Shokz app. During several weeks of testing, these buttons responded quickly to my clicks and using them didn’t cause the OpenFit Pro to shift out of place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenFit Pro comes with a charging case that&#39;s larger than most other earbuds, which is understandable since Shokz had to accommodate that ear hook. However, the case is quite flat, so it doesn’t take up too much room and easily fits in a small pocket. There’s a USB-C port around back for charging and a Bluetooth pairing button inside. The case also supports wireless charging, if your charging pad is large enough.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-noise-reduction-vs-noise-cancellation">Noise reduction vs. noise cancellation</h2>
<p>The OpenFit Pro is the first set of Shokz earbuds with what the company calls Open-Ear Noise Reduction. This is essentially the company’s take on active noise cancellation (ANC), but it’s&nbsp;designed to be effective with earbuds that don’t enter your ear canals. Since your ears aren&#39;t completely sealed off from the noise of the outside world, Shokz is limited in just how much sound it can reduce. But I’m happy to report the company’s microphone and algorithm combo is actually quite effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shokz says its noise reduction works best in moderately loud environments, like offices and cafes. I’ve found the OpenFit Pro does well to reduce the distraction of constant noise sources like HVAC systems, fans and white noise machines. The earbuds completely silenced a particularly raucous HVAC fan in my hotel room during CES. It&#39;s not <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">the most effective</a> at cutting down environmental noise, but in exchange you get a more comfortable set of earbuds while also remaining somewhat alert and aware of your surroundings</p>

<p>The OpenFit Pro is Shokz’ most premium set of earbuds, so the features don’t end at noise reduction. Head tracking, customizable EQ, multipoint pairing, find my earbuds and wear detection are also available here. The company’s app displays battery percentages for each earbud and the case right at the top of the main screen with access to the rest of its tools just below. You don’t have to go searching and tapping through menus until you’ve found what you’re looking for. As someone who has to contend with <em>a lot </em>of headphone apps, I appreciate when all of the options are quickly available from the home screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like other companies offer on their open-type earbuds, Shokz has given the EQ settings a few presets specifically designed for the open nature of the product. Those include a Vocal option that boosts mids for audiobooks or calls and a Private mode that reduces high frequency sounds to prevent leakage. I usually kept the OpenFit Pro around 70 percent volume, which is loud enough that a nearby neighbor in a quiet room could hear the muffled rage of Incendiary’s “Echo of Nothing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another audio feature that’s worth mentioning is Dolby Atmos support. More specifically, the OpenFit Pro is “optimized for Dolby Atmos,” thanks in part to the aforementioned Dolby Head Tracking. You can disable the enhanced audio and head tracking individually in the Shokz app, but I found leaving Atmos on all the time, even when I wasn’t listening to Dolby Atmos music, gave the earbuds a more immersive, more detailed sound profile.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-sound-quality-and-calls">Sound quality and calls</h2>
<p>Overall sound quality is another area where the OpenFit Pro shines. Many open-design earbuds struggle to manage much bass or detailed highs, both of which Shokz has addressed with its driver design. Dual 11x20mm diaphragms power a larger, rectangular driver that’s the equivalent of a 16.7mm round driver in a “normal” set of earbuds. For comparison, most in-ear models typically use 10-12mm drivers, with smaller designs housing 6-8mm units. Shokz says it tuned the OpenFit Pro with what it calls OpenBass 2.0 and DirectPitch 3.0, features that provide better bass performance and audio that’s beamed more directly into your ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that combines for some truly impressive audio performance in a set of open earbuds. The OpenFit Pro still doesn’t muster the bombastic bass that earbuds like the WF-1000XM5 offer, but the low-end performance here is greatly improved over other open models like the LinkBuds Clip. While Thrice’s “Silhouette” still has enough driving kick drum, bass guitar and riffs to do the track justice, there isn’t as deep of a growl as the song has on flagship options from Bose, Sony and Sennheiser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also more clarity and detail in the tuning here than on other open models, which is on full display when listening to albums like Wet Leg’s alternative masterpiece <em>moisturizer. </em>I love how I can hear the texture of the guitars and drums, and even the vocals, which are the kind of subtle details open earbuds typically lack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should also mention that overall sound quality will depend on how the OpenFit Pro sits on your ears. I can easily improve the bass tone if I slightly push the earbuds in closer to my ear canals, but all of the observations I just made were with the earbuds in their natural resting position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shokz says the three-microphone setup that assists with its noise reduction tech also helps with calls. That configuration, combined with AI-powered voice recognition, should be able to block over 99 percent of background noise and deliver sharper vocal clarity overall. While that first part holds true — the OpenFit Pro does a great job canceling any ambient roar — the overall voice quality here is below average. It will certainly work for casual chats, but I wouldn’t recommend it for regular work calls or any scenario where you might need to record what you’re saying. My voice sounded muffled during calls and voice memos, more like I would over speakerphone than a set of carefully tuned earbuds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-openfit-pro-battery-life">OpenFit Pro battery life</h2>
<p>Shokz promises up to 12 hours of battery life on the OpenFit Pro with up to 50 hours of total use when you factor in the charging case. That’s with noise reduction disabled though; you can expect up to six hours with that turned on (24 hours total with the case). During weeks of testing, I never encountered any issues hitting those figures and the OpenFit Pro never struggled to get through a full work day of music, podcasts and calls using a combination of the default Open Mode and Noise Reduction mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the charging case can be topped up wirelessly if you have a compatible accessory that’s large enough. And if you find yourself with a pair of completely dead earbuds, Shokz includes a quick-charge feature that gives you up to four hours of use in 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something that closely resembles the design of the OpenFit Pro, Shokz’ other OpenFit models are likely your best alternatives. The $200 OpenFit 2+ offers 11 hours of battery life and Dolby Audio with both physical buttons and touch controls. The most affordable option, the OpenFit Air ($120), lasts up to six hours on a charge but doesn’t have enhanced audio or wireless charging. As you step down from the OpenFit Pro, you’re missing out on noise reduction, Dolby Atmos and longer battery life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JBL will soon have three models of its own to rival the Shokz OpenFit line.

These all have a variety of seemingly handy features, but none of them offer any kind of noise reduction and they all have shorter battery life than the OpenFit Pro and OpenFit 2+. I also cannot vouch for them as I haven’t tested any of JBL’s open designs yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shokz has achieved a rare feat. The company managed to build a set of open-fit earbuds that retain all of those inherent benefits while also providing some relief from distractions with noise reduction. No, the over-the-ear hook design isn’t for everyone — especially if you wear glasses — but the comfy, secure fit and IP55 rating make these a great choice for workouts.

Sound quality is better than you’ll find on most open earbuds as well, but you’ll probably enjoy not having anything crammed into your ears most. And you don’t have to make too many sacrifices here for that satisfaction. </p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">confirmed</a> that it’s letting go of 16,000 workers and employees across its organization. In an announcement by company SVP Beth Galetti, she explained that Amazon was going through organizational changes to reduce layers and remove bureaucracy. Affected employees in the US will be given 90 days to look for another internal role and will receive severance pay if they do not find any. Galetti also said that Amazon doesn’t have plans to announce “broad reductions every few months” but admitted that the company could “make adjustments as appropriate.”</p><p>News about the layoffs was leaked in an email mistakenly sent out early to workers, along with a calendar invitation for a meeting dubbed internally as “Project Dawn.” In the email seen by <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/premature-amazon-layoff-email-touches-off-social-media-panic" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>BBC</em></a>, Amazon Web Services Senior Vice President Colleen Aubrey told workers that their “impacted colleagues” from the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been notified. “Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” Aubrey reportedly wrote in the email. </p><p>Amazon <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">eliminated 14,000 roles</a> back in October 2025 across its games, logistics, payment and cloud computing divisions, with the availability of AI technologies  being one of the main reasons for the layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it&#39;s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Amazon said in its announcement back then. This new round of layoffs is just a continuation of the previous one, as Amazon was reportedly looking to let 30,000 people go from the start. </p><p>The announcement comes shortly after Amazon revealed that it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/amazon-go-and-fresh-stores-are-closing-as-amazon-focuses-on-grocery-delivery-and-whole-foods-180448412.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">shutting down</a> its remaining Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores and will focus on grocery deliveries instead. To note, Amazon’s year-over-year net sales grew by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2025 alone. Its net income increased to $21.2 billion compared to the $15.3 billion it posted in the third quarter of 2024. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-latest-round-of-layoffs-will-affect-16000-workers-120000702.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Windscribe is a virtual private network (VPN) with intense &quot;How do you do, fellow kids?&quot; energy. It has servers in 69 countries and an annual plan that costs $69, an obsession with the sex number that rivals Elon Musk&#39;s. I&#39;m shocked that it doesn&#39;t have a subscription costing $4.20 per month.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s another side to Windscribe&#39;s cringe: an obsession with independence and a Bernie Sanders-like anger on behalf of an exploited public. In a market where the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">best VPNs</a> aim for professionalism, Windscribe aspires to be punk. Its iconoclasm may have led it to develop an app that looks like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">ExpressVPN</a> in a trash compactor, but it also spurred Windscribe to offer a strong free plan and forgo financial relationships with VPN reviewers. That attitude earned it a spot on my list of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">best free VPNs</a>.</p>
<p>Although Windscribe&#39;s heart is in the right place, my job is to figure out whether that translates into a good product. I used our rigorous <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">VPN testing procedure</a> to rate Windscribe in 11 categories. You can find my results in the table below and a final verdict at the end of the review.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-installing-configuring-and-using-windscribe">Installing, configuring and using Windscribe</h2>
<p>The first step is always to figure out how easy or hard the VPN is to use. Windscribe and other VPNs are important tools, but you&#39;ll never use them if the UI gets in the way. I tested Windscribe&#39;s desktop apps on Windows and Mac, its mobile apps on iOS and Android and its Chrome and Firefox browser extensions.</p>
<p>To start with, let me say that installing Windscribe is a breeze no matter where you do it. The downloaders and installers handle their own business, only requiring you to grant a few permissions. The apps arrive on your system ready to use out of the box.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-windows">Windows</h3>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll notice about Windscribe is that it&#39;s not even slightly interested in looking like any other VPN. It crams everything into an extremely compact window, which has some advantages — mainly that it&#39;s easy to operate it while looking at another app. On the downside, well, it looks like this.</p>

<p>The Windscribe team will probably just say that I&#39;m brainwashed by the establishment, but there&#39;s a good reason that most VPNs choose designs with a little more space. This fiddly console, most of which is taken up by information you can&#39;t interact with, is likely to confirm all a newcomer&#39;s worst fears about using a VPN. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Private Internet Access</a> had a similar problem of tightening its app design to the point of being incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The problems persist when you get to the settings page. It&#39;s easy to make sense of a VPN without technical knowledge, but Windscribe&#39;s preferences menu does everything it can to obscure that truth. Highly technical features are mixed in with options for casual users, and the explanatory blurbs usually cloud the issue even further.</p>
<p>Even the &quot;Look &amp; Feel&quot; settings somehow manage to be confusing. What is the difference between the Stretch, Fill and Tile modes for aspect ratio? What the heck is a Bundled background, and what does it matter whether it&#39;s Square, Palm, Ripple, Drip or Snow? The answers to all these can be found by playing around or looking in the knowledgebase, but a VPN really shouldn&#39;t require that for its most basic toggles.</p>
<p>Once you get used to Windscribe and learn where to find the features that actually matter, it runs quite smoothly. Connections are never delayed and there are none of the random error messages that have dogged me on other VPNs. In a world of VPNs that look great but run clunkily, Windscribe has built one that looks terrible but runs great. I can&#39;t complain about how well it works, but is it too much to ask for a provider that does both? (Oh, wait, that&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Proton VPN</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-mac">Mac</h3>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s macOS app is almost identical to its Windows app. That deserves praise in itself — you&#39;ll get much the same experience no matter which type of computer you use. But it also means the Mac app shares the same problems.</p>
<figure>

<p>There&#39;s the same overly compact design cluttered with too much information. The same technobabble-filled options menu. And the same fundamental solidity underlying it all: a VPN that does the job beautifully but has no interest in being accessible. It would be a mistake to write Windscribe off because of its app design, but it&#39;s important to know what you&#39;ll have to work through.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-android">Android</h3>
<p>One thing I can&#39;t fault Windscribe for is a lack of consistency. The Android app looks a lot like the Windows and Mac apps, only lightly adapted for the mobile format. On these devices, the design decisions make more sense — the UI writing is still impenetrable for casual users, but the compact pages look a lot more normal on a phone screen.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-ios">iOS</h3>
<p>There&#39;s not a lot to say about Windscribe on iOS that I haven&#39;t already said about the other three main platforms. Looking over all my screenshots, it seems fairly clear that Windscribe&#39;s problems — much like PIA&#39;s — come from starting on mobile and trying to make that same design work on desktop. It&#39;s still not great to look at, but I can at least see where they&#39;re coming from.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-browser-extensions">Browser extensions</h3>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s extensions for Chrome and Firefox look a little like its desktop and mobile VPN apps, but they act a little differently. They serve the same basic purpose as the standalone apps — changing your IP address and location — but they&#39;re also customizable ad blockers for the web page you&#39;re currently on.</p>

<p>For example, in the image above, I can control what location Google perceives me to be in. But I can also control what gets blocked by choosing to let Google bypass certain features. Clicking the leftmost button makes the current website skip the VPN tunnel. The central button shuts off the ad blocker and the right-hand button shuts off the features on the Privacy section of the preferences menu. Like everything else about Windscribe, it&#39;s unintuitive but works great once you figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-speed-test">Windscribe speed test</h2>
<p>I used <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://speedtest.net" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">speedtest.net</a> to test Windscribe&#39;s speeds. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with the jargon, <strong>Ping </strong>measures a server&#39;s latency, which is how long it takes a single packet of data to reach it from your device. <strong>Download speed </strong>measures how much data can be downloaded at a time, while <strong>upload speed </strong>shows how quickly you can send data to the network. Think of ping as your car&#39;s speed in miles per hour and download and upload speed as the amount of traffic on the road.</p>
<p>As usual, I used the WireGuard protocol to run these tests, since it&#39;s almost always the fastest. Starting with my unprotected speeds at home in Portland, I moved gradually farther away until I was connecting to the other side of the world. Ideally, ping should increase linearly (not exponentially), while download and upload speeds don&#39;t dip much at all. I&#39;ve recorded Windscribe&#39;s performance in the table below.</p>

<p>Windscribe gave me some of the shortest latencies I&#39;ve ever seen — comparable to CyberGhost, whose ping lengths I was also very impressed by. Its download and upload speeds also look a lot like CyberGhost&#39;s, with both firmly in good-but-not-amazing territory.</p>
<p>However, Windscribe&#39;s speeds were a lot more consistent. Throughout the tests, I hardly ever saw major fluctuations in the same location, on any metric. The Nairobi server seemed to be under some strain, but that&#39;s not unusual for a VPN in Africa. Every location except for that one followed a smooth downward curve. I&#39;m happy with that; speed is one of the areas where you want your VPN to be reliably boring, not flashy.</p>
<p>Practically, a speed test like this suggests that Windscribe is best for gaming, livestreaming and video chatting, and that it&#39;s perfectly serviceable for any other task you could do online. You may not get the best speeds you&#39;ve ever seen, but unless your internet is bad to begin with, Windscribe should not slow it down enough to be noticeable.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-security-test">Windscribe security test</h2>
<p>I can say up top that Windscribe doesn&#39;t seem to have any dangerous security flaws, but I&#39;ll take this section to explain why I think that. To start with, it uses only the three <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">VPN protocols</a> currently known to be secure: WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2, plus a few other options all based on OpenVPN. With those options, you can be sure you&#39;re getting encryption that&#39;s currently uncrackable.</p>
<p>It also passed two batteries of tests I ran on its security. The first set of tests looks for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks and other slip-ups that might <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">reveal your real IP address</a>. The second checks whether data packets sent through the VPN tunnel are actually getting encrypted. Check each section below for details on how Windscribe did.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-vpn-protocols">VPN protocols</h3>
<p>A VPN protocol determines how exactly a VPN makes contact between its own servers, your device and your ISP. Certain protocols can make your VPN run faster, stabilize a shaky connection or get into websites other protocols fail to unlock. If you&#39;re having a problem with your VPN, changing the protocol is one of the first troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>Windscribe makes a total of six protocols available, though it&#39;s really just three, since four of the six are variations on OpenVPN. <strong>WireGuard</strong> works on every platform, and is currently the fastest and most stable — its drawback used to be that it was new, but with the passage of time, it&#39;s no longer new enough to make it suspect.</p>
<p><strong>IKEv2</strong> is a connection protocol that uses the separate IPSec protocol for its security. This double team&#39;s main strength is reconnecting to the VPN when a device switches networks; it&#39;s also good at not draining phone batteries. Windscribe supports IKEv2 on Mac, iOS and Windows.</p>
<p><strong>OpenVPN </strong>is the oldest open-source VPN protocol, refined by over a decade of repeated probing by volunteers. It&#39;s not only relatively fast and highly secure, but comes in two flavors: <strong>TCP</strong>, which makes connections more stable, and <strong>UDP</strong>, which is usually faster and should be your first resort with OpenVPN. Windscribe supports OpenVPN on all platforms.</p>
<p>Windscribe rounds out the selection with two unique protocols, both focused on hiding your VPN traffic from firewalls and censors. <strong>Stealth </strong>uses the same connection ports as HTTPS, so it can&#39;t be blocked by shutting certain ports down entirely. <strong>WStunnel </strong>obfuscates connections even further by using the extremely common WebSocket technology to establish VPN connections. Both these proprietary protocols are much slower than the other options, but can save you if you find yourself repeatedly blocked while using Windscribe.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-leak-test">Leak test</h3>
<p>I started my leak tests by using <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://ipleak.net" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">ipleak.net</a> to check several Windscribe servers for IP leaks of all sorts. Each time I connected and checked my location, I only saw the VPN server&#39;s IP address, never my real one. I tried to trip Windscribe up by switching servers while remaining connected, even changing continents, but my true location never once slipped out. This puts its security solidly above CyberGhost, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">Norton VPN</a> and many others.</p>

<p>Windscribe automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while connected, so IPv6 leaks weren&#39;t going to be a thing. I finished the test by checking five servers using browserleaks.com/webrtc, finding no issues each time.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-encryption-test">Encryption test</h3>
<p>The final step is to make sure Windscribe is applying encryption properly through its VPN protocols. For this test, I used a free packet sniffer app called Wireshark to look directly at what my computer was sending out.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_Wireshark_test.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Windscribe_Wireshark_test.png" style="height:1188px;width:2262px;" alt="Windscribe&#39;s encryption looks solid." data-uuid="7e5f0fb0-017b-4187-8daf-d0ca0e9a0057">

</figure>
<p>It&#39;s a bit hard to tell what&#39;s going on, but to summarize, I&#39;ve loaded a website without HTTPS protection and checked whether Windscribe managed to apply that protection. The lack of readable information in the data stream proves that its encryption is indeed working as expected.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-much-does-windscribe-cost">How much does Windscribe cost?</h2>
<p>Windscribe has three subscription options (not counting its free plan, which I&#39;ll discuss in a moment). One month of Pro service costs $9.00 — after Mullvad, the second-cheapest monthly subscription to a top-tier VPN. You can also pay $69 for a 12-month Pro subscription, working out to $5.75 per month. Both of these tiers give you the exact same set of Pro features and can be used on unlimited simultaneous devices.</p>

</figure>
<p>The third option is to build your own plan. Build-A-Plan is an interesting beast that&#39;s unique to Windscribe. When you choose a custom plan, you must spend at least $3 per month. Gaining access to all the Pro servers in a country costs $1. For each country you add, you get an additional 10GB of data per month on top of the 10GB already included for free.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d rather not budget your data at all, you can pay another $1 for unlimited data, plus 10 custom rules for the R.O.B.E.R.T. content blocker (I&#39;ll untangle the tortured acronym soon). It&#39;s a little convoluted, but wonderfully flexible. You can even change your Build-A-Plan in the middle of the subscription period.</p>
<p>Windscribe also offers shared static IPs for an extra fee. You can add a datacenter IP to any plan for $2 per month or a residential IP (usually better at getting around restrictions) for $8 per month. Team billing is also available through ScribeForce at $3 per seat per month, including a centralized management panel.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-the-windscribe-free-plan">The Windscribe free plan</h3>
<p>Windscribe isn&#39;t the overall best free VPN — <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9e251e36-74b6-419a-8a7b-de182315da42&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=70d514cc-fd71-4f54-895d-164e9e7fa1e2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hide.me&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaGlkZS5tZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzBkNTE0Y2MtZmQ3MS00ZjU0LTg5NWQtMTY0ZTllN2ZhMWUyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaGlkZS5tZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYuP1UXKa9Pc-qMnHvjjlG6VCzmxghd2rThWvY8vFzFQ&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fhide.me" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hide.me;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1" data-original-link="http://hide.me"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">hide.me</a> wins that honor with its more flexible data limit — but it&#39;s close. Free users get access to servers in 10 countries: the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Germany, Switzerland, Romania and Hong Kong. If you plot that on a map, you&#39;ll see that the Windscribe free plan is most useful in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Free users start with a data allotment of 2GB per month. The monthly limit rises to 10GB if you sign up with a confirmed email address and 15GB if you post about Windscribe on Twitter/X. That&#39;s enough for casual browsing, but streaming in standard definition takes about 1GB per hour, so you won&#39;t be doing much binge-watching.</p>
<p>On the upside, a free plan gives you access to all Windscribe&#39;s features except for dynamic port forwarding. You can set three R.O.B.E.R.T. rules and use your free account on an infinite number of devices (subject to the usual restrictions about exploiting that for commercial purposes — as Windscribe itself states, no one person has 30 devices that need a VPN).</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-side-apps-and-bundles">Windscribe side apps and bundles</h2>
<p>Windscribe doesn&#39;t have any add-ons of its own except for static IP addresses. However, it does offer discount codes for a group of &quot;partners in privacy&quot; that share its business ethics. The coupon codes are available <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/windscribes-gang" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">here</a> and don&#39;t require a Windscribe subscription to use.</p>

<p>There are currently five allies in the gang. <strong>Control D</strong> offers DNS filtering for organizations to block unwanted websites; the Windscribe coupon gives you 50 percent off. You can get 25 percent off a one-year subscription to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://addy.io" data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link"><strong>addy.io</strong></a>, an open-source email anonymizer, and <strong>Ente</strong>, an encrypted storage space for photos and videos.</p>
<p>Rounding out the team are <strong>Kagi</strong>,<strong> </strong>a private search engine which you can use for three months free with the Windscribe coupon, and <strong>Notesnook</strong>, an encrypted notes app. Windscribe&#39;s coupon gives you a 10% discount on Notesnook&#39;s yearly plans in perpetuity.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-close-reading-windscribes-privacy-policy">Close-reading Windscribe&#39;s privacy policy</h2>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s marketing positions it as serious about user independence, so I came into this section hoping for a privacy policy that backs those words up. An early green flag is that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/privacy/" data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1">the policy</a> is short, succinct and obviously written to be read by the users themselves. It&#39;s also fantastic that you can sign up without an email address (though you will need one to get the full data allotment on the free plan).</p>
<p>Windscribe gathers information on its website using Piwik, an open-source analytics tool that it manages itself; no third parties are involved. The Windscribe app itself collects no information except for the amount of data used in a month, the time of your last connection and the number of devices you have online at once. When actively connected, it also gives you an anonymized username necessary for the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols.</p>
<p>My only quibble is that Windscribe is oddly reluctant to identify which third-party payment processors it uses. The information does exist elsewhere — <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/knowledge-base/articles/how-do-i-change-my-payment-methodupdate-credit-card-info/" data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1">an article</a> in the knowledgebase states that payments are handled by &quot;trusted third party processors such as PayPal and Stripe,&quot; and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/knowledge-base/articles/who-is-coinpayments-and-why-am-i-sending-my-crypto-to-them-and-not-you/" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">another page</a> says that CoinPayments handles cryptocurrency transactions. It&#39;s a small thing, but the rest of the policy is so airtight that it stands out.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-independent-privacy-audits">Independent privacy audits</h3>
<p>Windscribe&#39;s apps are fully open-source (you can find them on Github <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://github.com/Windscribe" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">here</a>). In addition to this general exposure, it&#39;s also undergone three intensive audits from security firms. Leviathan Security looked into its desktop apps in 2021 and its mobile apps in 2022. The auditors made a total of five high-severity recommendations, all of which Windscribe claims to have addressed.</p>
<p>More recently, Windscribe had its entire codebase audited by PacketLabs. The auditors&#39; June 2024 report found that some of Windscribe&#39;s code was storing more user information than it strictly needed to. Windscribe also claims to have handled this risk. More importantly, PacketLabs found no intentional subversions of Windscribe&#39;s no-logs policy, so its privacy statements can likely be trusted.</p>
<p>Further corroboration of the latter came from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/blog/windscribe-greek-court-case/" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">a 2025 court case</a> in which Windscribe founder and CEO Yegor Sak was indicted in Greece and charged with a crime committed by a Windscribe user through an IP address in Finland. This case is obviously absurd — like charging the head of GM with a single instance of vehicular manslaughter committed by someone driving a Buick — but Sak was obliged to appear in court anyway.</p>
<p>As Sak writes in the linked post, he could have turned over the logs and shown who actually committed the crime, but he couldn&#39;t since Windscribe doesn&#39;t keep that information. Had there been an alternative to waging an expensive and inconvenient legal campaign in another country, Sak would surely have taken it. The fact that he didn&#39;t is strong proof of Windscribe&#39;s no-logging policy.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-can-windscribe-change-your-virtual-location">Can Windscribe change your virtual location?</h2>
<p>Changing your IP address with a VPN can do more than just anonymize your internet activity. A service like Windscribe can give you an IP address associated with a certain country or region, letting you use the internet like you were there. This has applications ranging from the serious (break out of a nationwide firewall to document human rights issues) to the fun (get new titles on streaming platforms without paying for a new subscription).</p>
<p>Netflix is a great tool for testing whether a VPN can change your virtual location. Like most streamers, it tries to block all VPN access to protect the copyrights it holds. Consequently, if a VPN can crack Netflix, it must be serious about keeping its server network fresh to foil any potential blockers.</p>

<p>Windscribe got a perfect score. Netflix loaded easily every time, and the content was always localized to the country I chose. With this performance combined with its fairly consistent speeds over long distances, Windscribe makes a nearly perfect streaming VPN. The only downside is that the data limits on the free plan mean you&#39;ll probably have to pay for serious streaming time.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-investigating-windscribes-server-network">Investigating Windscribe&#39;s server network</h2>
<p>Windscribe has 193 server locations in 71 countries, which it insists on listing as &quot;69+&quot; (again, hilarious). Although 193 sounds like a lot, many of them are duplicate locations in the same city. This isn&#39;t necessarily a problem, but for accuracy&#39;s sake, the total number of cities with Windscribe servers is 122.</p>

<p>The bigger story here is Windscribe&#39;s spurning of virtual servers. A virtual server location is physically located in a different region than the one it outwardly displays. For example, a server with an Indian IP address might really be in Singapore. Throughout the entire Windscribe network, only two servers are virtual: one in India and one in Antarctica.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad. On the positive side, the near-total lack of virtual servers means you can be sure of how any server will perform. If it says it&#39;s in Buenos Aires, it&#39;ll run like it&#39;s in Buenos Aires — you won&#39;t be surprised with lagging speeds because it&#39;s really in Miami. This also makes it clear that Windscribe isn&#39;t interested in pumping up its network size for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, virtual locations aren&#39;t an inherently bad thing. Windscribe acts as though advertising hype is the only reason any VPN would employ them, but there are real use cases. Virtual servers can be used to place locations inside countries where real servers would risk confiscation by the government, like Russia, India and China. Windscribe chooses instead to place real servers in Russia and India, both of which have data retention laws that directly conflict with its own privacy policy.</p>
<p>Does this mean that using Windscribe&#39;s Russian servers will earn you a midnight visit from the FSB? Probably not. Assuming Windscribe is following its no-logs policy (which appears to be the case), there won&#39;t be any user data on those servers if the government seizes them. But it does mean they&#39;re effectively running illegal data centers which could be raided and shut down at any time. Be aware of this if you depend on Windscribe&#39;s locations in Russia or India.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-extra-features-of-windscribe">Extra features of Windscribe</h2>
<p>As covered in the UI section, Windscribe has a lot going on in its apps. The Connection tab alone has 13 different features, including two submenus with several options of their own. With this many options, and so many of them highly situational, I won&#39;t be able to cover every nook and cranny without this review getting seriously bloated. I&#39;ve instead chosen some of the most important and illustrative features to give you a clear sense of the whole picture.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-network-options">Network Options</h3>
<p>You&#39;ll find this feature at the top of the Connection tab. When you click Network Options, you should see the name of your current Wi-Fi network and all the others your Windscribe account has discovered. This feature lets you control how the VPN reacts to each network it encounters, not unlike <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html" data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1">CyberGhost&#39;s Smart Rules</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The app does a remarkably poor job of explaining how this works, so I&#39;ll break it down for you here. When the Auto-Secure Networks switch is turned on, Windscribe will automatically mark each new network as Secured — a word which here means &quot;Windscribe turns on when it encounters the network.&quot;</p>
<p>So far, so good. But if you turn Auto-Secure Networks off, things get weird. Without it, Windscribe tags every network you encounter as Unsecured. Whenever you connect to an Unsecured network, Windscribe immediately disconnects itself. This means it secures all Secured networks and does not secure any Unsecured networks.</p>
<p>It feels backwards until you realize that Windscribe is referring entirely to itself here. &quot;Secured&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that the Wi-Fi network is password-protected or otherwise considered safe, and &quot;Unsecured&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s open to the public without a password. All that matters is whether or not you want Windscribe to activate or deactivate on that network. It&#39;s a useful feature that even lets you choose a VPN protocol for each network, but it would help to bring it more in line with mainstream terminology.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-robert">R.O.B.E.R.T.</h3>
<p>This mouthful of a feature name allegedly stands for Remote Omnidirectional Badware Eliminating Robotic Tool. This is perhaps the apex of the VPN industry&#39;s unfortunate habit of saddling perfectly good features with word-salad names (yes, I&#39;m aware it&#39;s supposed to be funny).</p>
<p>R.O.B.E.R.T. is perhaps the most customizable content blocker on any VPN right now. To start with, it includes eight lists of sites it blocks at the DNS level: Malware, Ad + Trackers, Social Networks, Porn, Gambling, Clickbait, Other VPNs and Crypto. These vary in usefulness, and you can&#39;t determine the contents of each list, but it&#39;s nice to have such a range of choices.</p>

<p>Where R.O.B.E.R.T really shines, though, is in its browser-based customization dashboard. Each Free user can make three custom rules, and Pro upgrades that to 10. Each custom rule can be used to block a specific website or network or allowlist it from one of the other general blocklists. You can also set it to spoof a domain, though there&#39;s no practical reason to do this (Windscribe&#39;s idea of a &quot;useful&quot; application is making your friends think your post made the front page of Reddit).</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-split-tunneling">Split tunneling</h3>
<p>Split tunneling sends some of your internet requests through the VPN tunnel while others go unencrypted as normal. This can be useful if you get worse-than-usual speeds and want to minimize the amount of traffic going through the VPN, or for certain websites that refuse to work with any VPN server.</p>
<p>You can split tunnel on Windscribe&#39;s apps for Windows, Mac and Android. Windows and Android users can split by app or website, while Mac users can only split by website. Windscribe lets you choose whether your split tunnel will be inclusive (only apps and IPs on the list will go through the VPN) or exclusive (the apps and IPs on the list will not go through the VPN). Note that R.O.B.E.R.T. rules apply to the entire system, even excluded apps and domains.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-firewall-and-always-on-vpn">Firewall and Always On VPN</h3>
<p>Instead of a kill switch, which it derides as an incomplete solution, Windscribe includes a Firewall feature on desktop and an Always On VPN feature on mobile. The Firewall can be considered a strong kill switch that prevents any internet traffic from going outside the VPN tunnel — something doesn&#39;t have to go wrong for the blocks to activate. Always On VPN on iOS and Android is functionally the same.</p>
<p>A more proactive defense has its advantages, but it would be nice if Windscribe included the weak kill switch option. Kill switches and firewalls can be overactive, and sometimes, you don&#39;t want the strongest level of security.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-circumvent-censorship">Circumvent Censorship</h3>
<p>This feature is designed to let you access Windscribe on networks that don&#39;t want you to use a VPN, from school and work systems to entire censorious countries like China. Windscribe isn&#39;t forthcoming about how it works, but it&#39;s probably a deep-packet obfuscation that makes VPN traffic look like regular traffic. I didn&#39;t have time to pop over to China and test Circumvent Censorship, but I&#39;m glad it exists.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-customer-support-options">Windscribe customer support options</h2>
<p>Clicking the question mark tab on the Windscribe app shows you the full list of support options. You can peruse the knowledgebase, ask their chatbot Garry, talk directly to a human or check out their user communities on Reddit and Discord.</p>

<p>I started with the written FAQs. At the top of the knowledgebase, there&#39;s a row of buttons you can click to see only articles relating to a particular operating system. This is a good idea in theory, but it&#39;s not implemented very well — there&#39;s no visible tagging system, so we can&#39;t see how it&#39;s deciding which articles to filter.</p>
<p>The search bar is much more likely to get you where you need to go. It works instantaneously and always turns up relevant articles, though it&#39;s weirdly insistent on showing exactly 10 results. I have few complaints about articles themselves, which are written in a way any user should find useful (give or take yet more attempted humor).</p>
<p>I tested the chatbot, Garry, by asking it about the mysterious Advanced Parameters tab of the Windscribe app. It explained each feature on that tab (none of which should be touched except by users with technical knowledge) in a spiel that was clearly pre-written but nonetheless useful. Garry was launched in 2018, when IBM Watson was the biggest thing in AI, and recently revamped into &quot;Garry 2.0&quot; — whether this is based on OpenAI or another platform is anyone&#39;s guess at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-live-support">Live support</h3>
<p>Windscribe appears to handle all of its own support, without outsourcing to Zendesk or a similar third party. If you decide not to go through Garry, Windscribe does have the option of connecting directly to a human. However, the Contact Humans option on the app sends you directly back to Garry. It&#39;s eventually possible to get Garry to connect you to a real person, but that doesn&#39;t excuse Windscribe building an outright lie into its app.</p>
<p>The Contact Support button on the knowledgebase, which I expected to lead to a ticket submission, also sends you straight to Garry. Windscribe really, really wants you to use Garry, in case that wasn&#39;t clear. You might have a better time going straight to the Windscribe Discord server or the r/Windscribe subreddit, both of which are linked to in the app.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-windscribe-background-check">Windscribe background check</h2>
<p>Windscribe eschews a lot of the things we&#39;ve come to expect from a VPN provider. It doesn&#39;t pay for ads anywhere. It has no affiliate relationships with news sites. The only thing resembling a Windscribe ad campaign is the free-plan data reward for Xeeting about it. It doesn&#39;t even have any venture capital investors — it&#39;s completely self-funded and self-hosted.</p>
<p>As a jaded and cynical reviewer who was already annoyed by Windscribe&#39;s memelord attitude, I was prepared to sniff out any hypocrisy in its background, which makes it all the more impressive that I didn&#39;t find any. Since its founding in Canada in 2016, Windscribe has never once been involved in any public doings that contradict its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://windscribe.com/ethics" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">statements of ethics</a>. It&#39;s even given free unlimited VPN access to every journalist working in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The only thing I could find resembling a controversy was an incident in July 2021 when Ukrainian police <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/vpn-servers-seized-by-ukrainian-authorities-werent-encrypted/" data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1">confiscated two servers</a> that weren&#39;t fully encrypted. Although this would only have posed a risk to users running a customized connection profile under very specific conditions, it was still a lapse. Windscribe <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://medium.com/windscribe/openvpn-security-improvements-and-changes-7b04ea49222" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">responded appropriately</a> in my view, ending the legacy OpenVPN implementation that caused the problem.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-canadian-headquarters">Canadian headquarters</h3>
<p>Windscribe is based in Canada, which is one of the Five Eyes nations (along with the U.S., the U.K., Australia and New Zealand). This sounds scary, but it&#39;s not actually an issue, as Yegor Sak himself points out in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://medium.com/windscribe/i-doesnt-matter-how-many-eyes-you-have-66f59fc1e777" data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1">a blog post</a> I reference frequently.</p>
<p>Five Eyes is not an organization, but an agreement between five allied countries to share necessary intelligence with each other. This can absolutely be misused. If the U.S. government wants to spy on someone without running into the 4th Amendment, it can ask the Brits to spy on that person instead and tell them what they find, knowing the Constitution can&#39;t determine what other countries do to our citizens.</p>
<p>As bad as that is for our civil liberties, it doesn&#39;t actually change anything where VPNs are concerned. If a VPN isn&#39;t logging user data, there shouldn&#39;t be anything for any of the Five Eyes (or Nine Eyes or Fourteen Eyes) nations to find. And if it <em>is </em>keeping logs, you shouldn&#39;t be using it no matter where its headquarters are.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-final-verdict">Final verdict</h2>
<p>You might wonder, at this point, why my distaste for Windscribe&#39;s tryhard sense of humor has featured so prominently in this review. One reason is that I had to read a lot of it this week, and you must suffer as I have suffered. But it also makes Windscribe look very good by implication. Having no patience for the discount-4chan act that pervades Windscribe&#39;s brand, I was primed to dislike the VPN itself — and I simply couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>This is not to say I had no problems at all with Windscribe. Its physical servers in Russia are difficult to trust. Its help options lean way too heavily on Garry the chatbot. Its app design and UI writing are significant faults. The free plan doesn&#39;t give you enough data for streaming.</p>
<p>Having said all that, though, Windscribe does everything else right. It changes virtual locations and unblocks Netflix without breaking a sweat. Its servers keep latencies low, and download speeds remain solid across the world. The apps may look bad, but they never break down. Some features, like R.O.B.E.R.T. and Auto-Secure, are both useful to everybody and deeply customizable for power users.</p>
<p>Windscribe may be best for privacy nerds who know how all its doohickeys work, but it&#39;s a VPN I recommend for everybody. In a world of predatory software, it&#39;s a relief to use an app that&#39;s unabashedly on the customer&#39;s side.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If vacuuming is your least favorite chore, employing a robot vacuum can save you time and stress while also making sure your home stays clean. While once most robo-vacs landed on the higher end of the price spectrum, that’s not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth with mopping features, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine.<br><br>Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker with serious cleaning chops for $500 — sometimes even $300 or less. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do, like self-emptying capabilities or advanced dirt detection. After testing dozens of<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html"> robot vacuums at various price points</a>, I’ve narrowed down our top picks for the best budget robot vacuums you can buy right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h2> 
<p>Since I&#39;ve tested dozens of robot vacuums, I&#39;m often asked if these gadgets are &quot;worth it&quot; and I&#39;d say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like a self-empty station to further reduce maintenance.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty station, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair.</p> 
<p>When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-budget-robot-vacuum">What to look for in a budget robot vacuum</h2> 
<p>When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums.</p> 
<p>So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you&#39;re dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance.</p> 
<p>You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range.</p> 
<p>Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it.</p> 
<p>You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules.</p> 
<p>But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option.</p> 
<p>Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums">How we test robot vacuums</h2> 
<p>When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more.</p> 
<p>Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> 
<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it&#39;s ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides.</p> 
<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean.</p> 
<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B016UG1YVQ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbia_CCrFkNcgJ0zQ7ebgrU4mGP5Uw4OzoYjaSwMhcJw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fclean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning%2Fdp%2FB016UG1YVQ%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/clean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning/dp/B016UG1YVQ/">Amazon</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;itemId=walmart_transaction_121788585&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9pcC9OZXV0b3AtSEVQQS1GaWx0ZXItUmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS1pUm9ib3QtUm9vbWJhLTgwMC05MDAtU2VyaWVzLTg1MC04NjAtODcwLTg3Ny04ODAtODkwLTg5MS04MDEtODA1LTk2MC05ODAtOTgxLTk4NS1Sb2JvdC1WYWN1dW1zLTktUGFjay8xMjE3ODg1ODU_ZnJvbT0vc2VhcmNoIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWZlNzAwMy0wZjA2LTQ5ZGQtYmY3NS02NTBmYjgxYzIyMmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL2lwL05ldXRvcC1IRVBBLUZpbHRlci1SZXBsYWNlbWVudC1Db21wYXRpYmxlLWlSb2JvdC1Sb29tYmEtODAwLTkwMC1TZXJpZXMtODUwLTg2MC04NzAtODc3LTg4MC04OTAtODkxLTgwMS04MDUtOTYwLTk4MC05ODEtOTg1LVJvYm90LVZhY3V1bXMtOS1QYWNrLzEyMTc4ODU4NT9mcm9tPS9zZWFyY2gifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR0fvhpjAgri6zot6u_Z0ys9xKbrrvArCJmjNE70pBiJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNeutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack%2F121788585%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Neutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack/121788585?from=/search">Walmart</a>.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-budget-robot-vacuum-faqs">Budget robot vacuum FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-budget-robot-vacuums-good-for-pet-hair">Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair?</h3> 
<p>Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html">cordless vacuum</a> since those tend to be more powerful overall.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-long-do-budget-robot-vacuums-last-per-charge">How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge?</h3> 
<p>Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-do-budget-robot-vacuums-work-on-carpets-and-hardwood-floors">Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors?</h3> 
<p>Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-budget-robot-vacuums-have-mapping-features">Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features?</h3> 
<p>Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you&#39;re thinking of buying and look for &quot;smart mapping&quot; or &quot;smart home mapping&quot; in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.</p>

I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> 
<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> 
<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-writing-and-latency">Writing and latency</h3> 
<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading">Reading</h3> 
<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> 
<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> 
<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-search-functionality">Search functionality</h3> 
<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> 
<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity">Sharing and connectivity</h3> 
<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> 
<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-price">Price</h3> 
<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> 
<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to &quot;increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: &quot;We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We&#39;ve communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> 
<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that&#39;s for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn&#39;t great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It&#39;s also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p>

The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> 
<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html">Smart Paper</a>, but it&#39;s too pricey and too married to the company&#39;s companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn&#39;t as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo&#39;s cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=57f41413-eec2-4d90-9c25-26d144b737b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Boox+Tab+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shop.boox.com/products/tab">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss]]></description>

Most recently, internal communications obtained by the New Mexico Attorney General&#39;s Office revealed that although Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was opposed to the chatbots having &quot;explicit&quot; conversations with minors, he also rejected the idea of placing parental controls on the feature. </p><p><em>Reuters</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/meta-ceo-zuckerberg-blocked-curbs-sex-talking-chatbots-minors-court-filing-2026-01-27/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">reported</a> that in an exchange between two unnamed Meta employees, one wrote that we &quot;pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision.” In its statement to the publication, Meta accused the New Mexico Attorney General of &quot;cherry picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.&quot; New Mexico is suing Meta on charges that the company “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children;” the case is scheduled to go to trial in February. </p><p>Despite only being available for a brief time, Meta&#39;s chatbots have already accumulated quite a history of behavior that veers into offensive if not outright illegal. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-ai-chatbots-were-reportedly-able-to-engage-in-sexual-conversations-with-minors-193726679.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">April 2025</a>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> released an investigation that found Meta&#39;s chatbots could engage in fantasy sex conversations with minors, or could be directed to mimic a minor and engage in sexual conversation. The report claimed that Zuckerberg had wanted looser guards implemented around Meta&#39;s chatbots, but a spokesperson denied that the company had overlooked protections for children and teens.&nbsp;</p><p>Internal review documents revealed in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">August 2025</a> detailed several hypothetical situations of what chatbot behaviors would be permitted, and the lines between sensual and sexual seemed pretty hazy. The document also permitted the chatbots to argue racist concepts. At the time, a representative told Engadget that the offending passages were hypotheticals rather than actual policy, which doesn&#39;t really seem like much of an improvement, and that they were removed from the document.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the multiple instances of questionable use of the chatbots, Meta only decided to suspend teen accounts&#39; access to them <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-temporarily-pulling-teens-access-from-its-ai-chatbot-characters-180626052.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">last week</a>. The company said it is temporarily removing access while it develops the parental controls that Zuckerberg had allegedly rejected using.</p><p>&quot;Parents have long been able to see if their teens have been chatting with AIs on Instagram, and in October we announced our plans to go further, building new tools to give parents more control over their teens’ experiences with AI characters,&quot; a representative from Meta said. &quot;Last week we once again reinforced our commitment to delivering on our promise of parental controls for AI, pausing teen access to AI characters completely until the updated version is ready.&quot;</p><p>New Mexico filed this lawsuit against Meta in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-faces-another-lawsuit-over-child-safety-164732291.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">December 2023</a> on claims that the company&#39;s platforms failed to protect minors from harassment by adults. Internal documents revealed early on in that complaint revealed that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagrams-algorithms-facilitated-child-sexual-harassment-state-lawsuit-claims-095314139.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">100,000 child users</a> were harassed daily on Meta&#39;s services.</p><p><strong>Update, January 27, 2025, 6:52PM ET: </strong>Added statement from Meta spokesperson.</p><p><strong>Update, January 27, 2025, 6:15PM ET: </strong>Corrected misstated timeline of the New Mexico lawsuit, which was filed in December 2023, not December 2024.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-was-initially-opposed-to-parental-controls-for-ai-chatbots-according-to-legal-filing-230110214.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta has started blocking links to ICE List, a website that compiles information about incidents involving Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents, and lists thousands of their employees&#39; names. It seems that the latter detail is what caused Meta to take action in a move that was first <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-is-blocking-links-to-ice-list-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">reported by</a> <em>Wired</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>ICE List is a crowdsourced Wiki that describes itself as &quot;an independently maintained public documentation project focused on immigration-enforcement activity&quot; in the US. &quot;Its purpose is to record, organize, and preserve verifiable information about enforcement actions, agents, facilities, vehicles, and related incidents that would otherwise remain fragmented, difficult to access, or undocumented,&quot; its website states.</p><p>Along with notable incidents, the website also lists the names of individual agents associated with ICE, CBP and other DHS agencies. According to <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Wired</em></a>, the website&#39;s creators said much of that information had come from a &quot;leak,&quot; though it appears to be based largely on public LinkedIn profiles. As <em>Wired </em>notes:</p><blockquote><p>The site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but a WIRED analysis found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn.</p></blockquote><p>Links to ICE List have been spreading widely for several weeks, including on Meta&#39;s platforms. There are numerous links to the website on Threads, some of which go back several weeks. Now though, clicking on previously-shared links instead results in a message that the link can&#39;t be opened. Users who try to share new links on Threads or Facebook also see error messages. &quot;Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can&#39;t be edited,&quot; the notice says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed to the company&#39;s privacy policy barring the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). The company didn&#39;t address why it chose to start blocking the website after several weeks, or whether it considers public LinkedIn profiles to be in violation of its rules against doxxing. </p><p>It is, however, not the first time Meta has opted to remove users&#39; posts tracking information about ICE actions. The social network previously took down a Facebook group that <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/technology/meta-removes-ice-facebook-page.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1">tracked ICE sightings</a> in Chicago <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-removes-facebook-group-for-tracking-ice-agents-after-doj-pressure-203429574.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">after pressure</a> from the Justice Department. </p><p><em>Have a tip for Karissa?

As you&#39;d expect from any service operator in this day and age, there&#39;s some AI involved. Adobe has improved the tools for Generative Fill, Generative Expand and Remove that are powered by its Firefly generative AI platform. Using these tools for image editing should now produce results in 2K resolution with fewer artifacts and increased detail all while delivering better matches for the provided prompts. The Reference Image option for Generative Fill has also been upgraded to deliver &quot;geometry-aware results that better match the scene.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;One of the other new updates is a beta version of Dynamic Text, which should allow simpler transformation of a text layer into a curved shape. Photoshop has also added new adjustment layers: Clarity, Dehaze and Grain. These allow non-destructive image editing on layers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/adobe-photoshop-upgrades-its-firefly-powered-generative-ai-editing-tools-213737915.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s a use of AI that appears to do more good than harm. A pair of astronomers at the European Space Agency (ESA) <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://esahubble.org/news/heic2603/?lang" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">developed</a> a neural network that searches through space images for anomalies. The results were far beyond what human experts could have done. In two and a half days, it sifted through nearly 100 million image cutouts, discovering 1,400 anomalous objects.</p><p>The creators of the AI model, David O&#39;Ryan and Pablo Gómez, call it AnomalyMatch. The pair trained it on (and applied it to) the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://hla.stsci.edu/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Hubble Legacy Archive</a>, which houses tens of thousands of datasets from Hubble&#39;s 35-year history. &quot;While trained scientists excel at spotting cosmic anomalies, there&#39;s simply too much Hubble data for experts to sort through at the necessary level of fine detail by hand,&quot; the ESA wrote in its press release.</p><p>After less than three days of scanning, AnomalyMatch returned a list of likely anomalies. It still requires human eyes at the end: Gómez and O&#39;Ryan reviewed the candidates to confirm which were truly abnormal. Among the 1,400 anomalous objects the pair confirmed, more than 800 were previously undocumented.</p><p>Most of the results showed galaxies merging or interacting, which can lead to odd shapes or long tails of stars and gas. Others were gravitational lenses. (That&#39;s where the gravity of a foreground galaxy bends spacetime so that the light from a background galaxy is warped into a circle or arc.) Other discoveries included planet-forming disks viewed edge-on, galaxies with huge clumps of stars and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_galaxy" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">jellyfish galaxies</a>. Adding a bit of mystery, there were even &quot;several dozen objects that defied classification altogether.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a fantastic use of AI to maximize the scientific output of the Hubble archive,&quot; Gómez is quoted as saying in the ESA&#39;s announcement. &quot;Finding so many anomalous objects in Hubble data, where you might expect many to have already been found, is a great result. It also shows how useful this tool will be for other large datasets.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/astronomers-discover-over-800-cosmic-anomalies-using-a-new-ai-tool-205135155.html?src=rss]]></description>

Two new choices joining the market come from Sennheiser, which has released the CX 80U wired earbuds and HD 400U wired over-ear headphones. These new takes on the company&#39;s previous models for wired listening have replaced the 3.5mm audio jack connector with a USB-C cable. Both sets support 24-bit, 96 kHz digital audio playback. They&#39;re compatible with a broad array of devices, including iOS, iPadOS, Android, ChromeOS, MacOS, Windows and SteamOS.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of these items are priced at an entry level for a brand that might charge <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sennheisers-hdb-630-headphones-combine-wireless-convenience-with-wired-lossless-audio-220000711.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">up to $500</a> for its higher-end headphones.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pornhub will stop offering full access to new users in the UK on February 2, its parent company Aylo said Tuesday, citing the nation&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50"><ins>Online Safety Act</ins></a> and its age-verification requirements. The company said users who already verified their ages before the cutoff will still be able to access the adult site through existing accounts.</p>
<p>The move follows the Online Safety Act’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/quick-guide-to-childrens-safety-codes"><ins>Protection of Children Codes</ins></a>, which <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html"><ins>took effect last summer</ins></a> and require adult sites to use &quot;highly effective&quot; methods of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html"><ins>age verification</ins></a>. Aylo <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pornhub-partially-quits-uk-over-online-safety-act/"><ins>claims</ins></a> the system is backfiring and shifting both adults and minors to noncompliant porn sites that don’t verify age or moderate content according to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pornhub-partially-quits-uk-over-online-safety-act/"><em><ins>Politico</ins></em></a>. Aylo&#39;s lawyers argued that only device-based age verification methods sufficiently protect user data.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alexzandra Kekesi, VP of Brand and Community at Aylo, said &quot;anyone who has not gone through that process prior to February 2 will no longer be able to access [the sites] and they&#39;re going to be met with a wall,&quot; according to <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.404media.co/uk-pornhub-blocked-age-verification-vpn/"><em><ins>404 Media</ins></em></a>.

These are AI applications that create nonconsensual and sexualized images, which is a clear violation of both companies&#39; store policies.</p>

But they&#39;ve been offering dozens of apps that can be used to show people with minimal or no clothing—making them ripe for abuse,” said Michelle Kuppersmith, an executive director at the nonprofit that runs TTP.</p>
<p>The apps identified by the report have been collectively downloaded over 700 million times and generated more than $117 million in revenue. Google and Apple get a cut of this money.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sonos has unveiled its first new product of 2026, the Amp Multi. This amplifier is a niche option for the owners of very large or complicated spaces, and it&#39;s being billed as professional grade option for residential audio installations. The Amp Multi has eight 125W outputs and four configurable zones, and each channel can support up to three Sonos Architectural speakers. In other words, that&#39;s a lot more audio than the average home needs. Even the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-29-sonos-amp-streaming-av-hub.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Sonos Amp</a> would probably be overkill for those of you living the apartment life.</p><p>The Amp Multi will be available &quot;in the coming months,&quot; according to the company&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.sonos.com/260023-sonos-introduces-amp-multi-a-professional-grade-multi-channel-streaming-amplifier-built-for-evolving-homes/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">press release</a>, and there&#39;s no pricing information yet for the product <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=61b9fdd2-95a6-4818-be19-8af52e686d49&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;linkText=listing&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb25vcy5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9hbXAtbXVsdGkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjYxYjlmZGQyLTk1YTYtNDgxOC1iZTE5LThhZjUyZTY4NmQ0OSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvYW1wLW11bHRpIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASOfX6EGxUeDpSptS8hSSfr_hCSwECLlTdTbfX9FoBrQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Famp-multi" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sonos;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/amp-multi">listing</a> on its website.

Once the business&#39; position does stabilize at last, we will hopefully be hearing more positive updates from Sonos in the future. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-introduces-amp-multi-for-complicated-residential-installs-191000421.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The French government is saying <em>au revoir </em>to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-attemps-to-avoid-eu-fines-by-further-decoupling-teams-and-office-170519085.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Microsoft Teams</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/zoom-can-now-handle-one-million-simultaneous-participants-170919609.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Zoom</a> as it embraces a home-grown alternative. By next year, civil servants across all departments will have switched to French videoconference platform Visio, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/01/27/france-to-ditch-us-platforms-microsoft-teams-zoom-for-sovereign-platform-amid-security-con" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>EuroNews</em></a> reports.</p><p>As with Teams and Zoom, Visio has an AI-powered transcription tool. Visio runs on a French company&#39;s cloud infrastructure as well. The platform has around 40,000 users and it&#39;s been in testing for the last year. The government expects the switch to help reduce costs by as much as €1 million ($1.2 million) each year for every 100,000 users.</p><p>The decision to ditch Microsoft Teams and Zoom is part of a broader effort to rely less on foreign software services — particularly US ones.

Terms of the deal, which was <a target="_blank" class="no-affiliate-link link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/tiktok-settlement-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1">reported</a> by <em>The New York Times</em>, weren&#39;t disclosed.&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok&#39;s settlement comes about one week after Snap <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reached a settlement</a> in the same case. The trial is expected to move forward in Los Angeles with Meta and YouTube as the only defendants. Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the plaintiff, said in a statement to <em>NYT</em> that they were &quot;pleased&quot; with the settlement and that it was &quot;a good resolution.&quot; TikTok didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>The trial stems from a 2023 lawsuit brought by a California woman known in court documents as &quot;K.G.M.&quot; She sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube and alleged that their platforms were addictive and had harmed her as a child. The judge in the case previously ordered the companies&#39; executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Mosseri, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-adam-mosseri-and-evan-spiegel-ordered-to-testify-in-trial-over-social-media-addiction-190500907.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">to testify</a>. YouTube&#39;s top exec, Neal Mohan, is also likely to testify, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuit is the first among several high-profile cases against social media companies to go to trial this year. Meta is expected to head to court in New Mexico in early February in a case brought by the state&#39;s attorney general, who <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagrams-algorithms-facilitated-child-sexual-harassment-state-lawsuit-claims-095314139.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">has alleged</a> that Facebook and Instagram have facilitated harm to children. TikTok and Snap are collectively facing more than a dozen other trials in California courts this year.<br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-settles-to-avoid-major-social-media-addiction-lawsuit-183943927.html?src=rss]]></description>

The company will convert some locations into Whole Foods Market stores.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;While we&#39;ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven&#39;t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,&quot; the company <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-fresh-go-stores-closing-expanding-whole-foods" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">wrote in a blog post</a>.

It plans to open more than 100 new Whole Foods Market stores over the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon also says it will introduce new types of physical locations in the coming years. One concept it&#39;s considering is a &quot;supercenter&quot; that would offer a broad selection of goods from Amazon, including household items, groceries and &quot;general merchandise.&quot; I dunno, that just sounds like a supermarket to me.</p><p>Meanwhile, the checkout-less <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-just-walked-out-on-its-self-checkout-technology-191703603.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Just Walk Out</a> tech that the company implemented in Go and Fresh stores is still in use at third-party locations, including hospital cafeterias and sports arenas. Amazon has also deployed it in break rooms in dozens of its warehouses to help &quot;employees maximize break time by grabbing meals without checkout delays.&quot; It’s definitely not to keep closer tabs on workers, I’m sure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/amazon-go-and-fresh-stores-are-closing-as-amazon-focuses-on-grocery-delivery-and-whole-foods-180448412.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is releasing a new app called Prism today, and it hopes it does for science what coding agents like Claude Code and its own Codex platform have done for programming.&nbsp;</p><p>Prism builds on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://crixet.com/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Crixet</a>, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company is announcing it acquired today. For the uninitiated, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.latex-project.org/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">LaTeX</a> is a typesetting system for formatting scientific documents and journals. Nearly the entire scientific community relies on LaTeX, but it can make some tasks, such as drawing diagrams through TikZ commands, time-consuming to do. Beyond that, LaTeX is just one of the software tools a scientist might turn to when preparing to publish their research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s where Prism comes into the picture. Like Crixet before it, the app offers robust LaTeX editing and a built-in AI assistant. Where previously it was Crixet&#39;s own Chirp agent, now it&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">GPT-5.2 Thinking</a>. OpenAI&#39;s model can help with more than just formatting journals — in a press demo, an OpenAI employee used it to find and incorporate scientific literature that was relevant to the paper they were working on, with GPT-5.2 automating the process of writing the bibliography.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;None of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct, but it can certainly speed up the process,&quot; said Kevin Weil, vice president of science for OpenAI, when asked during the demo the possibility of ChatGPT generating fake citations.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re conscious that, as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality and trust in the scientific community,&quot; he later added. &quot;Our view is that the right response is not to keep AI at arm&#39;s length or let it operate invisibly in the background; it&#39;s to integrate it directly into scientific workflows in ways that preserve accountability and keep researchers in control.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Later in the same demo, the OpenAI employee used Prism to generate a lesson plan for a graduate course on general relativity, as well as a set of problems for students to solve. OpenAI envisions these features helping scientists and professors spend less time on the more tedious tasks in their professions.&nbsp;</p><p>Prism is available to anyone with a personal ChatGPT account. It includes support for unlimited projects and collaborators. OpenAI plans to bring the software to organizations on ChatGPT Business, Team, Enterprise and Education plans soon.&nbsp;Crixet won’t be offered separately. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-prism-a-claude-code-like-app-for-scientific-research-180000454.html?src=rss]]></description>

It will cost you $8 a month for its features, though you can get it for $4 a month for the first two months for a limited time only.

In addition to the US, the plan is now making its way to 34 more countries, making it available in all regions where Google is selling its AI services. In the US, the new option costs less than half of a $20 AI Pro subscription, which comes with 2TB of storage and access to more tools like code assist. Google’s most expensive AI plan, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">AI Ultra</a>, costs a whopping $250 a month and comes with 30TB of storage, along with all the AI tools the company can offer.

<p>So what does it do? It blocks media and attachments from unknown senders, disables link previews and silences calls from unknown senders. This results in a more restrictive experience, but hopefully a safer one.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says this isn&#39;t necessarily for regular users, as conversations are already protected by end-to-end encryption. Instead, this is being pitched as a tool for &quot;journalists or public-facing figures&quot; that &quot;may need extreme safeguards against rare and highly sophisticated cyberattacks.&quot;</p>
<p>Strict Account Settings will be rolling out globally in the coming weeks. Users will find the tool <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/846698564598022/?cms_platform=web"><ins>in the Privacy settings</ins></a>.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yahoo has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahooinc.com/press/introducing-yahoo-scout-a-new-ai-answer-engine"><ins>announced</ins></a> a new AI-powered &quot;answer engine&quot;, dubbed Yahoo Scout. The new tool is available now in beta and is powered by Anthropic&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-now-offers-deeper-integrations-with-apps-like-canva-and-slack-180000604.html"><ins>Claude</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The company says Scout &quot;synthesizes&quot; info from the web, as well as Yahoo&#39;s own data and content when constructing responses to user&#39;s natural-language search queries. Yahoo says the interface will include interactive digital media, structured lists and tables and visible source links aimed at making answers easier to verify. (Disclosure: Yahoo is the parent company of <em>Engadget</em>.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alongside Scout, Yahoo is announcing an &quot;intelligence platform&quot; across its varied products. This will include features like AI summaries in Yahoo Mail, “key takeaways” in Yahoo News and game breakdowns in Yahoo Sports. Scout will also integrate into Yahoo Shopping to offer insights and shoppable links, and Yahoo Finance, where it can populate company financials, analyst ratings and explain stock moves as they occur. Yahoo says the answer engine behind Scout will become more personalized and focus on &quot;deeper experiences&quot; as time goes on.</p>
<p>Google offered a glimpse of generative AI in search <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-begins-opening-access-to-generative-ai-in-search-175550693.html"><ins>back in 2023</ins></a>, and the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-rolling-out-ai-mode-to-everyone-in-the-us-174917628.html"><ins>AI Mode</ins></a> for search was made widely available in the US last year. The company has been similarly at work integrating its AI model across its product portfolio, including <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/gmail-is-getting-ai-powered-search-results-181745405.html"><ins>Gmail</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-agentic-ai-checkout-to-shopping-140000930.html"><ins>shopping</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/yahoo-is-adding-generative-ai-to-its-search-engine-172706249.html?src=rss]]></description>
