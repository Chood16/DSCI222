                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of 2025&#39;s splashiest games, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silksong-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-for-chinese-players-due-to-confusing-translations-162631762.html"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>, is getting its first major DLC expansion, developer Team Cherry <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">announced in a blog post</a>. The nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow update will come to the moody Metroidvania some time in 2026, and better still, it will be free for all players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DLC will include &quot;new areas, bosses, tools and more,&quot; the developer wrote. There aren&#39;t a lot of clues to the gameplay in the short trailer below, but the four shots definitely relay the vibe. The first shows what looks like fishing tackle, then we see something (or someone) on a tomb-like wooden platform tied under a canvas sheet. Next an orb-like structure crackling with electricity looms and finally the game&#39;s protagonist, Hornet, appears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In related news, Team Cherry gave updates on its Nintendo Switch 2 version of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> that will bring it up to visual parity with the the <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> Switch 2 edition. As part of that, the studio also released a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">beta update</a> to the Steam and GOG PC versions of the original Hollow Knight.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-dlc-pack-will-be-free-for-all-players-123055729.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time, I refused to upgrade my work-issued MacBook. I was leery of the hassle, and would much rather hang on to an aging Intel-powered laptop than have to transfer files, set up apps and sign in to accounts all over again. What did it matter if my notebook barely lasted long enough to cover an iPhone launch? My petty brain blamed it all on external factors (like being forced to use a MacBook instead of a PC), and left me dripping in stress as I watched the power levels dip down to zero at many of the live events I attend every year. So when I saw the <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DCBB2YTR&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f60d172b-bdff-4823-ba90-d510d97102f6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Laptop+Power+Bank&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRENCQjJZVFI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjYwZDE3MmItYmRmZi00ODIzLWJhOTAtZDUxMGQ5NzEwMmY2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRENCQjJZVFIiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWvAradhSm37fVZQjKe0UfTC2cW_0PPGtUP9BrLy72ay&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCBB2YTR" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCBB2YTR?th=1">Anker Laptop Power Bank</a> was one of the items in our Labor Day deals roundup this year, I decided to get one to alleviate my battery anxiety (instead of, you know, doing the sane thing and agreeing to a new laptop).</p>
<p>When I unboxed my new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-laptop-power-bank-review-all-my-favorite-battery-features-together-at-last-130036854.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Laptop Power Bank</a> the night before <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the iPhone 17 Pro launch</a>, I wasn’t expecting to be so taken by its features. All I knew before then was that this was a solid, beefy laptop battery pack, squeezing 25,000mAh in a compact package that would save me from having to worry too much about finding an outlet. But when I saw the screen light up with details on the amount of energy left (to two decimal places!) and the real-time charge data when I plugged it in, I was impressed. How modern!</p>
<p>Then I noticed the built-in cables — one retractable and neatly tucked inside the charger and the other artfully curved into a groove and doubling as a handle. Both wires were braided and felt like they’d be resistant to fraying and destroying themselves over time. Altogether, the general build quality and functionality of all the components made it clear this was a thoughtfully designed product worthy of all the praise and money we’ve hurled at it since my colleagues first tested it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what truly made me smile (and giggle, honestly) was a naughty little <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anker-power-bank-face-easter-egg" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Easter egg</a>. I saw posts on Threads indicating that if you tugged on that retractable cable and let it go in and out a few times, the screen would show a smiley face. I didn’t believe this was true until I saw it for myself. Sure, it felt a little bit odd, but I told myself I was revving a chainsaw, and doing legitimate testing for professional reasons, not jerking off a device. And when I saw the funny face appear, I felt the effect was humorous rather than pervy. The good news for the more staid readers is that if you don’t want to ever see that face, you never have to. And if you like cheeky little touches in your tech products, the Anker Laptop Battery Charger will delight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of how I felt about having pleasured a laptop battery charger, it doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a well-made, well-rounded product. It managed to get my MacBook a few extra hours, so I made it all the way to the end of a multi-hour keynote, though it did run completely empty so I couldn’t recharge my phone after. Blast Apple Park and its utter lack of available power outlets!</p>
<p>Anker’s Laptop Battery Pack effectively allayed my battery anxiety, brought me some mirth and won me over with its thoughtful design. And because I got it on sale, it was $90 well spent.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iRobot, the company that brought robotic vacuum cleaners to homes and popular culture, has filed for  <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html">bankruptcy</a>. It plans to sell all assets to its primary supplier, the Chinese company Picea Robotics. Investors “will experience a total loss and not receive recovery on their investment” if the deal is approved, iRobot said. The company didn’t discuss how the move might affect its employees in the US or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped its $1.7 billion acquisition of the company last year after a veto threat from European regulators, leaving the Roomba maker with no other option. Political scrutiny came on two fronts: The company was also reportedly hit hard by Trump’s tariffs in Vietnam, where it manufactures products for the US market.</p>
<p>iRobot launched its first Roomba in 2002, arguably inventing the world of robot vacuums — and the first robots to enter many of our homes. Competition from rivals has chipped away at its dominance, with other companies coming in at both lower and higher prices, like Roborock, Dyson and Anker’s Eufy.</p>

<p>IKEA’s revamp of its smart home products doesn’t end with Matter support. It also has some new Qi wireless chargers. First up, the $10 VÄSTMÄRKE combines a PopSockets-style phone grip with cable storage in a donut-shaped package.</p>
<p>It can magnetically attach to iPhones with MagSafe or Pixel phones with Google’s Pixelsnap magnets. Then there’s the $25 VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger with lighting, a bowl-shaped charging pad in the center for your smartphone or wireless earbuds.</p>

<p>LG says it will unveil its LG Micro RGB evo TV at CES 2026, but ahead of that, it shared some preliminary information about the screen. Instead of just white lights, Micro RGB means the backlight can be any hue, thanks to individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs, offering a wider color array. This approach is midway between OLED’s individual-pixel lighting and TVs that use typical mini-LEDs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s nothing more frustrating than shooting the perfect reel only to realize that the audio sounds like garbage. For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.<br><br>We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording!</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-phone-mics-for-2026-best-wireless-mics-for-creators">Best phone mics for 2026: Best wireless mics for creators</h2> 
<p>“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera. They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-mobile-microphones">How we test mobile microphones</h2> 
<p>The world of mobile microphones has exploded in recent years thanks to affordable, high-quality wireless systems, the popularity of social media and content creation and, of course, Apple’s reluctant switch to USB-C on the iPhone which has removed connectivity complications for manufacturers.</p> 
<p>When it comes to testing, my experience as a journalist, podcast producer, YouTuber and (failing) music producer has given me a lot of real-world experience with a wide variety of products all aimed at different jobs. When compiling this guide for Engadget, I filter that experience down to a few simple criteria that allows us to focus on what’s important to you, the reader and whatever it is you’re trying to record.</p> 
<p>The main criteria for mobile microphones are simple: Does it sound great? Does it connect to a phone directly and reliably? And, is it good value for its intended purpose? A hobbyist and a professional have different budgets after all.</p> 
<p>What <em>every</em> microphone endures is repeated recording in treated, non-treated and outdoor environments. I’ll also A/B test each one against its rivals and usually a suitable reference microphone — Shure’s SM7b for podcasting microphones or Rode’s NTG 5 for shotgun/video mics, for example.</p> 
<p>Some sub-categories of microphone require a slightly different approach. For wireless systems, I test how far I can walk from the receiver before recordings degrade, along with a standard battery life test by setting them to record until they power off. For podcast and vocal-focused microphones, I record in different spaces to see how they cope with different environments and measure self noise (recording “silence”). Lastly, I test how they sound when recording at different distances from the microphone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is getting in on one of the newest trends for televisions with the introduction of Micro RGB. The company will unveil the LG Micro RGB evo at CES 2026, but it shared some preliminary information about the screen today.</p>
<p>Micro RGB is a newer screen technology where rather than white lights, the backlight can be any hue thanks to individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs, offering a wider color array. This approach is a mid-way point between the precision of OLED with its individual pixel lighting, but it offers an upgrade over screens only using mini LEDs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The television is also equipped with an upgraded engine for AI upscaling. According to the company&#39;s press release, the LG Micro RGB evo is certified by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB. The TV has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control.</p>
<p>The few other brands currently using micro RGB are charging a pretty penny for it; the one announced by Samsung earlier this year <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html"><ins>costs $29,999</ins></a>. At 115 inches, the Samsung version is also much larger than LG&#39;s offerings, which include options at 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches. Although the size is reduced, expect the eventual prices for the LG Micro RGB evo to also be very expensive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Louisiana law that would have required social media platforms to verify the ages of their users has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Louisiana-MSJ_Granted.pdf" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">been blocked</a> by a judge. The law, known as the Secure Online Child Interaction and Age Limitation, was passed in 2023 and required Meta, Reddit, Snap, YouTube Discord and others to implement age verification and parental control features.</p><p>The ruling came just days before the law, which technically took effect over the summer, would have started to be enforced. In his ruling, Judge John W. deGravelles wrote that the law&#39;s &quot;age-verification and parental-consent requirements are both over- and under-inclusive,&quot; and that its definition of &quot;social media platform&quot; was &quot;nebulous.&quot;</p><p>The ruling was a victory for NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents the tech industry and has challenged the growing number of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">age verification laws</a> around the world. The group had argued that the law was unconstitutional and posed a safety and security risk.</p><p>In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://netchoice.org/netchoice-wins-permanent-block-of-louisiana-age-verification-law-protecting-free-speech-and-parental-rights/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a statement</a> following the ruling, the group pointed to the &quot;massive privacy risk&quot; posed by the Louisiana law and others like it. &quot;Louisiana’s law would have done more than chill speech,&quot; Paul Taske, the co-director of NetChoice’s Litigation Center said. &quot;It would have created a massive privacy risk for Louisianans like those playing out in real time in countries without a First Amendment, like the UK.&quot;</p><p>The Louisiana Attorney General&#39;s office didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/judge-blocks-louisianas-social-media-age-verification-law-001212758.html?src=rss]]></description>

The latest place you may find Copilot is on your LG smart television, whether you want it or not.</p>
<p>Several LG smart TV owners have taken to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/my_lg_tvs_new_software_update_installed_microsoft/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/tv-providers/lg-tv-update-adds-non-removable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-webos"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> over the past few days to complain that they suddenly have a Copilot app on the device and cannot uninstall it. Two <em>Engadget</em> staffers discovered the app on a 2022 LG OLED and a 2023 UA8000. They confirmed that the app can&#39;t be removed, although they were able to hide it from the home screen. One other person from our team also has a 2022 LG OLED but isn&#39;t seeing Copilot, so your mileage may vary based on what permissions and privacy settings you already have set up with LG.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just last month, Ford seemed to be on the brink of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-may-not-resume-production-of-the-f-150-lightning-221903848.html"><ins>sunsetting</ins></a> the F-150 Lightning. Today, the vehicle manufacturer <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/next-gen-f-150-lightning-extended-range-electric-vehicle"><ins>announced</ins></a> plans to reboot the truck as a hybrid. This next generation of the F-150 Lightning will contain Extended Range Electric Vehicle. An EREV is similar in concept to a plug-in hybrid but with a larger battery that&#39;s topped up by a gas generator — the powertrain itself is all electric. This next generation of the F-150 Lightning will offer an estimated range of more than 700 miles. Production will end this year on the current F-150 Lightning models.</p>
<p>This revamp of the F-150 Lightning is part of Ford&#39;s latest approach to electric vehicles. The company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-reinvests-trucks-hybrids-affordable-electric-vehicles"><ins>projected</ins></a> that by 2030, half of its global volume will be comprised of hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles, compared with 17 percent today. &quot;As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,&quot; the company&#39;s press release states. Ford will also swap its planned electric commercial van for North America with a new, affordable commercial van that has both gas and hybrid options. The company anticipates seeing a $19.5 billion negative impact for this pivot away from EVs.</p>

The holidays can truly sneak up on you, and this year that’s been more true than ever.

<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>So you want to give someone a gift but you don’t have a ton of cash to spare. Don’t fret because first, you’re not alone, and second, there are tons of options to choose from. Especially if you’re looking in the tech space, it can feel especially daunting to find a gadget that’s affordable but also worth gifting — in other words, not a piece of junk that will eventually take up residence at the bottom of a drawer. But you don’t have to drain your wallet to get someone a cool gadget that will both be useful and make their lives easier. We’ve collected our favorite pieces of tech under $25 that make great gifts and help you to stick to a budget.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items.

Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these.

<p>Subscription boxes are the rare gift that keeps its charm long after the wrapping paper is gone. You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects.

It&#39;s set to hit Prime Video 20 months after the first batch of episodes. As it turns out, the season two premiere is going to arrive a little earlier than you may have anticipated as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first episode will now hit Prime Video at 9PM ET on December 16. That&#39;s six hours earlier than expected. So if you&#39;ve been looking forward to catching back up with Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul, you won&#39;t have to stay up as late on Tuesday night to catch the premiere as soon as it&#39;s available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, you won&#39;t be able to binge the entire season this week. While Amazon dropped all of <em>Fallout</em> season one at once in April 2024, this time around it will release episodes on a weekly cadence through February 4.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="0985088a39184e8684c6ce75fee3fa74"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4J91kh56jiA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em> has a new release window. The survival extraction shooter was originally set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-shares-first-looks-at-gameplay-from-its-new-shooter-marathon-alongside-a-release-date-213530509.html">in September</a>, but by June, Sony had <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-delays-marathon-indefinitely-190832450.html">delayed it indefinitely</a>. Now, with a plagiarism issue largely in the rearview mirror, Bungie has <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">confirmed</a> that <em>Marathon </em>will arrive in March and and plans to sell it for $40.</p>
<p>Alongside the release date and price announcement, Bungie released a 23-minute video that takes a deep dive into the game and shows off the current state of <em>Marathon. </em>New features include proximity chat and a solo mode, while Bungie says it has upgraded the environmental storytelling and visual fidelity. Gritty environments provide a nice contrast to the glossy sci-fi sheen that defined <em>Marathon</em>’s visual language in our <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-revives-marathon-as-a-multiplayer-shooter-212630605.html">earliest looks at the game</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There’s a lot more on deck for <em>Marathon</em>’s first year including new maps and events. Bungie also plans to release more shells, which are akin to character classes that can be customized by changing your loadout. The Rook shell, for instance, is a new one that the studio has added since the alpha playtests. This shell allows you to join a run that&#39;s already in progress. You’ll have a limited loadout, but you’re not really risking anything valuable as you run around to loot items.</p>
<p>There’s a lot riding on <em>Marathon</em>. Parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment said last month that <em>Destiny 2</em> had <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-says-destiny-2-has-not-met-expectations-200000610.html">not lived up to its expectations</a> and it wrote down the value of Bungie’s assets by $204 million. Back in August, Sony asserted more control over Bungie and said the developer was “shifting into a role that is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios.”</p>
<p>That’s hardly the only issue Bungie has faced this year. The studio <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungie-admits-its-marathon-alpha-included-stolen-artwork-210006323.html">admitted</a> in May that one of its former employees plagiarized the work of artist Fern Hook by enabling it to be used in <em>Marathon</em>’s in-game textures. Earlier this month, Hook said that Bungie and Sony had resolved the matter “to my satisfaction.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-in-march-200838426.html?src=rss]]></description>

The deal is expected to close on December 16</p><p>There’s no release date as yet for <em>March of Giants</em>. Amazon announced the free-to-play game back in August and there was a closed alpha playtest the following month. The next playtest will take place in 2026.  The next major update for <em>March of Giants </em>will include “new giants, expanded competitive modes and foundational systems designed to support long-term growth.”</p><p><em>March of Giants </em>is a 4v4 game in which players control giant war commanders. You’ll lead armies with thousands of soldiers and send them to attack enemy giants. Likewise, you’ll have to fend off the other team’s minions. You can also deploy reinforcements (called Battleworks) like trenches, tanks and bunkers to help you win a match.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>MOBAs aren’t entirely new territory for Ubisoft.

Although it clearly sees an opportunity in the MOBA market, Ubisoft will have a job on its hands to make <em>March of Giants </em>succeed in a space that’s dominated by <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p><em>March of Giants </em>was in development at Amazon Games Montreal, a studio that was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1924600?emclan=103582791475278691&amp;emgid=530982192097001777" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">established five years ago</a>. Several former Ubisoft employees are returning to that company as part of this deal. Many of them were part of the original creative team behind <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, including Amazon Games Montreal founder and <em>March of Giants  </em>creative director Xavier Marquis.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazon-sells-moba-march-of-giants-to-ubisoft-183948291.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Merriam-Webster <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year"><ins>has selected</ins></a> &quot;slop&quot; for the dictionary company&#39;s 2025 word of the year. The leading lexicographers define slop as &quot;digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.&quot; We&#39;ve seen an absolute deluge of AI slop this year, from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/movie-studios-have-been-making-serious-money-from-ai-slop-on-youtube-160434252.html"><ins>fake movie trailers on YouTube</ins></a> to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html"><ins>AI-generated bands on Spotify</ins></a>. Not even food delivery like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-eats-is-stuffing-ai-slop-into-your-meal-174413765.html"><ins>Uber Eats</ins></a> could escape the onslaught of AI-generated garbage that no one asked for.</p>
<p>It&#39;s gotten to the point that half the videos my well-meaning parents send me on social media are AI-generated videos of dogs. This isn&#39;t all that surprising given how very intentionally the social media giants have <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-now-has-a-feed-for-ai-slop-205751808.html"><ins>added slop to all our feeds</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Merriam-Webster rightly points out the somewhat mocking nature of calling it “slop.” &quot;Like <em>slime</em>, <em>sludge</em> and <em>muck</em>, <em>slop</em> has the wet sound of something you don&#39;t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything. The original sense of the word, in the 1700s, was &#39;soft mud.&#39; In the 1800s it came to mean &#39;food waste&#39; (as in &#39;pig slop&#39;), and then more generally, &#39;rubbish&#39; or &#39;a product of little or no value,&#39;&quot; the dictionary distributors wrote.</p>
<p>As the proliferation of AI slop expanded, some platforms like <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-will-let-users-tone-down-the-amount-of-ai-content-in-their-feed-050100596.html"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/pinterest-will-let-you-dial-down-ai-slop-in-your-feeds-130000337.html"><ins>Pinterest</ins></a> got wise and began offering users the choice to tone down the sheer amount of it in their feeds. Even Spotify is at <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html"><ins>least trying</ins></a> to combat some of this stuff now, though that didn&#39;t stop an <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/an-ai-copycat-of-king-gizzard--the-lizard-wizard-went-unnoticed-on-spotify-for-weeks-220018144.html"><ins>AI-generated copycat</ins></a> from going unnoticed on the platform for weeks. Elsewhere, companies like Google leaned in, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-is-adding-the-veo-3-video-generator-to-youtube-to-slopify-shorts-155339183.html"><ins>incorporating</ins></a> Veo 3-generated videos into YouTube Shorts. We&#39;ll only be able to tell in hindsight if 2025 was the peak of AI slop, but for now it shows no signs of abating.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a white elephant gift exchange at work this year or with friends and family, there’s a good chance you’re scrambling right now to find a good gift — or decipher what even makes a good white elephant gift. The possible origins of the term “white elephant” provide one way of looking at it: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>Whether or not that story is true, it gives us one way of looking at a white elephant gift: something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, there are plenty of other ways of interpreting this strange yet delightful tradition. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-white-elephant-faqs">White elephant FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-is-white-elephant">What is white elephant?</h3> 
<p>A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-how-does-white-elephant-work">How does white elephant work?</h3> 
<p>A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-is-it-called-white-elephant">Why is it called white elephant?</h3> 
<p>The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><p>There&#39;s a growing sentiment that gadgets have gotten boring. And while I don&#39;t fully agree, I understand why people might feel that way.

And although big names like Google, Microsoft, Meta and others continue to dump billions into AI development, the first wave of dedicated AI devices was an <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/rabbit-r1-review-a-199-ai-toy-that-fails-at-almost-everything-161043050.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">abject</a> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">failure</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When you think about it, the only new(ish) class of gadget that has made major inroads to the mainstream market is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">smartwatches</a>. That said, because they&#39;ve evolved into wearable health and fitness sensors instead of the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-01-samsung-galaxy-gear-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">wrist-based computers</a> that many once thought they would be, they haven&#39;t really disrupted our lives like the personal computer and smartphone did. But that seems poised to change because the tech giants have decided that smart glasses are going to be the next big thing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="b6b76640-a45b-4e16-8ffc-9fd7447f3ae6">Headsets versus smart glasses, what’s the difference?</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Galaxy-XR-lead.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Galaxy-XR-lead.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Google is planning to support both smart glasses and headsets with Android XR, though the increased size and weight of devices like the Galaxy XR means it&#39;s not a great choice for all-day functionality. " data-uuid="62ad870e-3b20-4115-8d20-39474904feba"><figcaption>Google is planning to support both smart glasses and headsets with Android XR, though the increased size and weight of devices like the Galaxy XR means it&#39;s not a great choice for all-day functionality. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>At this point, you might be saying, &quot;Wait, hold on. Aren&#39;t VR headsets and smart glasses kind of the same thing?&quot; Well, yes and no. Both types of gadgets require similar software and hardware, but they utilize them in very different ways. Not only are VR goggles typically much bigger and heavier, they also provide a more isolated experience that can make it feel like you&#39;ve been transported to another world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, most modern headsets have exterior cameras that support some level of mixed reality (blending virtual graphics with physical objects) or let you peek quickly into meatspace (passthrough view) for when you need to get a drink or acknowledge other humans in the room. But in many respects, that closed-off feeling is the goal because it creates the ideal environment for playing games, taking virtual meetings or modeling 3D objects without real-world distractions. Furthermore, while many headsets like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Vision Pro</a> and the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">Meta Quest 3</a> can function as standalone systems and support accessories like controllers or other motion trackers, they can also be tethered to a nearby PC for enhanced functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ys2v-LZ08Uw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>On the other hand, the default use case for smart glasses is a mixed reality environment where the spectacles can overlay helpful info or messages while you stay active and aware of your surroundings. Notably, while smart glasses might come with lenses or clip-on attachments that allow them to get darker or serve as sunglasses when you&#39;re outside, there typically isn&#39;t a way to completely block out the world like you can with a headset, mostly because that&#39;s simply not the point. And even though most smart spectacles can be paired with a phone to get access to mobile data or notifications, they&#39;re generally not meant to be tethered to a PC full-time (though there are some exceptions). The goal for smart glasses is more to provide a mobile-first heads-up display that augments what you see with your eyes instead of replacing things entirely with a digital environment.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="272f4729-7a74-4dc9-8c3a-7244ab393a93">OK, but what makes you so sure that smart glasses are &quot;it?&quot;</h2><p>Now that we&#39;ve discussed what separates smart glasses from headsets, what makes it so obvious that they are going to be the next big thing? This one is a bit easier to answer because we can simply look at the sheer number of companies that have released smart glasses or are planning to do so in the future. If we skip past the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-30-google-glass-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">Google Glass</a> from 2013 as forward-thinking specs that were ahead of their time, the most well-known example of modern smart glasses is the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban</a> (or the even earlier <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">Ray-Ban Stories</a> from back when Facebook was still Facebook).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/meta_display_glasses_and_case.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/meta_display_glasses_and_case.jpg" style="height:1280px;width:1920px;" alt="While they are a bit chunky, the Meta Ray-Ban Display are some of the most sophisticated smart glasses on the market right now due in large part to their single full-color screen.

While Apple hasn&#39;t publicly announced plans to make its own smart glasses, <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> Mark Gurman — who is one of the company&#39;s most reliable analysts — provided inside info earlier this fall that Tim Cook and Co. are planning to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-01/apple-shelves-vision-headset-revamp-to-prioritize-meta-like-ai-smart-glasses" data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1">pivot away from a proper follow-up to the Vision Pro</a> in favor of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-12/inside-apple-s-glasses-pivot-when-apple-is-launching-m5-macbook-pro-ipad-pro" data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1">more lightweight spectacles with greater mass appeal.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>This shouldn&#39;t really come as a major surprise, as <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-10-31/apple-s-ai-and-vision-pro-products-don-t-meet-its-standards" data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1">sales of Apple&#39;s $3,500 headset have been lackluster</a>. But more importantly, for a company that&#39;s extremely cautious about entering new product categories (foldable iPhone anyone?), it feels very telling to hear that Apple is shifting to smart glasses instead of abandoning the idea of wearable displays entirely. This is a company that doesn&#39;t swing and miss very often, so the idea of two flops in a row seems preposterous. If this pivot is real, there must be some Apple execs who are big believers that glasses and not goggles are the right choice for future development.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google-reference-design-lead.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google-reference-design-lead.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Here are two of Google&#39;s reference model smart glasses.

If true, that could become a trillion-dollar market in the next 10 to 15 years (or sooner, who knows), which not only makes it a natural avenue for expansion but possibly a future existential crisis for certain companies. After all, none of these organizations want to be the next Microsoft after it failed to develop a successful smartphone or mobile OS.</p><h2 id="405957a3-3393-44ea-8f87-391514683ccf">Fine, the smart glasses trend is real, but why would we even want them?</h2><p>At this point, I hope it&#39;s clear that the push for smart glasses is very real and very serious. But so far, we&#39;ve only addressed why companies are betting big on them. So what&#39;s in it for us, the people who might actually buy and use them? Well, to answer that, we need to separate the current models into three main categories.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google_maps_on_smart_glasses.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/google_maps_on_smart_glasses.png" style="height:802px;width:1375px;" alt="A great use case for smart glasses would be to provide heads-up mapping without the need to constantly look down at your phone.

The best example of this class of devices is the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html" data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> (or the original Ray-Ban Stories) along with rivals like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-02-bose-frames-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:30;pos:1">Bose Sound Frames</a>, which, believe it or not, have been <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-02-bose-frames-review.html" data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1">on the market since 2019.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>However, before anyone gets attached to these early models, the simplest smart glasses already kind of feel like dinosaurs and will probably, in the not-too-distant future, go extinct. They were an interesting attempt to add things like music playback or photo and video capture to regular-looking sunglasses, but their limited feature set puts a clear ceiling on what they can do. Plus, if this is what people really wanted, they would have taken off already.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/waveguide.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/waveguide.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Waveguides like the ones built into the Even Realities G2  project images directly onto their lenses allowing for super sleek glasses featuring a heads-up display.

Most often, these models rely on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZum_COPUek" data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1">waveguide displays</a> as they enable thinner and lighter designs while propagating images onto the glasses&#39; lenses. Currently, most of these smart glasses feature single-color optics (usually green) to reduce complexity and power draw, but there are others like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ9IsB72nVk" data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> and both the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRUONuvydyY" data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1">TCL RayNeo X2</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhtWtdeQKfk" data-i13n="cpos:38;pos:1">X3</a> that support full color.</p><p>In this day and age when everyone is surrounded by screens, the idea of yet another display mounted inches away from your eyeballs might sound like the last thing you want. However, because modern smart glasses are much more discreet and less awkward-looking, I find that they can actually help cut down on distractions. That&#39;s because instead of having to peek down at your phone or smartwatch to check notifications, reply to messages or look up directions, you can do many or all of these things using smart glasses — all in the middle of a conversation without anyone noticing.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does this keep your focus where it should be — on people instead of gadgets — the glasses are also just as easy to wear as a smartwatch and far more comfortable than bulky VR headsets. Then, when you consider some other features of modern smart glasses like on-the-fly translation, the ability to function as a teleprompter hidden in plain sight or additional support from AI, suddenly you have a wearable that allows you to keep all of your other devices neatly stashed away. In many respects, smart glasses could be the portable displays that people might not even know they want.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/birdbath-optics.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/birdbath-optics.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="Compared to rivals with waveguides, glasses featuring &quot;birdbath&quot; optics are often significantly thicker and bulkier.

The exception to that comes from a subclass of specs that are primarily designed to function as wearable monitors capable of supporting one or more virtual screens that can be in excess of 100 inches in size, relatively speaking.&nbsp;</p><p>The most well-known smart glasses in this category come from <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xreals-new-one-pro-ar-glasses-are-surprisingly-good-143034826.html" data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1">Xreal</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8c02a657-370e-4f96-91c9-3ae0263a1751&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Viture&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52aXR1cmUuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGMwMmE2NTctMzcwZS00Zjk2LTkxYzktM2FlMDI2M2ExNzUxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52aXR1cmUuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdClUeT5t15KmQhOHxmO6XxFr6hOA3pugd8HB6DQ9Pj0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viture.com%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:40;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.viture.com/">Viture</a>, with both companies offering a range of models with varying levels of performance. One interesting thing to note is instead of waveguides, some of these smart glasses rely on birdbath optics. This means instead of projecting an image into the lens itself, they use a beamsplitter and mirror to reflect images into your eye. The benefit of this is that you get good image quality from components that cost less than an equivalent waveguide setup, with the downside being increased light loss, potentially lower brightness and a much thicker design. This results in chunky frames that often look like they are sitting too far away from your face, which might not be immediately apparent if you see someone using them from afar. But up close, they don&#39;t look quite right. Or at least they don’t look like a pair of &quot;normal&quot; glasses.</p><p>Another issue is that due to more light loss, birdbath smart glasses require darker lenses (similar to sunglasses), which means they aren&#39;t great for wearing all day in a variety of environments. And because we still don&#39;t really have a great protocol for wireless displays (though it looks like Valve may be cooking up something with the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html" data-i13n="cpos:41;pos:1">Steam Frames</a>), most of these&nbsp; need to be connected by wire to a nearby PC. So you plug them in, put them on, get your work done and then you take them off.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/xreal_project_aura.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/xreal_project_aura.png" style="height:820px;width:1677px;" alt="Project Aura is Xreal&#39;s next-gen smart glasses and they feature a large 70-degree field of view and fancy electrochromic lenses.

On top of being smaller and more portable, they provide additional privacy when working in public spaces like a cafe or plane, which is what prompted a doctor friend of mine to get a pair instead of going with a portable display. And for the gamers out there, because they can be connected to a phone or even a portable PC or Switch 2 (with the proper dock, of course), they&#39;re great for people who might not have room for or access to a big screen TV.</p><h2 id="5a8ca801-1287-4f8b-9c26-18f36606ec1f">So where do we go from here?</h2><p>Ultimately, I think all three types of smart glasses will merge into one as engineers perfect the tech and steal ideas from one another, though there will surely be plenty of room for more niche designs. But more importantly, if we consider the types of gadgets most people carry around today, it boils down to just a handful of devices: a smartphone, some type of wireless audio (either earbuds or headphones) and maybe a health and fitness tracker of some kind (typically a smartwatch or smart ring).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/9cac4941-5d44-11ee-bdee-5c0451e0e194.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/9cac4941-5d44-11ee-bdee-5c0451e0e194.jpg" style="height:576px;width:960px;" alt="The Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses from 2023 raised a ton of awareness for the category, because even without any built-in displays, the combination of good-looking frames with onboard speakers and a camera was rather compelling. " data-uuid="de9ceabe-d0be-453a-b4e0-4258441e25fa"><figcaption>Even tough they didn&#39;t have a built-in display, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses from 2023 raised a ton of awareness for the category.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Smart glasses have the potential to really round out that kit by allowing us to keep most of those devices in our pocket while the wearables serve up helpful info when we need it, but without being overly intrusive or distracting. In the short term, you&#39;ll still need a laptop for work, but smart glasses may have a role to play there too, as they can provide way more screen space than a traditional physical display (even the new-fangled flexible ones). It might never happen, but I wouldn’t rule out a future scenario where your next employer gives you a company-issued phone and a pair of smart glasses and that&#39;s it.&nbsp;</p><p>Before that happens though, there are still a bunch of other things that need to be figured out. Without help from a mouse or keyboard, navigating a virtual display is a bit of a challenge. AI combined with hand and eye tracking can help, but no one has really nailed that combo yet. Not even Apple could do so on the much bulkier Vision Pro. To address this, Meta created a<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://youtu.be/gZ9IsB72nVk?t=23" data-i13n="cpos:42;pos:1"> bracelet (they call it a neural band)</a> that pairs with the Ray-Ban Display that can detect subtle movements so you can type or navigate menus practically anywhere. Even Realities opted for a ring accessory that does some basic health monitoring and comes with a tiny touchpad. In the more distant future, this hurdle may be solved by BCIs (brain-computer interfaces), but even the most optimistic view suggests that those aren&#39;t going to be mainstream for a long time.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EDITH_glasses.png" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/EDITH_glasses.png" style="height:526px;width:905px;" alt="Even though we&#39;re still a long ways away, one day everyone might be able to have something like Tony Stark&#39;s E.D.I.T.H. smart glasses from the Marvel Universe.

The idea of a single-purpose bracelet that doesn&#39;t track your health or do anything else sort of feels like a step backwards. And there&#39;s the problem of Meta&#39;s glasses being largely tied down to its own platforms (i.e. Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook), which may end up being a major hindrance after rivals like Google and Apple catch up.</p><p>And then there&#39;s the cost. Right now, a pair of Meta Ray-Ban Displays (which thankfully come with the wristband) costs $800. That&#39;s a lot for what is basically a publicly available beta test. But when you consider that an Even Realties G2 and an R2 ring costs even more at $850, it&#39;s clear that wearing smart glasses is going to be a very expensive hobby for at least the next few years. And while more single-purpose smart glasses from Xreal and Viture are a bit more affordable, with models ranging from $400 to $550 or $600, they still aren&#39;t cheap. On top of that, getting prescription lenses for smart glasses can often be a major pain in the ass and may not even be an option for people with more limited eyesight.&nbsp;</p><p>But those are problems for another day. And just because tech giants are pouring billions into the development of smart glasses doesn&#39;t mean they will be a guaranteed hit. If you care about tech, alongside AI and possibly EVTOL aircraft (aka flying taxis), pay attention to the advancements in smart glasses. Otherwise, you could miss out on what might be the next major wave in sci-fi gadgetry made real.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. Between <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">The Game Awards</a> and showcases like <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-world-premieres-and-other-hotness-from-the-game-awards-2025-day-of-the-devs-stream-200000447.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Day of the Devs</a>, Wholesome Snack, Latin American Games and Women-Led Games, there’s been a ton of video game news over the last week (I need <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-resonant-steps-into-a-larger-world-thats-inspired-by-neon-genesis-evangelion-021310781.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Control Resonant</em></a><em> </em>ASAP, please and thank you, Remedy). And hey, guess what? I&#39;ve got even more for you to dig into, including info on some new releases that you can play right now.</p><p>One of those is a game I’d been looking forward to since about 2022, and it’s always nice when something you’ve remained patient for turns out to be worth the wait. In Sam Eng&#39;s <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/skate-story-finally-arrives-on-december-8-160911918.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Skate Story</em></a>, you play as a demon who accepts a deal offered by the Devil. If the demon can ride a skateboard to the Moon and swallow it after being transformed into a creature made of “glass and pain,” the Devil will grant them their freedom.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M79A27qQXAs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It’s just as strange as that setup sounds. While you’ll need to execute combos to defeat bosses, this is a skateboarding game that leans more heavily on story than pure gameplay. It’s visually and sonically arresting too, with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zvv8G7NfDM" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Blood Cultures</a> and John Fio crafting a killer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/65067/Skate_Story_Echoes_of_the_Underworld/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">soundtrack</a> I know I’ll be listening to for a long time to come.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Skate Story</em> is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/skate-story-switch-2/" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1">Steam</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014385/" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">PS5</a> for $20. PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members can <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/skate-story-grinds-its-way-to-playstation-plus-on-december-8-193034939.html" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1">play it at no extra cost</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="43f585e5-6ea2-438e-ac9b-165ff04a4ebd">New releases</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vkvi71znX_Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Unbeatable </em>is another game I’ve had on my radar for some time, though I haven’t had a chance to jump in yet. This is another stylish game in which you play as Beat, who sings in a band. However, music is outlawed in this world (oh no!). Through rhythm-based minigames and battles with cops, Beat tries to bring back the music. There&#39;s a separate arcade mode with a dedicated progression system too.</p><p>I&#39;m a sucker for stories about rebellious underdogs, and this rhythm adventure could well hook me in. <em>Unbeatable — </em>from D-Cell Games and publisher Playstack — is available on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1">Steam</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009766/" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1">PS5</a> for $28 (there’s a 10 percent discount on Steam until December 23). It&#39;s set to hit Xbox Series X/S very soon too.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nnzX8szNnAk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Speaking of games I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on, <em>Adrift </em>(from solo developer S.K.9.8 and co-publisher Secret Sauce) was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remastered-eldritch-terror-a-fantasy-life-sim-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110015794.html" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1">one of the first games I covered</a> when I started doing this weekly roundup earlier this year. It&#39;s a driving game in which your aim is to deliver a volatile energy core. Since you&#39;re traversing a hot desert, you&#39;ll need to be careful to prevent the core from overheating and blowing up. Thankfully, there are safe spots and cooling stations where you can bring down the temperature.</p><p>The vaporwave aesthetic of <em>Adrift </em>caught my eye and although I dig the presentation, the game isn&#39;t quite clicking for me in the early going. It didn&#39;t take long before my vehicle got stuck and I had to reset, and I&#39;m finding the top-down world a little confusing to navigate. I&#39;ll stick with it for at least a little longer, though. <em>Adrift </em>is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2903570/ADRIFT/" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1">Steam</a>. It usually costs $13 though there&#39;s a 25 percent discount until December 23.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xwVCkhRH4k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;ve very happy that a game like <em>Drywall Eating Simulator </em>can exist. Peripheral Playbox&#39;s satirical walking sim sees your character trying to deal with the maddening realities of daily life and the frustration that one may find in dealing with other people. Get mad enough and you&#39;ll be able to punch through a wall (something you&#39;ll have to do to move through the levels anyway). Then, you can munch on some drywall to calm yourself down.</p><p>I had a good time with it and there’s some pointedly funny writing here. “I thought AI sucks but it told me that was wrong and I believed it,” says one person. That&#39;s all well and good, but I mainly just want the NPCs to leave me alone so I can eat drywall in peace. <em>Drywall Eating Simulator </em>is out now on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3749110/Drywall_Eating_Simulator/" data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1">Steam</a>. It&#39;ll usually run you $10, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until December 17.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRCL22TXE6k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Planet of Lana </em>was one of my favorite games of 2023 and now it&#39;s available on <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a3925d37-3259-4d94-98b0-fdbaaed3ac80&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9wbGFuZXQtb2YtbGFuYS9pZDY3MzkxMzAwNDkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEzOTI1ZDM3LTMyNTktNGQ5NC05OGIwLWZkYmFhZWQzYWM4MCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvcGxhbmV0LW9mLWxhbmEvaWQ2NzM5MTMwMDQ5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfwN5uUL_mJKtJKP9HPvrJrbM_owNLGaPpkkJKn-ksul&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fplanet-of-lana%2Fid6739130049" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:16;pos:1" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planet-of-lana/id6739130049">iOS</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a3925d37-3259-4d94-98b0-fdbaaed3ac80&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Android&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLnBsYXlkaWdpb3VzLnBvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTM5MjVkMzctMzI1OS00ZDk0LTk4YjAtZmRiYWFlZDNhYzgwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLnBsYXlkaWdpb3VzLnBvbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdoS5yXBeigmsKvIV6MkFmsbspXbMUKAeyNwIPZJ4Vlu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.playdigious.pol" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:17;pos:1" data-original-link="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.pol">Android</a> for $9. It sees teenage Lana and her cute companion Mui making their way through a world that&#39;s been taken over by alien robots as they try to rescue Lana&#39;s sister.</p><p>This is a puzzle platformer in the vein of <em>Inside </em>and <em>Limbo</em>, and despite the pretty and often bright presentation, it&#39;s just as dystopian as those games. It sounds gorgeous too, thanks in large part to a beautiful score from <em>The Last Guardian</em> composer Takeshi Furukawa.

It&#39;s a narrative-driven sci-fi narrative game in which you&#39;ll infiltrate swanky parties thrown by wealth hoarders in the future to steal spoils back from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Violence isn&#39;t the solution here, as you&#39;ll need to charm the ultra-rich, who buy elections and have &quot;monopolized AI development to ensure machines serve their interests&quot; (I dunno, this all seems extremely far-fetched). You can spin up a web of lies about things like how your husband died and how much <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sam-altmans-worldcoin-startup-is-dropping-the-coin-and-doubling-down-on-orbs-232105287.html" data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1">Worldcoin</a> you have. To maintain your ruse, you&#39;ll need to keep your story straight by remembering what you said and to which characters.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rUJLILF6GU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Okomotive (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/surfing-sand-and-sea-herding-beasts-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110053175.html" data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1"><em>Herdling</em></a><em>, Far: Changing Tides</em>) just revealed its next game. <em>PinKeep</em> is a roguelike deckbuilder in which you&#39;ll place structures on a playing field to fend off enemies. To collect resources, you&#39;ll need to play some pinball. By using the flippers (and flicking the ball for more precise movement), you can pick up what you need to fight back against your opponents. You can damage bad guys directly with the balls too.&nbsp;</p><p>As a <em>Ball x Pit </em>enthusiast with a tepid but growing interest in deckbuilders, this speaks to me. A <em>PinKeep</em> demo is coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4143700/PinKeep/" data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1">Steam</a> in January, with the full game set to arrive late in 2026.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZkyyvLZfao?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>AudioMech </em>is a neat-looking game that popped up for the first time during the pre-show of The Game Awards. This is a rhythm-based action title from Dylan Fitterer, the creator of <em>Audiosurf</em>. It taps into whatever music you have playing on your computer (even something that you&#39;re streaming or playing through a microphone) to customize both your weapons and opponents.</p><p>A track that&#39;s heavy on bass might give you a longer sword, while vocals and lead instruments can power a cannon. There are several ways to play, including a mode in which you don&#39;t take damage and a boss rush option. <em>AudioMech </em>is coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3925150/AUDIOMECH_your_music_transformed/" data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1">Steam</a> and there&#39;s a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4211230/AUDIOMECH_Demo/" data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1">demo</a> available now.&nbsp;</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5UKolYcKr8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Let&#39;s wrap things up with something a little more relaxing. <em>Lost and Found Co</em>. is a hidden object game from Bit Egg Inc. and co-publisher Gamirror Games. During the latest Wholesome Snack showcase, it was revealed that the game is coming to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101390/Lost_and_Found_Co/" data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1">Steam</a> on February 11.</p><p>It&#39;s little wonder that more than 170,000 Steam users have wishlisted this game. It looks absolutely lovely. The developers sought to recapture the &quot;magic&quot; of childhood puzzle books in their hand-drawn world. Here, you&#39;ll help Ducky, a duck-turned-human intern at a startup that hunts for items that townspeople have lost. There&#39;s a demo available that features the option to decorate a part of the world using items you find.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/swallowing-the-moon-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-154937071.html?src=rss]]></description>

The clip begins in the aftermath of the action-packed ending to the first bunch of episodes, with bodies and blazes surrounding Will as he says in a voiceover, &quot;We failed. We never stood a chance.&quot; However, his mother Joyce tells him that, &quot;This is not over. Not by a long shot.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>We learn in this trailer that some of the gang who were still in the Upside Down at the end of part one make it back to their own reality. However, it appears that we’re about to learn a whole bunch of new information about the deadly alternate dimension. Dustin says, &quot;This whole time, everything we have ever assumed about the Upside Down has been dead wrong.&quot;</p><p>In addition, the clip shows some of the heroes going on the offensive against a militarized area; Max and Holly making their way through the &quot;mental prison&quot; they&#39;re trapped in; Demodogs attacking the Hawkins hospital; and Eleven asking Eight to help her find and kill Vecna. There&#39;s also a death pact between Dustin and Steve, a look at an ominous new pulsating mass from the Upside Down and Vecna stating, &quot;It is time for a new world.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s a lot going on in this trailer and we won&#39;t have to wait too much longer for the next three episodes.

One of our favorites is a bit cheaper to sign up for right now: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f9cd69a7-2172-4476-a391-04d87e530174&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY5Y2Q2OWE3LTIxNzItNDQ3Ni1hMzkxLTA0ZDg3ZTUzMDE3NCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARwktSmO4PJU9ssHMWNW1CNwqCBkDSTAXrkQ5R7F7InQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarch.com/">Monarch Money</a> is offering 50 percent off annual subscriptions for new users.

<p>Monarch Money was the runner-up in our <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">guide</a> to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way.</p> 
<p>All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi.

<p>In our <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html">hands-on review</a>, we gave the Meta Quest 3S a score of 90, noting how impressive the tech was compared to its price. The headset was comfortable to wear during longer gaming periods, and the performance was quick and responsive thanks largely to the upgraded processor and increased RAM from the Quest 2.</p> 
<p>We were big fans of the new controllers, which the 3S shares with the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html">more expensive Quest 3</a>. This new generation of controller sports a more refined design, shedding the motion tracking ring and leaving behind a sleek form factor that fits in your hand like a glove.</p> 
<p>We did miss the headphone jack, though most users are probably fine with the built-in speakers. You can wirelessly connect headphones for higher quality sound if you feel the need. The Quest 3S also recycles the old Fresnel lenses from the Quest 2, which can lead to some artifacts.</p> 
<p>If you were considering a VR headset for yourself or a loved one this holiday season, the Meta Quest 3S offers an excellent value alongside impressive performance.</p>

Samsung helped change that this fall, with the release of its P9 Express series of microSD Express cards, and now one of them is on sale.</p>

<p>Uber is calling its new wrap-up feature, which launches today, &quot;YOUBER&quot;, and it takes into consideration both your Uber and Uber Eats usage. You can see where you went, how often you demanded Uber Comfort, and how frequently you returned to the same pizza place on Uber Eats. If you rank in the top one percent of a specific restaurant’s customers, YOUBER is going to tell you all about it, whether the realization fills you with shame or not.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are also 14 &quot;Uber Personality Profiles&quot; that you could be assigned, such as &quot;Do-Gooder&quot; for the Uber Electric loyalists, &quot;Rise &amp; Shiner&quot; for the early morning riders, and &quot;Delivery Darling&quot; for those who &quot;live for deliveries of all kinds.&quot; Uber lets you share your results straight from YOUBER using the &quot;Share this Story&quot; button from within the app.</p>
<p>YOUBER is available to Uber and Uber Eats customers in the US from today, and can be accessed from your homescreen or account page.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/even-uber-has-an-end-of-year-wrap-up-now-120035274.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iRobot, which brought robotic vacuum cleaners to the masses with its iconic Roomba models, has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://media.irobot.com/2025-12-14-iRobot-Announces-Strategic-Transaction-to-Drive-Long-Term-Growth-Plan">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. The Massachusetts-based company plans to sell all assets to its primary supplier, a Chinese company known as Picea Robotics. If approved by a bankruptcy court, the move would allow iRobot to &quot;continue&nbsp;operating in the ordinary course, pursue its product development roadmap, and maintain its global footprint,&quot; iRobot wrote in a press release.</p>
<p>The company expects the deal to close in February 2026, but says it will continue to operate &quot;with no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships or ongoing product support.&quot; That means your Roomba should continue to clean normally and you&#39;ll be able to get consumables and replacement parts.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, investors of common stock &quot;will experience a total loss and not receive recovery on their investment&quot; if the deal is approved, iRobot stated. The company didn&#39;t discuss how the move might affect its employees in the US or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankruptcy seemed a likely outcome for iRobot after Amazon <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-abandons-14-billion-irobot-acquisition-after-eu-veto-threat-140155112.html">dropped</a> its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-buys-irobot-roomba-creator-122257453.html">$1.7 billion acquisition</a> of the company last year following a veto threat by European regulators. The company&#39;s fortunes continued to decline and it issued a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/irobot-has-new-roombas-but-it-doesnt-sound-confident-itll-be-around-to-sell-them-191747458.html">statement to investors in March 2025</a> that it had &quot;substantial doubt about [its] ability to continue.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a sad turn of events for the company that <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-06-08-gadget-rewind-2004-irobot-roomba-discovery.html">invented</a> the robotic vacuum niche and launched its first product, the Roomba, back in 2002. It dominated that space for more than a decade, but its market size has steadily shrunk more recently, particularly since Covid, due to competition from rivals like Roborock and Dreame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though iRobot retooled its product lineup earlier this year with new models like the Roomba 105 Vac Robot series and Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot + AutoWash Dock, but they failed to move the sales needle enough. The company was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/irobot-enters-chapter-11-lender-acquire-roomba-maker-2025-12-15/">reportedly</a> hit hard by Trump&#39;s 46 percent tariff in Vietnam where it manufactures products for the US market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the sale is approved, iRobot says it will return in force. &quot;Today&#39;s announcement marks a pivotal milestone in securing iRobot&#39;s long-term future,&quot; said CEO Gary Cohen. &quot;The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re several chapters into a novel and forgot who a character was, Amazon is hoping its new Kindle feature will jog your memory without ever having to put the e-reader down. This feature, called <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/books-and-authors/kindle-recaps-feature-ebook-series-refreshers">Ask this Book</a>, was announced during Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/everything-announced-at-amazons-fall-hardware-event-143557140.html">hardware event</a> in September, but is finally available for US users on the Kindle iOS app.</p>
<p>According to Amazon, the feature can currently be found on thousands of English best-selling Kindle titles and &quot;only reveals information up to your current reading position&quot; for spoiler-free responses. To use it, you can highlight a passage in any book you&#39;ve bought or borrowed and ask it questions about plot, characters or other crucial details, and the AI assistant will offer &quot;immediate, contextual, spoiler-free information.&quot; You&#39;ll even be able to ask follow-up questions for more detail.</p>

<p>While Ask this Book may be helpful to some Kindle readers, the feature touches on a major point of contention with authors and publishers. In response to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2025/12/kindles-new-ask-this-book-uses-generative-ai-to-create-an-in-book-chatbot-without-permission-or-rights/"><em>Publishers Lunch</em></a>, a daily newsletter for the publishing industry, an Amazon spokesperson said that, &quot;To ensure a consistent reading experience, the feature is always on, and there is no option for authors or publishers to opt titles out.&quot; Other AI companies are already facing lawsuits claiming copyright infringement. Most recently, the New York Times and Chicago Tribune <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-new-york-times-and-chicago-tribune-sue-perplexity-over-alleged-copyright-infringement-153656431.html">sued Perplexity</a>, accusing the AI company of using its copyrighted works to train its LLMs.</p>
<p>As for the Ask this Book feature, Amazon is already planning to expand it beyond the iOS app and will introduce it to Kindle devices and the Android OS app next year. Beyond this new feature, Amazon also introduced Recaps to Kindle devices and the iOS app for books in a series, which acts much like a TV show&#39;s &quot;Previously on&quot; roundup in between seasons. However, Amazon recently had to withdraw its AI-generated <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-pulls-its-bad-ai-video-recaps-after-fallout-fallout-220358758.html">Video Recaps</a> feature, so it might be worth double-checking the info you get from Recaps, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/kindles-in-book-ai-assistant-can-answer-all-your-questions-without-spoilers-190609961.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Close enough, welcome back <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-28-sony-ericsson-xperia-play-review.html">Xperia Play</a>. After releasing a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ayaneos-first-smartphone-could-have-physical-shoulder-buttons-182033773.html">teaser video</a> in early November, Ayaneo fully revealed its first smartphone called the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVDNGMIlzmI">Pocket Play</a>. As suspected, the Ayaneo Pocket Play features a sliding mechanism that transforms it from a chunky smartphone into a gaming handheld.</p>
<p></p>


<div id="ccb51c10fcfb4b4cb9a65e6877da7169"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVDNGMIlzmI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div></div>
<p>In its gaming configuration, the Pocket Play features a controller setup with a D-pad, ABXY buttons and four shoulder buttons. However, Ayaneo has modernized the Xperia Play design by incorporating two touchpads, which will also be seen in the handheld maker&#39;s next flagship device called the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ayaneo-next-ii-is-a-hulking-gaming-handheld-with-a-9-inch-display-175018940.html">Next II</a>. According to Ayaneo, you can map these touchpads as virtual joysticks or customizable inputs.

According to an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-back-in-development/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a> report, a new game for the Alien franchise is back in development. The report&#39;s sources mentioned that the single-player game will be set in a &quot;decaying space station&quot; as an arcade survival horror that can be compared to &quot;Shadow of [the] Tomb Raider with Xenomorphs.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time we heard about this Alien game, which was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/">first reported</a> on in 2022 under the codename &quot;Marathon.&quot; According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, the game has cycled through several developers, but more recently landed with Eidos Montreal, which developed <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> and is currently working on the upcoming <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-has-delayed-its-fable-reboot-until-2026-173118802.html"><em>Fable reboot</em></a>. The report added that the game&#39;s development budget was increased to less than $75 million, up from the initial $30 million budget from a few years ago.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Insider Gaming</em>&#39;s report noted that the game is still in &quot;early development,&quot; but could feature Ripley 8, the human-Xenomorph hybrid that was first seen in <em>Alien Resurrection.</em> The game&#39;s details and release date are still subject to change, but <em>Insider Gaming</em>&#39;s sources said the game is &quot;in a good place at this point&quot; and is expected to release in 2028 on all platforms.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-aaa-game-for-the-alien-franchise-is-back-in-the-works-204401214.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html">Half-Life fans</a> are nothing if not patient. For the diehard fans out there, the latest test of patience comes from <em>Insider Gaming Weekly</em>&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA">podcast</a>, which claimed that the third installment in the Half-Life franchise is set to release with the launch of the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html">Steam Machine</a> sometime in spring 2026.</p>
<p>&quot;The window I was specifically told was spring 2026 for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, for Half-Life 3,&quot; Mike Straw, one of the hosts of the <em>Insider Gaming Weekly</em> podcast and senior editor at <em>Insider Gaming</em>, said. &quot;At the end of the day, the game is real.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Straw added that all the previous dates for an announcement of the next Half-Life game have passed, but that his sources &quot;are still adamant this is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.&quot; However, being tied to Valve&#39;s latest hardware release could be an issue since Straw noted that the explosive jump in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html">RAM pricing</a> is causing considerable concern for the Steam Machine&#39;s pricing announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a concern, however, they haven&#39;t made a decision on price, which is kind of holding back the announcement of anything else,&quot; Straw said. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what&#39;s going on on the component side.&quot;</p>
<p>While optimistic devotees were hoping for some teasers during <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html">The Game Awards</a>, Valve hasn&#39;t officially said anything.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has released <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123075">iOS 26.2</a>, bringing a number of new convenience features and security updates. The update includes auto-generated chapters for episodes in the Podcasts app, the option to make AirDrop more secure using verification codes, alarms for Reminders and more. It also introduces new controls for how Liquid Glass appears on the Lock Screen, adding a slider to adjust the transparency level. The drop also includes updates for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123074">iPadOS</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106336">macOS</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123002">watchOS</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123024#a262">visionOS</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106336">tvOS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-whats-new-in-ios-262-and-ipados-262">What's new in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2</h2>
<p>It's not exactly a major update feature-wise, but iOS and iPadOS 26.2 bring a bunch of quality of life improvements to apps including Apple Music, Podcasts and Games. In Apple Music, you'll now see your Favorite Songs playlist in the Top Picks section, and lyrics will be available offline for songs you've downloaded. In addition to automatically generated chapters, Podcasts will display links to any other podcasts mentioned in the episode you're listening to. And, Games is getting in-game score banners, along with filters for the library to make it easier to find titles based on category and other descriptors. Apple says it also improved support for Backbone and Razer controllers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With iOS 26.2, Apple made Safety Alerts for natural disasters and other emergencies more detailed, and they'll now come with maps of affected areas and other useful information. For iPad users, Apple has added drag-and-drop gestures for its new windowing system to make multitasking smoother. The update for iPhones and iPads also addresses several potential <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125884">security issues</a>, including vulnerabilities in WebKit that Apple says "may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26." So, if you're not yet running the latest OS on your iPhone and iPad, it's a good time to update.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-os-updates-for-the-rest-of-the-family">OS updates for the rest of the family</h2>
<p>Beyond the iPhone and iPad, macOS Tahoe 26.2 introduces Edge Light for Mac, which <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-next-macos-update-can-turn-your-screen-into-a-ring-light-234410504.html">turns your display into a ring light</a> for video calls. For the Apple Watch, 26.2 fixes an issue with stuck songs in the Music app, and adds some new controls for the Sleep app. The tvOS update brings the option to add profiles even for people who don't have an Apple Account, and new restriction options for kid profiles. With visionOS 26.2, Travel Mode now has settings for cars and buses, and you'll now be able to use spatial accessories including "Logitech Muse in Notes, Freeform, and any PencilKit-enabled app" to create hand-drawn content with the Apple Vision Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-262-is-here-with-another-liquid-glass-tweak-new-podcasts-features-and-more-181020133.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though Nintendo made some serious upgrades with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-best-feature-is-its-satisfying-joy-con-2-thunk-150031872.html">Joy-Con 2</a>, you still might end up ditching them for CRKD&#39;s Nitro Deck 2. After winning over Nintendo Switch owners with its first <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/crkd-nitro-deck-review-the-switch-has-never-felt-this-good-130041763.html">Nitro Deck</a>, CRKD followed it up with an improved design that works for both the original Switch and the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-arrives-on-june-5-at-450-140642208.html">Switch 2</a>.</p> 
<p>To refine the original design, CRKD added several upgrades to the Nitro Deck 2 based on community feedback. The new-and-improved accessory features the company&#39;s CaptiStick Technology, which prevents stick drift and isn&#39;t affected by magnetic interference like other <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/crkds-nitro-deck-plus-review-140047889.html">Hall effect joysticks</a>. CRKD also offset the right thumbstick and contoured the outer shell for a more ergonomic feel. The Nitro Deck 2 is keeping the swappable stick top feature, but CRKD added the ability to swap out the D-Pad for even more customizability. At the back of the Nitro Deck 2, CRKD managed to squeeze in extra L2 and R2 shoulder buttons alongside the programmable back buttons, which were first seen with the predecessor.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t own a Switch 2 yet, the Nitro Deck 2 features a new retractable locking mechanism that can be adjusted to fit both the original Switch and Switch OLED. The Nitro Deck 2 supports a low-latency wired mode thanks to an included adapter, but you can also connect the devices through Bluetooth. Thanks to its wireless connection, the Nitro Deck 2 even works as a controller with PC, mobile or smart TVs.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It looks like Disney wasted no time delivering on CEO <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-may-start-hosting-user-generated-ai-videos-185000745.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Bob Iger’s promise</a> to bring AI-generated content to Disney+. On Thursday, the company announced the start of a three-year licensing <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-openai-sora-agreement/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">agreement with OpenAI</a> to bring more than 200 of its beloved characters, including those from Star Wars and Pixar, to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-app-is-real-but-youll-need-an-invite-to-try-it-171849671.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Sora app</a> and ChatGPT.  With the deal in place, OpenAI users will be able to prompt ChatGPT to generate images that tap into Disney’s intellectual property, with costumes, props, vehicles and environments covered. </p><p>The agreement does not include voices or “talent likenesses,” meaning Sora users won’t be able prompt the app to make a video with Black Widow and get something with Scarlett Johansson in it. Instead, both Sora and ChatGPT will only have access to animated and illustrated versions of Marvel and Star Wars characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Han Solo, Darth Vader and others. Disney will stream “curated selections” of Sora-generated fan videos on Disney+. Sora and ChatGPT users will be able to start generating images and videos with Disney characters starting in early 2026.    </p><p>“Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”</p><p>Disney has also agreed to become an OpenAI customer, promising to use the company’s APIs to build new products, tools and experiences. Additionally, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI, with the option to purchase additional equity down the road. OpenAI recently completed a <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-completes-corporate-reorganization-with-support-from-microsoft-133109385.html" data-i13n="slk:restructuring;cpos:4;pos:1">restructuring</a> to become more of traditional profit-seeking corporation, clearing the way for a potential IPO sometime in the next year or so. Still, the pact <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">brings together two unlikely bedfellows</a> who have been on opposite sides of the copyright debate. </p><p>Reaction from the entertainment industry was mixed. In <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wgawest.bsky.social/post/3m7qhlzd6js2x" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a statement released on Bluesky</a>, The Writers Guild of America, which represents writers across film, television and other media, made it clear it is unhappy with the deal:</p><blockquote><p>“Disney’s deal with OpenAI appears to sanction its theft of our work and cedes the value of what we create to a tech company that has built its business off our backs. We will meet with Disney to probe the terms of this deal, including the extent to which user-generated videoes will use the work of WGA members. We will continue to fight to protect our members’ creative and economic interests in the context of AI technology.”</p></blockquote><p>SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors union which has around 160,000 members worldwide, was less incendiary. It <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/disney-openai-dealgoogle-notice" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">posted a notice on its site</a> saying that both Disney and OpenAI had reached out to the union to give “their assurances that they will meet their contractual and legal obligations to performers.” The union noted it would “closely monitor the deal and its implementation to ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice, and likeness.”</p><p><strong>Update, December 11, 5:45PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publish to include comment from the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The $10 VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger is reminiscent of a bagel or donut, if you could take the top half of those ring-shaped foods and turn them inside out to create a cozy grip for your fingers. That same red silicone design also makes for a perfect place to store the charger's built-in USB-C cable, according to IKEA's product page, and otherwise acts as a playful replacement for what can be a pretty boring smartphone accessory.</p>

<p>IKEA has had multiple different ideas over the years for how smart home tech should integrate with its minimalist and user-friendly furniture. The company's partnership with Sonos <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-and-ikea-end-their-partnership-130052348.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">ended in May 2025</a>, which produced lights and picture frames with smart speakers built-in. Since then, the company has announced <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-goes-all-in-on-matter-with-new-smart-home-products-144232740.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">a new Bluetooth speaker</a> and started rolling out a new collection of Matter-connected remotes, lights and sensors.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is rolling out new Gemini-assisted <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/search/gemini-capabilities-translation-upgrades/">functionality</a> to Search and its Translate app. It says its AI can now provide more natural and accurate text translations for phrases that have more &quot;nuanced meanings.&quot;&nbsp; Translate will now take slang terms and colloquial expressions into consideration rather than provide sometimes unhelpful direct translations.</p>
<p>The latest update to its text translation feature is rolling out first in the US and India, translating between English and just under 20 other languages, including German, Spanish, Chinese and Arabic. It works in the Translate app for iOS and Android and on the web.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gemini’s speech-to-speech translation feature has also been updated, so you can now hear real-time translations in your headphones, like with Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html"><ins>AirPods Pro 3</ins></a>. Google says the new functionality, which is now in beta in the Translate app for Android (iOS is coming next year) in the US, tries to &quot;preserve the tone, emphasis and cadence of each speaker&quot; so you better understand the direction of the conversation and who said what. It works with any headphones and supports more than 70 languages.</p>
<p>Finally, Google is adding more tools to its potentially Duolingo-rivaling AI-powered language learning tools, which it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translates-latest-feature-is-its-take-on-duolingo-160035157.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> to the Translate app in August. Like Duolingo, Translate can now track how many days in a row you’ve been attempting to learn a new language, so you can check your progress over time. Whether it will nag you as persistently as the Duolingo owl famously does for slacking off is not clear.</p>
<p>The feedback feature has also been improved, so you should receive more useful tips on how you’re pronouncing words or phrases. Germany, India and Sweden are among the 20 new countries that can now use these educational tools.</p>
<p>After not showing it much love for a while, Google has been busy adding new features to Translate recently. As well as the new language practice feature, an update last month added the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-translate-now-offers-gemini-assisted-translations-151008774.html"><ins>ability</ins></a> to select between &quot;Fast&quot; and &quot;Advanced&quot; translations that allow you to prioritize speed when you’re in a rush (ordering a drink at the bar, for example) or receiving more accurate translations using Gemini.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translate-is-now-better-at-translating-slang-terms-and-idioms-using-ai-173428316.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Id Software, the company behind Doom, has voted in favor of forming a &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; union. The term &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; refers to a union that includes every employee, regardless of duties. The vote wasn&#39;t unanimous, though a majority did vote in favor of the union.</p>
<p>The union will work in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which is the same organization involved with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/zenimax-and-microsoft-ratify-union-agreement-224148192.html">parent company ZeniMax&#39;s recent unionization efforts</a>. Microsoft, who owns ZeniMax, has already recognized this new effort, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa">according to a statement by the CWA</a>. It <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-cwa-forge-labor-neutrality-agreement-covering-all-zenimax-workers-212643324.html">agreed to a labor neutrality agreement</a> with the CWA and ZeniMax workers last year, paving the way for this sort of thing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,&quot; id Software producer and CWA committee member Andrew Willis wrote in a statement to Engadget.</p>
<p>From the onset, this union will look to protect remote work for id Software employees. &quot;Remote work isn’t a perk. It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being,” said id Software Lead Services Programmer Chris Hays. He also said he looks forward to getting worker protections regarding the &quot;responsible use of AI.&quot;</p>
<p>Workers at id began organizing around 18 months ago, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/">according to a report by <em>Aftermath</em></a>. Things sped up after Microsoft <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-have-been-shut-down-183913558.html">closed several Bethesda studios</a> in the middle of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity and dedication these workers bring to every project,&quot; said CWA Local 6215 President Ron Swaggerty.</p>
