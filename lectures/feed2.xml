                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even with its US future <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/why-dji-drones-might-be-banned-in-the-us-170030273.html">in limbo</a>, DJI keeps releasing impressive drones. Its latest is the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-neo-2-selfie-drone-has-lidar-for-obstacle-avoidance-174700215.html">Neo 2</a>, an inexpensive, lightweight model aimed at creators and hobbyists. It’s an upgraded version of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-review-the-best-200-drone-ever-made-010032884.html">the Neo</a>, an immensely popular drone both in the US and elsewhere. The new model is equally safe and easy to fly thanks to the shrouded props, palm takeoff and voice control.</p> 
<p>DJI didn’t just tack on a number and call it a day, though. The Neo 2 is loaded with new features like LiDAR obstacle detection, improved video quality and longer battery life — all at only a slightly higher price. In fact, a couple of the new features can’t even be found on high-end DJI drones.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="1b520a8b7aad433181a5836a1b3e4504" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://store.dji.com/selection/camera-drones"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>The original Neo wasn’t perfect; the propellers on that model emitted a banshee-like scream. The lack of obstacle detection and short battery life also wasn’t ideal. Has the company solved these problems on the new model? Mostly, yes — and it’s now a nearly perfect personal drone.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-design">Design</h2> 
<p>Though the Neo 2 has the same 6.5-inch square size and friendly appearance as before, there are some important differences. A new LiDAR sensor beside the camera is designed to detect forward obstacles, and is a surprising inclusion for such an affordable drone. On the left front is a small display — a first for a DJI drone — that shows the current shot mode (follow, dronie, etc.).</p> 
<p>The gimbal has also been upgraded and can now rotate instead of just tilt. That means the camera will stay level when the drone banks, with no ugly cropping or reduced resolution that I occasionally saw when doing extreme maneuvers with the Neo.</p> 
<div id="f040fd9c8f5d4c37ad8b19badb6569e1">

</div> 
<p>The Neo 2 has three buttons on the side (rather than just one on top as before), along with two new omnidirectional sensors. On top of helping the Neo 2 avoid obstacles, these improve stability in featureless or non-GPS environments like indoors and over water.</p> 
<p>Finally, if you buy a Neo 2 with the optional RC-2 or RC-N3 controller, it includes a removable Digital Transceiver with a pair of antennae. Those components give it a butterfly-like appearance and could affect long term durability. However, making them an add-on gave DJI a way to make the basic (non-controller) version as inexpensive as possible.</p> 
<p>With all those changes, the Neo 2 is a bit heavier at 5.6 ounces (160 grams) with the Digital Transceiver, compared to 4.8 ounces (135 grams) for the Neo. That’s still easily small enough to slide in a bag and light enough (under 250 grams) that you won’t need to register your drone with the authorities.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-features">Features</h2> 
<p>Gesture control is a major new Neo 2 feature not found on other DJI drones. It lets you fly with surprising precision, if you don’t mind looking a little silly. To do so, wave a hand up, down or sideways to climb and bank, move two hands apart or together to make it approach or move away (think pinch-to-zoom in the air), clench a fist to stop it and hold out your palm to land. Gestures can be used in combination with other fly modes so you get the exact shot you want.</p>

<p>Along with the ability to wave your hands, the Neo 2 offers other ways to fly like palm takeoff. After selecting the flight mode (shown on the new display and audibly announced), you can launch the Neo 2 from your hand by pressing the takeoff button or using voice control. It will then execute the chosen mode, fly back to you and land on your outstretched palm.</p> 
<p>Smartphone control (not seen on other DJI drones) is available for manual flight. Wi-Fi range has been extended by ten times to 546 yards, compared to 55 yards for the Neo. However, for that range you need a clear signal path with no obstacles between you and the drone. For more precise flight and longer range (up to 6 miles), the Neo 2 supports RC-N2, RC-N3 or RC-2 controllers. And FPV (first person) flying is still an option when using <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-goggles-n3-for-fpv-drones-improve-comfort-and-allow-eyeglasses-130012665.html">DJI’s Goggles N3</a> or Goggles 3, paired with the RC Motion 3 or FPV Remote Controller 3.</p> 
<p>The Neo 3’s Quickshots repertoire has also been updated. A fun new mode is the “<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.videomaker.com/how-to/shooting/composition/the-hitchcock-zoom-its-history-and-how-to-achieve-it/">Hitchcock zoom</a>.” When activated, the drone backs away while zooming in at the same time, creating a trippy perspective effect you might’ve seen in <em>Vertigo</em> and <em>Jaws</em>. Again, this feature is unique to the Neo 2 in DJI’s lineup.</p> 
<p>Other key functions include compatibility with DJI’s microphones, including the Mic 2, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-much-smaller-mic-3-can-record-four-subjects-at-once-120032192.html">Mic 3</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-tiny-mic-mini-offers-high-quality-wireless-sound-recording-starting-at-89-130036583.html">Mic Mini</a>. Since the Neo 2 is quieter than the Neo (more on that shortly), noise cancelling requirements are reduced so audio quality is improved. Onboard storage has also been upgraded to 49GB (up from 22GB), letting you record up to 175 minutes of 4K video. At the same time, DJI more than doubled the Wi-Fi transfer speed to 80MB/s.</p>

<p>The Neo 2 retains the Neo’s toughness and protection, but it can now fly around obstacles instead of just plowing through them thanks to the LiDAR and sensors. To test that, I used it to follow subjects around trees, buildings and other obstacles. The aim was to see not only how well it avoided crashes in all directions, but to observe how smoothly it tracked while doing so.</p> 
<p>To start, I engaged the ActiveTrack follow feature and used the Trace mode “steering wheel’ to follow subjects from the front, sides and back. When flying forward, the Neo 2 avoided most obstacles using its LiDAR, while swooping cinematically around trees and branches. It occasionally failed to detect small twigs and leaves, but unlike <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6Ed88dWDlE">open-prop DJI drones</a>, it usually flew through them without incident. With just two omni sensors, the Neo 2 is less adept at avoiding obstacles to the sides and rear, however. So if you’re using it to vlog while walking or biking, it’s best to make sure there’s nothing in the way.</p> 
<p>With a top speed of just 18 mph, the original Neo was so slow that it could barely track a bike. Luckily, the Neo 2 is much faster with speeds up to 27 mph in follow mode and even has a special “Bicycle Tracking” mode. I tested that on an e-bike and the drone easily kept up with me while easily avoiding obstacles in the forward direction. Again, you need to be extra careful when it’s flying backwards or sideways.</p> 
<p>The Neo 2 is as agile as ever, so the extra velocity makes it a better FPV drone as well. While wearing the Goggles N3, I was able to enjoy that sensation of extra speed as it swooped around obstacles. That, plus the low price, makes it a good first drone for anyone looking to get into FPV flying.</p> 
<p>I likened the Neo’s prop noise to a banshee howl, but the Neo 2 is maybe a… banshee purr. Both the decibel level and pitch are now tolerable, even indoors. I flew it around at a fairly loud party and hardly anyone noticed; it also didn’t draw much attention in a public park. The only negative is it’s a high-pitched sound, a noise that carries even across high altitudes.</p>

<p>With a new 12MP, 1/2-inch sensor camera, video quality is excellent for this price range. The Neo 2 now supports 4K at up to 60 fps or 100 fps in slo-mo mode. On the previous model, it was just 30 fps. The Neo 2 also has an f/2.0 iris to let in more light compared to the previous f/2.8. With those updates, the drone offers sharper and more color-accurate video and photos than the Neo.</p> 
<p>There are of course some sacrifices at this price. The small sensor means the Neo 2 has mediocre low-light capability, with pronounced grain at the maximum ISO 12,800 rating that’s even noticeable at ISO 3,200. Unlike the $400 Flip, the Neo 2 has no 10-bit D-LogM capability, so over- or underexposed video is hard to correct.</p> 
<p>With those issues, video and photos from the Neo 2 aren&#39;t quite good enough for professional work. However, it’s excellent for social media users, hobbyists and content creators, delivering smartphone-quality aerial shots.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>DJI has yet to reveal availability or pricing of the Neo 2 in the US (or whether it will come here at all) due to a looming December 23 ban. If it does arrive, it will effectively have no competition at its price point, which I expect to be around $250. The HoverAir X1 is the only name brand alternative, but costs twice as much. That model offers solid follow-me capabilities for activities like biking and hiking. Feature-wise, though, it pales in comparison to the Neo 2, with inferior video quality, battery life, range and obstacle detection.</p> 
<p>DJI’s Neo 2 is not just the best personal drone; it&#39;s the best tech product I’ve seen in a while, period. It retains everything I liked about the Neo, especially the ease of use and safety features. On top of that, it adds a host of useful functions like obstacle protection and, thank goodness, lower noise levels. With all that, the Neo 2 performs that rare trick of doing much more than I expected — for a lot less money.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-2-review-the-best-budget-drone-is-now-even-better-120026045.html?src=rss]]></description>

We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.</p> 
<p>Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h2 id="jump-link-best-streaming-deals">Best streaming deals</h2> 
<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> 
<p>If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate.</p>

Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don&#39;t want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-streaming-bundle-discounts">Streaming bundle discounts</h2> 
<p>There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> 
<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-disney">Disney+</h3> 
<p>If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0">who Pepe Silvia is</a> when you look at <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart</a>, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing.</p>

What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address.</p>

<p>For the most part, the features you want from a set of “Android earbuds” are the same as what you want from any headphones. Great sound quality, a comfortable fit and sufficient battery life are still the foundations. Adequate water resistance is good for workouts, and nobody wants a crummy mic for making calls. Once you approach the $100 range, features like active noise cancellation (ANC), wireless charging, an ambient sound mode (which lets you better hear outside noise without turning off your music) and multipoint connectivity (the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously) should be expected.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>For Android devices specifically, there are a few extras to consider. A dedicated app that makes it easy to switch sound modes, customize the audio profile, locate your earbuds if they ever get misplaced or adjust other settings is strongly preferred. Features like <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/what-is-google-fast-pair/">Google Fast Pair</a> or NFC-based pairing, which can help you avoid having to dig through your Bluetooth menu to connect your earbuds for the first time, are also nice perks. Some Android devices can also utilize higher-quality <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/from-mono-to-mainstream-20-years-of-bluetooth-audio-153031600.html">Bluetooth codecs</a> such as <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.aptx.com/aptx-adaptive">aptX Adaptive</a> or Sony’s <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/">LDAC</a> — these aren’t nearly as important to audio quality as the actual architecture of your earbuds, but they can help wring out a little more detail if the buds are capable enough and you’re streaming lossless files. AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming.</p> 
<p>Diversity is Android’s greatest strength, but it also means that some wireless earbuds play nicer with certain devices, typically those made by the same company. Recent Samsung earbuds, for instance, come with a few perks that are only available if you use a Galaxy phone. We have a couple of recommendations related to this idea above.</p>

<p>The best way to test earphones is simply to wear them as much as possible, so that’s what we do. We typically do this over a one- to two-week period, though embargo times occasionally force us to finish our review process a bit faster. We listen to a test playlist that includes several musical genres and podcasts, paying close attention to how each pair approaches the bass, mid and treble frequencies to get an accurate sense of its sound profile. We also test at high and low volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. We do not have access to a <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.grasacoustics.com/products/head-torso-simulators-kemar">dummy head</a> to take more objective measurements, but we’ll sometimes look to sites like <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones"><em>Rtings</em></a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.soundguys.com/"><em>SoundGuys</em></a> and others that do just to ensure our impressions are not wildly off-base. If a model supports custom EQ, we’ll tinker with that and use the available EQ presets to see if one sounds dramatically better than the others — though in general we base most of our impressions on the stock tuning each pair uses by default.</p> 
<p>To assess microphone quality, we record our own audio samples and take multiple calls with a partner both indoors and outside. For battery life, we play our test playlist on a loop with the volume around 75 percent and measure how long it takes for each set to drain. Where applicable, we do a thorough review of a pair’s companion app and test each available feature. While comfort is ultimately subjective, we take note of how secure each pair feels while we’re on the move. We also use certain pairs in especially crowded public spaces to get a better sense of their passive and active noise cancellation, as well as their ability to maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-recent-updates">Recent updates</h2> 
<p><strong>November 2025</strong>: The lightly updated Beats Powerbeats Fit replace the older Beats Fit Pro as our top pick for working out. We’ve also noted the new Google Pixel Buds 2a as a cheaper alternative to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which remain our recommendation for Pixel phone users.</p> 
<p><strong>August 2025</strong>: We’ve taken another sweep to ensure our advice is still up-to-date.</p> 
<p><strong>May 2025</strong>: We’ve checked this guide to ensure our top picks still stand and noted a couple alternatives to the Noble Fokus Rex5, since that pair has had stock issues of late. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tariffs/">tariff policy</a> affects the pricing and stock of our recommendations (and the consumer tech industry as a whole). All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.</p> 
<p><strong>February 2025</strong>: The Noble FoKus Rex5 is our new &quot;best for sound quality&quot; pick, replacing the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4. Our other recommendations remain unchanged.</p> 
<p><strong>December 2024</strong>: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and ensured that our current picks are still accurate.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-earbuds-for-android-devices-120015765.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, the best features in a new operating system aren&#39;t the flashy ones that get broadcast during a keynote. They&#39;re subtle improvements that naturally fit into how you use your device and just make the experience better. One of those appears to be coming in the next macOS update. The dev beta of Tahoe 26.2 includes a feature that essentially lets your computer screen function as a ring light during a video call.</p><p>It&#39;s called Edge Light and it illuminates a rectangular band around the edge of the screen. Apple&#39;s Neural Engine will also position the light based on where it detects your face in the video frame. There are some controls for making the light warmer or cooler, and it can be set to turn on automatically once the brightness in your environment dims. Edge Light doesn&#39;t cover the top menu bar, and it will also move out of the way if the cursor hovers over it so that you can still use your laptop normally while on a call.&nbsp;</p><p>Edge Light will only be available on MacBooks from after 2024 that are running on Apple&#39;s Silicon. It may not be a true replacement for a ring light, but it&#39;s probably a step up from opening a bunch of blank Google Docs to try and illuminate yourself for a last-minute meeting.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-next-macos-update-can-turn-your-screen-into-a-ring-light-234410504.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IBM <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-12-ibm-delivers-new-quantum-processors,-software,-and-algorithm-breakthroughs-on-path-to-advantage-and-fault-tolerance" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">has introduced</a> two different quantum chips that it believes could help demonstrate &quot;quantum advantage,&quot; or the ability for a quantum computer to solve a problem faster than a classical computer, by the end of 2026. The new chips, Nighthawk and Loon, should help do that by taking different approaches to connecting qubits in a quantum computer, producing fewer errors and supporting more complex computations.</p><p>Of the two new chips, IBM Quantum Nighthawk is the one the company believes it can iterate on to produce quantum advantage. By the end of 2025, the version of Nighthawk IBM will provide to its partners will have &quot;120 qubits linked together with 218 next-generation tunable couplers&quot; arranged in a square lattice to connect with their neighbors. IBM claims this will allow Nighthawk to &quot;execute circuits with 30 percent more complexity&quot; while maintaining lower error rates. It&#39;ll also let it handle more demanding computational problems &quot;that require up to 5,000 two-qubit gates,&quot; the company says. </p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IBM-Quantum-Loon.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IBM-Quantum-Loon.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A silver, rectangular Quantum Loon chip." data-uuid="58dde12b-d79a-4072-b79c-5bba550d0d04"><figcaption>The IBM Quantum Loon chip.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IBM</div></figure><p>IBM Quantum Loon is the more experimental of the two chips, connecting qubits not just horizontally on the chip, but vertically, too, <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1fa16fbb-59f6-4e22-9ee4-e51608b12319&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=a3b14338-bad2-4f1a-b168-6bc30e078b1f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=New+Scientist&amp;linkText=New+Scientist+writes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2llbnRpc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjUwMzc5OS1pYm0taGFzLXVudmVpbGVkLXR3by11bnByZWNlZGVudGVkbHktY29tcGxleC1xdWFudHVtLWNvbXB1dGVycy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEzYjE0MzM4LWJhZDItNGYxYS1iMTY4LTZiYzMwZTA3OGIxZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2NpZW50aXN0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzI1MDM3OTktaWJtLWhhcy11bnZlaWxlZC10d28tdW5wcmVjZWRlbnRlZGx5LWNvbXBsZXgtcXVhbnR1bS1jb21wdXRlcnMvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQEEfjHkZh7y_BGaYBQtmVpEO7NKhvRmNJW04UPnNRSj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscientist.com%2Farticle%2F2503799-ibm-has-unveiled-two-unprecedentedly-complex-quantum-computers%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:New Scientist;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2503799-ibm-has-unveiled-two-unprecedentedly-complex-quantum-computers/"><em>New Scientist</em> writes</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monarch Money is one of our favorite budgeting apps and, fittingly enough, there&#39;s a way for newcomers to save money on a subscription right now. If you use the code <strong>MONARCHVIP </strong>at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Monarch Money;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=you+can+get+12+months+of+access+for+%2450+with+this+code.&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code.</a></p> 
<p>There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can&#39;t be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can&#39;t redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html">offers a great deal of customization and granularity</a>, which outweighs our misgivings.</p> 
<p>On the main dashboard, you&#39;ll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you&#39;ve set. There&#39;s also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what&#39;s been happening with your money that month. You&#39;ll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.</p> 
<p>Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it&#39;s a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.</p> 
<p>If you&#39;re a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven&#39;t yet found a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html">Mint replacement</a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is coming to Switch and Switch 2 consoles on December 16. The game was in early access for around a year before being officially released for PC and consoles <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-officially-out-for-pc-and-consoles-184621675.html"><ins>back in August</ins></a>.</p>
<p>This version has been &quot;optimized for handheld and hybrid play&quot; and includes all content from the original release. That means players will be able access a wide variety of biomes, weapons and secrets.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ac114f0968174e0bb866efc2a1d07070"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOlvnXnuLPE?si=K_RKzPUNV4oKJQl3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>This is a unique take on the Prince of Persia franchise, bringing parkour-style movement and combat to the roguelike genre. It&#39;s a fun and frenetic experience that calls to mind another sidescrolling roguelike, <em>Dead Cells</em>. This game was actually co-developed by Evil Empire, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-13-motion-twin-dead-cells-nintendo-switch-irl.html"><ins>the company behind </ins><em><ins>Dead Cells</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>This is a digital release, but collectors have something to look forward to. <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is getting a deluxe physical release on April 10 for Switch, Switch 2 and PS5.</p>
<p>This physical version ships with a game key card, a double-sided poster and a set of cards depicting scenes from the game. When flipped, the cards join together to make up a portion of the title&#39;s world map. Incidentally, there&#39;s no physical version coming for Xbox Series X/S, despite already being available to download.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-hits-switch-and-switch-2-on-december-16-194828522.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-pacific-drive-still-wakes-the-deep-and-more/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">revealed</a> the list of November additions to its PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for those on the Extra and Premium tiers of the subscription service. It’s a pretty darn good slate of games this time around, headlined by the return of the PS4 and PS5 versions of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> to the service. </p><p>It’s at least the third time <em>GTA V </em>has been part of the Game Catalog — it was <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-november-include-gta-v-again-and-dying-light-2-174646227.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in the lineup twice last year</a>. Developer Rockstar Games, which is currently <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/union-files-legal-claims-against-rockstar-games-following-alleged-union-busting-165033747.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">facing accusations of union busting,</a> is set to release <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">in November 2026</a>. If you have yet to play <em>GTA V </em>or haven’t dipped in since the PS3/Xbox 360 era, this could be a decent way for you to pass some time until the next entry arrives.</p><p><em>Pacific Drive </em>(PS5) joined the Game Pass library when it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/superhero-workplace-comedy-more-powerwashing-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-230000337.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">hit Xbox last month</a> and it’s headed to Sony’s subscription service as well. This is a nifty looking run-based survival game that sees you driving around a post-apocalyptic version of the Pacific Northwest in search of parts to upgrade your station wagon. </p><p><em>Still Wakes the Deep </em>(PS5), a narrative horror game from <em>Dear Esther </em>studio The Chinese Room, is also coming to the PS Plus catalog this month. It pits you against terrifying creatures while you’re trapped on an oil rig in the North Sea. Engadget senior editor Jessica Conditt called this one <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/still-wakes-the-deep-is-a-modern-horror-classic-175304800.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">a “modern horror classic.”</a></p><p>The tremendously silly and rude <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/thank-goodness-youre-here-is-a-vibrant-funny-unashamedly-silly-game-133030648.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></a>, tactical multiplayer shooter <em>Insurgency: Sandstorm </em>and racing games <em>Monster Jam Showdown </em>and <em>MotoGP 25 </em>will be available to PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers on both PS4 and PS5 later this month. First-person puzzle game <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-talos-principle-2-is-the-ideal-blend-of-puzzle-and-story-150009663.html" data-i13n="slk:The Talos Principle II;cpos:8;pos:1"><em>The Talos Principle II</em></a><em> </em>will only be on PS5. </p><p>PS Plus Premium members get one extra game this month. An emulated version of PS2 game <em>Tomb Raider: Anniversary </em>will be playable on PS4 and PS5 for the first time.</p><p>All of these will join the PS Plus Game Catalog on November 18. In the meantime, all PS Plus members can claim the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/stray-leads-novembers-lineup-of-ps-plus-games-180339318.html" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1">monthly games for November</a>, which are <em>Stray, EA Sports WRC 24 </em>and <em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</em>. You have until December 1 to add those to your <s>backlog</s> library.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-november-include-gta-5-pacific-drive-and-still-wakes-the-deep-194029093.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve is making another run at offering <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-04-valve-steam-machine-hands-on.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">a console-style experience</a> in your living room. The company has announced a new <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Steam Machine</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Steam Controller</a> that let you play PC games on your TV in the same way the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">Steam Deck</a> lets you play them on the go. Better yet, it’s planning to release them both in early 2026.</p><p>The Steam Machine works like a console, but is technically a compact PC running Linux-based SteamOS. The boxy device features a customizable front plate and LED light strip, with a USB-A port and a microSD card slot available up front, and DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0 and ethernet ports on the back. Inside, the Steam Machine is powered by what Valve describes as a “semi-custom AMD Zen 4” CPU and a “semi-Custom AMD RDNA3 ” GPU with “16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM” and either 512GB or 2TB of SSD storage.</p><p>Valve says the Steam Machine has “roughly six times the horsepower” of the Steam Deck, and is capable of supporting 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR. Interestingly, Valve is also pitching the device as a way to stream more demanding games to your Steam Deck, the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Steam Frame</a> VR headset the company also announced today or any device running Steam Link.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Valve-Steam-Controller.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Valve-Steam-Controller.jpg" style="height:4320px;width:7680px;" alt="Someone holding the new Steam Controller, with trackpads visible." data-uuid="6da78a6d-868b-49a1-9c5e-9b3c2bdf7b11"><figcaption>Someone holding the new Steam Controller, with trackpads visible.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>While you could use the Steam Machine with a traditional Bluetooth controller, Valve has created its own solution. The new Steam Controller puts all of the various control methods of the Steam Deck into a wireless controller. That includes sticks, face buttons, grip buttons, triggers and bumpers, but also trackpads for mouse controls and gyro controls, too. The Steam Controller works over both Bluetooth or a wired connection, and Valve is also including a charging dongle that doubles as a wireless transmitter for the fastest possible connection.</p><p>Like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-10-we-hate-valve-steam-controller-because-its-different.html" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1">original Steam Controller</a>, your input method can be individually customized for each game, and profiles can be shared. Valve also says the new controller will work with any device that runs Steam, including the Steam Deck, Steam Machine and Steam Frame.<br><br>Missing from Valve’s announcement is any kind of official price. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">Early hands-ons</a> with both the Steam Machine and Steam Controller suggest Valve wants the devices to be competitively priced with equivalent PCs and game controllers. Given the extra power and features, though, it seems like they might not be as much of a deal as the $400 Steam Deck was at launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="b9dddc3709144c1c99c6b58d001cab88"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Valve made a triumphant return to the hardware market with the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719-180026139.html">Steam Deck</a> and its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">OLED-toting</a> counterpart, and now it’s having another crack at virtual reality with the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame</a>. The Steam Frame is the long-rumored headset from Valve that had <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-standalone-vr-headset-report-120909267.html">previously</a> been codenamed &quot;Deckard.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html">also announced</a> a new Steam controller and PC called the Steam Machine. All three devices are coming in early 2026. Valve is holding off on announcing pricing and exact availability of the new hardware. There are Steam Frame dev kits available for developers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Valve says the Steam Frame is a wireless, &quot;streaming-first&quot; headset and you can hop into your games as soon as you pop it on. It supports both VR and flatscreen games. The company made a plug-and-play 6GHz wireless adapter that you slot into your PC (or Steam Machine). It has a dual-radio setup to help minimize interference, with one radio dedicated to streaming audio and visuals to the headset, and the other for Wi-Fi.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-a-standalone-vr-headset">A standalone VR headset</h2>
<p>But you don&#39;t need a PC to play games on the Steam Frame. As with Meta Quest headsets, it can run games as a standalone device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The headset has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of built-in UFS storage. There&#39;s a microSD card slot, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3. Of course, the headset is powered by SteamOS. As with the Steam Deck and Steam Machine, there&#39;ll be a Steam Frame verified program, so you can see at a glance which games will run on the Steam Frame in standalone mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, the Steam Frame <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">will support Android games</a>. It seems Valve is hoping that developers who made games and VR experiences for Android-based headsets (such as the Meta Quest lineup) will bring them to Steam.</p>
<p>The Steam Frame runs on a rechargeable 21.6Wh Li-ion battery. There&#39;s one USB-C 2.0 port at the back that you&#39;ll use for both charging and data transfers. You can recharge the battery at a rate of up to 45W. It&#39;s unclear how long the Steam Frame&#39;s battery will run on a charge.</p>
<p>The battery is positioned on the rear of the headstrap. So you won&#39;t necessarily need to have an external battery pack that&#39;s attached to the system by an annoying cable. It&#39;ll be possible to swap the standard headstrap (into which the audio drivers are integrated) for a different option, perhaps one with a larger battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the battery built into the headstrap, Valve says the Steam Frame weighs just under a pound at 440 grams. The core module — the front part — is 185 grams (6.5oz) and the headstrap weighs 245 grams (8.6 ounces).</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-image-optimization-tech">Image optimization tech</h2>
<p>The Steam Frame has an optimization feature called Foveated Streaming. Valve says this uses low-latency eye-tracking (powered by two internal cameras) to optimize the detail in the image wherever your eyes are looking. The company claims it can offer a &quot;10x improvement in image quality and effective bandwidth.&quot; Foveated Streaming is said to work for every game in your Steam library.</p>
<p>The headset has dual 2160 x 2160 LCD panels with refresh rates of up to 144Hz, a field of view of up to 110 degrees and an IPD target range of 60mm to 70mm. Valve added that &quot;thin and light custom pancake lenses provide edge-to-edge sharpness and a large eye box.&quot; The company says the maximum width for eye glasses is 140mm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for audio, the Steam Frame has dual stereo speakers on each side with support for high-fidelity audio. Valve says the speakers on each side are &quot;oriented in opposite directions to cancel out vibrations,&quot; which can impact the tracking system.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the headset has four high-res monochrome cameras for controller and headset tracking — the Steam Frame uses inside-out tracking. Valve says there are infrared LEDs on the outside of the device that can help support tracking in dark environments. There&#39;s monochrome passthrough support too.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-steam-frame-controllers">Steam Frame controllers</h2>
<p>Naturally, you&#39;ll need a way to play all of the games, so the headset comes with a pair of Steam Frame controllers. The headset tracks the positions of the controllers for VR games, with full 6-DOF tracking and IMU support. They have a split gamepad format with a D-pad, thumbsticks, ABXY buttons, triggers and bumpers. They&#39;re designed to work with your entire Steam library, and they certainly look a bit more intuitive than the PlayStation VR2 controllers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than going down the Hall effect route, Valve opted for magnetic thumbsticks, which support capacitive finger tracking. Each controller is said to run for around 40 hours before you&#39;ll have to swap out the AA battery that powers it. If you&#39;d rather play games on the Steam Frame with the new Steam Controller, you&#39;ll absolutely be able to do that.</p>
<p>The Steam Frame is far from Valve&#39;s first VR headset. It released the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index</a> in 2019, and previously worked with HTC on its <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685-133000767.html">Vive</a> headsets, which were initially consumer VR products before HTC shifted its focus to business and enterprise.</p>
<p>While none of Valve’s previous PC-focused headsets had the mainstream impact of Meta’s <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html">Quest</a> lineup or arguably even <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html">PlayStation VR</a> (which by all accounts <em>is</em> still an active platform, not that Sony’s release calendar backs it up), the company is responsible for what is probably the medium’s greatest-ever game in <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>. And with SteamOS on the Steam Deck being such a hit that other companies are practically begging Valve to let them put it in their <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steamos-now-officially-supports-a-second-handheld-221702983.html">own rival handhelds</a>, it’s easy to imagine the Steam Frame becoming a serious rival to the Meta Quest.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple Arcade has a fairly stacked winter, as the platform is adding some standout titles on December 4. Arcade titles are playable on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>First up, there&#39;s<em> Cult of the Lamb Arcade Edition</em>. This is a port of the incredibly addictive <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-devolver-release-date-223042486.html">roguelike/town sim hybrid thingamajig</a>, with some new features exclusive to Arcade subscribers. This version includes new follower forms, decorations and outfits. It also includes all existing content updates, though Apple hasn&#39;t announced if it would be getting <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cult-of-the-lambs-next-dlc-is-woolhaven-out-in-early-2026-225129643.html">forthcoming content updates</a>.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> is two games in one. There&#39;s a top-down action component and a base builder, with each mechanic interacting in unique and often hilarious ways. Yes, you can feed your cult members poop, if that&#39;s your bag.</p>

<p>The iconic <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> also releases for Apple Arcade next month. This game seems like a great fit for Apple&#39;s service, given the zen-like mechanic of washing down grime. The sequel <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/powerwash-simulator-2-arrives-on-october-23-154854867.html">came out last month</a> for other platforms. If you&#39;re a clean freak, this is the game for you.</p>
<p>Apple is dropping a sequel to <em>SpongeBob Patty Pursuit</em>. The Arcade original <em>SpongeBob Patty Pursuit 2</em> casts players as both the titular SpongeBob and Plankton in a sidescrolling adventure. The first one was fairly well-reviewed.</p>

<p><em>Subway Surfers+</em> and <em>Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm+</em> will also be available on December 4. Finally, a new Apple Vision Pro game is coming to Arcade this week. <em>Glassbreakers: Champions of Moss </em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5a87ff41-1235-445d-b000-49881a9f6170&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=will+be+available+on+the+platform&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nbGFzc2JyZWFrZXJzL2lkNjU5Njc4MDUyMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWE4N2ZmNDEtMTIzNS00NDVkLWIwMDAtNDk4ODFhOWY2MTcwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nbGFzc2JyZWFrZXJzL2lkNjU5Njc4MDUyMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWGrbaq_v4qco13HHJwUBueKj8TYQ7U-klRn5oQhVVD6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fglassbreakers%2Fid6596780523" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glassbreakers/id6596780523">will be available on the platform</a> from November 13.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html">virtual private network (VPN)</a> is useful in several ways — a good one can stream foreign TV shows and events, protect your information from cybercrime and thwart those online trackers that show you creepily invasive ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay.</p>
<p>Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. VPN providers want to boost their subscriber numbers, so they give out steep discounts to customers who sign up for a year or more at once. This is a win for you as well — while you pay out more upfront, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-what-makes-a-good-vpn-deal"><strong>What makes a good VPN deal</strong></h2>
<p>Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ProtonVPN;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06a20697-4135-4e83-a421-f326eee937ed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3820f07f-0c5e-4a96-baba-d6d9ea0510c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ProtonVPN&amp;linkText=Proton+VPN%27s+coupon+for+Engadget+readers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzgyMGYwN2YtMGM1ZS00YTk2LWJhYmEtZDZkOWVhMDUxMGMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3RvbnZwbi5jb20vbC92cG4taG9tZS1wbGFucy1vZmZlci02NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXblbAdg41Upy-ikI1NWGnvIj4qyrHoZiRe-XQqP16_n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fl%2Fvpn-home-plans-offer-66" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer-66">Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers</a>.</p>
<p>One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.</p>

<p>In other words, folks with a passport who have yet to upgrade a driver&#39;s license to a Real ID will be able to board a plane without bringing a physical copy of that passport to the airport. This whole Real ID thing <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/real-id-deadline-delay-2025-224526308.html"><ins>has been a source of frustration</ins></a> to many, so I appreciate any effort to make traveling a bit easier.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This ID will be visible on both iPhones and the Apple Watch and Apple says the service is being implemented at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 US-based airports. It&#39;s only used for ID on domestic flights; if you&#39;re planning to travel internationally you&#39;ll still need a physical passport.</p>
<p>Also, not all TSA readers have been implemented with the technology to scan these digital IDs just yet, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/apple-launches-digital-id-a-way-to-carry-your-passport-on-your-phone-for-use-at-tsa-checkpoints/"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. You might want to bring along a paper passport for the time being to let the TSA and Apple get their ducks in a row.</p>

<p>The company has plans to expand this feature beyond air travel. Apple says businesses will eventually be able to accept these IDs for the purposes of age verification. This Digital ID feature <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-wallets-ios-26-update-scans-your-emails-for-package-delivery-tracking-123054484.html"><ins>was first announced as part of iOS 26</ins></a> and also adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet.</p>

<p>Adding a passport seems simple enough. Just head to the Wallet app and follow the prompts. Users will have to pose for a selfie and complete a series of facial and head movements for security.</p>
<p>The wallet platform also accepts driver&#39;s licences and state IDs, but only in 12 states and Puerto Rico. These won&#39;t be valid for flying, however, as neither is a Real ID or passport.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-introduces-a-new-digital-id-feature-to-make-boarding-flights-easier-175130213.html?src=rss]]></description>

As it turns out, there is a new Ratchet &amp; Clank game coming soon, just not on PS5.</p><p><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em> is a “fast-paced” multiplayer arena shooter that’s coming to iOS and Android soon. In fact, according to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">the game’s website</a>, it’s already available in select countries. Folks in other locales who are interested can pre-register.</p><p>Mobile developer Oh BiBi took the reins from Insomniac for this one. There are still platforming elements in <em>Ranger Rumble. </em>It looks quite colorful and you’ll have a variety of weapons, abilities and characters at your disposal. There are several game modes, including a soccer-style one. <em>Ranger Rumble</em> is free-to-play, though it will likely have microtransactions. For what it’s worth, you’ll be able to customize your characters.  </p><p>This isn’t the first time that the Ratchet &amp; Clank series has made its way to mobile. <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Mobile</em> debuted in 2005, before the arrival of iPhone and Android devices. Endless runner <em>Before the Nexus </em><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-20-ratchet-and-clank-before-the-nexus-companion-game-out-now-on-ios.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">arrived eight years later</a>. </p><p>A sequel to <em>Going Mobile </em>called <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Clone Home </em>was originally slated to hit Java phones in 2006 before it was canceled. However, dedicated fans found a phone that had a copy of the game on it, then cracked the device’s encryption and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-long-lost-ratchet-and-clank-mobile-game-has-been-found-123008739.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">last month made <em>Clone Home </em>available for anyone to download.</a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/a-ratchet-and-clank-multiplayer-game-is-coming-to-ios-and-android-soon-172634125.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waymo is bringing its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://waymo.com/blog/2025/11/taking-riders-further-safely-with-freeways"><ins>driverless cars to freeways</ins></a> in three major US cities and the surrounding environs. These areas include San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The platform didn&#39;t say how many of these vehicles have been greenlit to take to the freeway, other than noting that &quot;a growing number of public riders&quot; will be given access. At the very least, families will be able to play a new road trip game in which they point out cars with weird spinning LiDAR units on the roof.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Google-owned ridesharing company says that these freeway rides can be used for daily commutes, traveling to various airports or just joyriding from, say, downtown LA to Culver City. The San Francisco service area is particularly large, stretching across the entire peninsula. The newly-expanded service goes all the way down to San Jose, including the San Jose Mineta International Airport.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning of this freeway expansion, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-issues-recall-after-one-its-self-driving-taxis-crashed-into-a-pole-121937607.html"><ins>assuming everything goes well</ins></a> in these early phases. To that end, the platform says its vehicles have already logged &quot;millions of miles&quot; on freeways and that they are adept at &quot;skillfully handling highway dynamics.&quot;</p>
<p>Waymo notes that it&#39;s planning something similar for Austin, Atlanta and other unannounced regions.

<p>Admittedly, we have seen this model cheaper before, but if you’re on cooking duty for Thanksgiving, you might not have the option of waiting until what <em>could</em> be a deeper discount on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-tech-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-anker-and-others-100052831.html"><ins>Black Friday</ins></a>. And the DZ401 is the perfect air fryer for the holiday season, owing to its trademark dual baskets, which allow you to cook up two completely different foods simultaneously. It takes up a fair amount of space, but it’s worth it if you have a lot of hungry mouths to feed.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>This 10-quart fryer includes a smart cook thermometer and six cooking modes, including air broil, roast and dehydrate alongside the default air fry mode. The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert.</p> 
<p>The Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html"><ins>buying guide</ins></a> for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Backbone just released a new Pro version of its Xbox controller. The Backbone Pro Xbox Edition looks like an improvement over the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-backbone-one-xbox-edition-controller-is-a-great-way-to-work-through-that-game-pass-library-130031268.html">pre-existing One controller</a> in nearly every way.</p>
<p>It&#39;s still a USB-C shell that wraps around a phone or related device, but the actual controller is now more in league with an actual Xbox gamepad. It features full-size control sticks, hall effect triggers and two customizable back buttons. Most of the inputs can be remapped. This should make plowing through that Game Pass library an absolute breeze.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To that end, this controller has Bluetooth. This means you won&#39;t have to rely on a smartphone or whatever device can physically attach to the gamepad. Game Pass has become available on all kinds of platforms in recent years, from PCs and smart TVs to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-is-out-now-and-it-costs-400-134358869.html">Meta Quest VR headsets</a>. This opens up all of that. The company promises a simplified &quot;tap and play&quot; experience.</p>

<p>This Bluetooth mode does offer 40 hours of battery life per charge. The smartphone powers it when using it in a wired configuration, so it&#39;ll last as long as the phone does. The controllers pair with a proprietary app that allows for the aforementioned remapping and other customization options.</p>
<p>The controller is available right now at brick and mortar locations like Best Buy and digital storefronts such as Amazon. It costs $180 and ships with a free month of Game Pass Ultimate. The only potential downside here is Game Pass itself. The price <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html">keeps going up</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/backbone-launches-pro-xbox-edition-controller-with-bluetooth-and-an-updated-design-170018809.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) has issued formal legal claims against Rockstar Games, which it has accused of union busting. The <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> developer last month <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rockstar-games-accused-of-union-busting-in-the-uk-221004334.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">fired dozens of employees who were organizing</a>.</p><p>The IWGB <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">said in a statement</a> it made several attempts to meet with Rockstar with the aim of resolving the situation through negotiations, but claimed the studio rebuffed the union. It’s now looking to take the matter before a court. “We have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the claimants,” the IWGB said. It added that it believed the firings “amount to victimization and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity.” The union previously said that all of those who Rockstar fired were members of the members of an IWGB Game Workers Union Discord server.</p><p>Alex Marshall, the president of IWGB pledged that the union will “mount a full legal defense with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers. Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.” Marshall added that the union will “not be intimidated.”</p><p>Rockstar claimed that it fired the more than 30 workers in question for “gross misconduct, and for no other reason” and it <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/iwgb-accuses-rockstar-of-union-busting-following-reported-dismissal-of-over-30-employees" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">accused them</a> of “distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.”  Engadget has asked the company, which last week <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">delayed <em>GTA VI </em>by a further six months</a>, to comment on IWGB issuing legal claims against it.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>People Make Games</em></a> reported this week that a collective of workers called the Rockstar Games Workers&#39; Union had recruited just over 10 percent of the company’s UK workforce to join. That’s one of the benchmarks needed to apply for statutory recognition in the country. If that were granted, the government would be able to force Rockstar to recognize the union. The Rockstar Games Workers&#39; Union was said to be just weeks away from formally announcing its existence before Rockstar allegedly fired a majority of the organizing committee.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9nOwjeznjI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/union-files-legal-claims-against-rockstar-games-following-alleged-union-busting-165033747.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Airbnb is testing a service in which guests can order groceries through Instacart, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-12/airbnb-will-test-adding-instacart-grocery-delivery-to-its-app-as-a-guest-service"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. This may not sound like a big deal at first, because guests can already use any grocery app during their stay to stock the house up with snacks. However, this service can be accessed by customers before their stay.</p>
<p>This means that folks can prepare for, say, a barbecue or similar event ahead of time. I can see this being pretty dang useful around certain holidays. This duty falls to the hosts, who will have to actually put the groceries away.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Airbnb will give hosts $25 for every completed order, so long as they tuck the food away before the guests arrive. Guests can, of course, order groceries through Instacart during their stay, though they&#39;ll have to put them away on their own. Customers will be allowed to place an Instacart order up to three weeks before their stay.</p>
<p>This pilot program begins on January 5 and Airbnb will be testing it for three months to see how guests and hosts react. It&#39;ll be open to &quot;select hosts&quot; throughout the US in areas like Phoenix, Orlando and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This is just the latest unique integration for Airbnb. The platform teamed up with ChargePoint last year to offer hosts <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-hosts-can-get-discounts-on-ev-chargers-122954626.html"><ins>discounts on EV chargers</ins></a>. This is an effort to entice hosts to install chargers on the premises.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/airbnb-tests-letting-users-order-groceries-through-instacart-161340408.html?src=rss]]></description>

What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.<br><br>Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday tech deals</a> you can get right now, and we&#39;ll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-black-friday-faqs">Black Friday FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-is-black-friday-2025">When is Black Friday 2025?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-stores-have-black-friday-deals">Which stores have Black Friday deals?</h3> 
<p>Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-start">When do Black Friday sales start?</h3> 
<p>Gone are the times when Black Friday sales were one-day-only affairs. Now, Black Friday deals are often available starting on Thanksgiving, or even earlier. Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-when-do-black-friday-sales-end">When do Black Friday sales end?</h3> 
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It&#39;s not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-which-retailers-have-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals?</h3> 
<p>The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It&#39;s also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you&#39;re looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you&#39;ll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-apple-have-black-friday-sales">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple&#39;s website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-does-amazon-have-black-friday-sales">Does Amazon have Black Friday sales?</h3> 
<p>Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer&#39;s site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-tech-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-anker-and-others-100052831.html?src=rss]]></description>

<h2 id="107b6e24-8e78-4b56-abb9-db2a26a8cb09">Hardware</h2>
<p>Framework’s late-2025 upgrade for the laptop is arguably more important than every product it’s released since its very first. It’s the first chance for users (of any laptop, really) to swap out or add a discrete GPU to an existing machine. If you bought the first-generation model, you could have relied on the integrated graphics, or equipped it with a discrete Radeon RX 7700S. Now, you get the option to buy NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 5070 with 8GB DDR7 RAM which you can add to the chassis yourself. The company has also repackaged the existing Radeon RX 7700S with the <em>promise</em> of less fan noise and better thermal performance than the previous model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new GPU pulls some of the focus away from the new mainboards, which are equipped with a choice of AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 350 or Ryzen AI 9 HZ 370, both of which promise to deliver 45W TDP. As before, you can equip the board with up to 86GB RAM, one or two SSDs, and your pick of ports via the six expansion card slots housed in the chassis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re buying the laptop new, you’ll get a raft of smaller upgrades, starting with a new 165Hz, 2,560 x 1,600 panel which supports NVIDIA G-Sync. Plus, a new top cover, improved keyboard, number pad, webcam, Wi-Fi 7 support and an upgraded 240W power adapter. Sadly, I can’t talk about these as I was testing the upgrade from the 2024 model which just included the new mainboard and GPU module.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Framework did listen to gripes about that rear-slung USB-C port which previously didn’t support charging. It was an omission that severely vexed my colleague Devindra Hardawar <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-16-review-modular-wonder-mediocre-gaming-laptop-150026910.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">in his review of the original machine</a>. But now, if you splurge for the RTX 5070, you can now use the rear port in the way that most people would intend. (If you’re unfamiliar, the Laptop 16’s discrete GPUs are packaged in self-contained&nbsp; “Expansion Modules” that go into the back of the chassis. The Radeon version could only be used for accessories and/or connecting additional displays.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rounding out the changes is Framework’s continual promise that it’s improved the cooling situation. The thermal paste has been switched out for Honeywell PTM, there’s a new, redesigned fan geometry and tweaked pipes for better airflow. And, look, I don’t want to ding Framework for failing to deliver on one promise when it’s kept so many others. But if you’ve followed the company for any length of time, you already know what I’m gonna say in the In-use section.</p>

<p>As is custom whenever discussing an AMD-toting Framework machine, you’ll need to memorize the diagram of which expansion card slots will work with which devices. We’re not going to ding Framework for an issue present in all AMD hardware, and the only reason it’s noticeable here is that you have the choice of which ports to use for what. You don’t have the sort of universal port flexibility that you might otherwise be expecting.</p>
<h2 id="d312ff79-f58f-456f-a5cd-2c827a2a0d0f">Installation</h2>
<p>Laptop 16 is bigger and more complex than its smaller siblings, but that doesn’t mean it’s any harder to maintain. The company’s iFixit-style guides hold your hand so well that popping the mid plate off should feel as natural as breathing. And you get a real sense of how well the components are laid out when you’re asked to take them all apart and put them back together. The company says replacing the mainboard and graphics module should take you an hour, which is far too generous. It took me about 22 minutes to get everything swapped in and set up, to the point where I think installing the new drivers was more laborious than this.</p>
<p>I can’t stress enough how much of a feat it is to have a modular, upgradeable gaming laptop that offers you the chance to leap a generation. Being able to pull out a two-year-old Radeon to swap in a fresh RTX is the stuff of dreams (for some people, at least). Imagine how long it’ll be possible to keep this machine going if this type of bi-annual upgrade cycle continues. This isn’t a particularly difficult process, making it easy enough for those folks who would otherwise blanch at the idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, strapping such a powerful chip and graphics [INAUDIBLE DUE TO FAN NOISE] lead to issues. As discrete components, both the mainboard and expansion module need their own self-contained cooling. That’s never going to be as efficient as a holistically designed laptop. When you’re not taxing the machine, it’s not an issue at all, it’s only when you use it for its intended purpose that it becomes a serious problem. If you want to play games with this thing, get headphones or put the subtitles on, and don’t even think about using this in public. Did… did you hear that? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I SAID… AS DISCRETE COMPONENTS…</p>
<p>And that’s before we get to the heat that this thing kicks out. I’ve got my unit on a stand with about four inches of clearance from the desk. I put my hand underneath the chassis to feel how warm it was getting and it was enough to make me never want to put this on my lap, <em>ever</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a shame the noise and heat is such a bear as it’s a machine with sufficient grunt to impress many a jaded enthusiast. I set <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to the highest settings I could (Ray Tracing: Overdrive) on 1080p, and it was able to comfortably produce 140 fps. Setting it to the defaults (Ray Tracing: Low, but the resolution set to the display’s maximum) it was able to crank out 182 fps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll find similarly-impressive performance if you use the Laptop 16 more for productivity than gaming. It compressed a 38GB 4K video file down to an 8GB HD mp4 in 28 minutes and 29 seconds. Using LM Studio, I was able to run Google’s Gemma 3 27B model with what I’d call fairly decent performance. Certainly, the chatbot wasn’t responding as quickly as Gemini would online, but it was hardly stuttering. I’d say that the performance here is more or less what you’d expect from the specs, with the one downside being that godawful fan noise.</p>
<h2 id="68c846e3-23f4-4cba-a337-d236889825f0">Pricing</h2>
<p>If you buy a new Laptop 16 pre-built from Framework, the Ryzen AI 7 configuration starts at $1,500, the AI 9 at $1,800. Add in the RTX 5070 and you can add another $699 to that price, which is the same cost as if you buy the GPU standalone as an upgrade. Or, if money’s tight, you could buy the new machine now and then add in the 5070 whenever you’d like — that’s the benefit of modularity.</p>
<p>It should be obvious you can get laptops with these sorts of components for less if you look elsewhere. In the run-up to the holiday season, I’ve seen machines — such as HP’s <a target="_blank" class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=4706ab41-7ce0-4709-a47c-6a63d6c81dd4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP+Store&amp;linkText=Omen+Max&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ocC5jb20vdXMtZW4vc2hvcC9jdXN0b20vb21lbi1tYXgtZ2FtaW5nLWxhcHRvcC0xNnotYWswMDAtMTYtaW5jaC1hbWQtcnl6ZW4tYWktMzJnYi1yYW0tMXRiLXNzZC1CODZXUUFWXzczOTM_Y2F0RW50cnlJZD0zMDc0NDU3MzQ1NjIxOTM3ODI2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NzA2YWI0MS03Y2UwLTQ3MDktYTQ3Yy02YTYzZDZjODFkZDQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhwLmNvbS91cy1lbi9zaG9wL2N1c3RvbS9vbWVuLW1heC1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wLTE2ei1hazAwMC0xNi1pbmNoLWFtZC1yeXplbi1haS0zMmdiLXJhbS0xdGItc3NkLUI4NldRQVZfNzM5Mz9jYXRFbnRyeUlkPTMwNzQ0NTczNDU2MjE5Mzc4MjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQT5IdnUPZ1YdsxfzcMIoblhSxu3jAR9VO_GiGEIzN_a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fcustom%2Fomen-max-gaming-laptop-16z-ak000-16-inch-amd-ryzen-ai-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-B86WQAV_7393%3FcatEntryId%3D3074457345621937826" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP Store;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" data-original-link="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/custom/omen-max-gaming-laptop-16z-ak000-16-inch-amd-ryzen-ai-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-B86WQAV_7393?catEntryId=3074457345621937826">Omen Max</a> — offer a Ryzen AI 7 and an RTX 5070 Ti for under $2,000. But here you’re not just buying a laptop, you’re buying into Framework’s broader ethos. You’ll get the fastest machine it can sell you right now, plus the ability to cheaply swap out to the next big thing in a couple years’ time without the cost of buying a new machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said back when reviewing the Ryzen AI 300 <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/framework-laptop-13-2025-with-amd-ryzen-ai-300-review-the-usual-iterative-upgrade-172031005.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1">upgrades for the Laptop 13 earlier this year</a>, Framework is well placed to take advantage of the world’s political situation. If the price of a whole new laptop skyrockets, then you can at least make a saving by just replacing what you need.</p>
<h2 id="8334974c-ccfc-42d5-8580-a121a50535fe">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I wonder if “Should you get one?” is the best question to ask and answer given the singular furrow Framework is ploughing. If you want a powerful laptop where every part can be replaced or upgraded, you don’t really have a serious alternative. Laptop 16’s natural target market is professionals and enthusiasts who value modularity and longevity over everything else. These new components give you enough power to play games, run AI models locally and whatever other demanding tasks you’ll throw at it.</p>
<p>As for everyone else, it’s a question of how willing you are to accept the heat, the noise and the slightly agricultural aesthetics. After all, this machine isn’t the sort of gadget you’ll be looking to move on in a few years’ time, it’ll be one you’re committing to for a long while.&nbsp;</p>

As a reminder of how we got here, the Walt Disney Co. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html">pulled its channels from YouTube TV</a> on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement, and YouTube TV subscribers have gone without NFL, NBA and NCAA games on ABC and ESPN's suite of channels for two straight weekends. With no agreement in sight, YouTube TV subscribers will be left in the dark for tonight's NBA games, too.</p> 
<p>Tonight's basketball games between the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/orlando-magic-new-york-knicks-2025111218/">Orlando Magic vs. New York Knicks</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers-oklahoma-city-thunder-2025111225/">Los Angeles Lakers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder</a> both air on ESPN, so if you want to catch either game (or watch <em>The Golden Bachelor</em> season finale on ABC!), you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>One of the cheapest ways to watch ESPN is with a Sling Day Pass — for just $5/day, you can tune into any and all ESPN programming with no other commitments. If you want a full switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all the Disney-owned channels. (Remember, unlike a lot of cable plans, you can easily <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-or-pause-your-youtube-tv-subscription-192023656.html">pause or cancel YouTube TV</a> or any of these alternatives, so long as you have month-to-month subscriptions.) Below, we've outlined some of your best options to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, all pulled from our list of <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html">best live TV streaming services to cut cable</a>, as well as a comprehensive list of which channels have been affected, and the biggest sporting events of the week that <em>won't</em> be available to YouTube TV subscribers.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-get-your-local-programming-for-free">What about Sling "day passes"?</h2> 
<p>You may have heard that <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-tv-launches-a-5-day-pass-for-commitment-free-cable-150021645.html">Sling offers day, weekend and week passes</a> to its streaming programming for as little as $5 per day. That is an option if you're looking for just some of the ESPN channels (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sling TV;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d1c9a21f-4263-4b41-b619-0f75ee410a45&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;linkText=Sling+Orange&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGluZy5jb20vc2VydmljZS9zbGluZy1vcmFuZ2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxYzlhMjFmLTQyNjMtNGI0MS1iNjE5LTBmNzVlZTQxMGE0NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL3NlcnZpY2Uvc2xpbmctb3JhbmdlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbQNsyHVoqqGrCK2uUWWsoTmJixhbsecRFvs0n76GM7o&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fservice%2Fsling-orange" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.sling.com/service/sling-orange">Sling Orange</a> tier), but ABC isn't included. (If you're just looking to catch one of this week's big games, like <em>Monday Night Football</em> on ESPN, it's a great short-term solution.) If you want a longer-term solution, you can get both ESPN and ABC with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-is-almost-ready-and-its-a-big-deal-150033468.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Analogue 3D</a> is finally set to ship to buyers. After several delays, Analogue is set to start sending out its 4K remake of the Nintendo 64 on November 18, as spotted by — appropriately enough — <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5gsmy54br2h" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">Wario64</a>. If you haven’t already locked in a pre-order, however, you face a longer wait, as both the black and white variants of the $250 system are out of stock.</p><p>Unless there’s a last-minute hitch, the company behind the Analogue Pocket will stick to the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">promise it made in August</a> to ship the 3D in the last quarter of 2025. Analogue previously delayed the 3D in March and then again in July. </p><p>As with other Analogue systems, the console uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate Nintendo’s original hardware. FPGA-based systems are more accurate than software emulation options and tend to have lower input lag.</p><p>Analogue claims the 3D will support every N64 cartridge — both PAL and NTSC variants — without any inaccuracies or slowdowns. I’m interested to see how well that promise will hold up in a four-player round of <em>Perfect Dark</em>. </p><p>The 3D delivers 4K output and supports variable refresh rate. You’ll be able to use &quot;original display mode&quot; filters to replicate the look of playing on a CRT or PVM. There’s still always the option of picking up an N64, but Analogue’s approach to scaling might make the 3D the best way to play N64 games (using original cartridges) on modern TVs.</p><p>The 3D has four ports into which you can plug original N64 controllers. It also has a USB-C power port, two USB ports for accessories (such as third-party controllers) and an HDMI port. In addition, the console has a Wi-Fi chip that can be used for operating system updates. The Analogue 3D only officially runs games from N64 cartridges. I’m 100 percent sure that no one will jailbreak the system to boot ROMs from the SD card slot. Nope, no way. </p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogues-4k-remake-of-the-n64-will-at-long-last-ship-on-november-18-151854397.html?src=rss]]></description>

This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you&#39;re going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people think the original <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-30-google-glass-review.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF28k3xfmfRkWfn8bQMnUSxfDPZY9wL8OsZ7JT-dWUzdrdgmAvzix3Bz3u6VkPZFCE0LP3gq1x8bv-Ois4rQxn9jJdajrBk-pRU-tJh5ICn4rDEGc7J7lXg9sC3_g3vcz420K9rZFclmfNd5kKGq6qWMWRPoJzUOUar40FYE7jxk" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Google Glass</a> failed because of subpar tech. But the larger issue was that they were so ugly that people simply didn&#39;t want to wear them. And when it&#39;s a device that sits on your face, that&#39;s kind of important. Thankfully, that&#39;s a lesson Even Realities seemingly took to heart when it made the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/even-realities-g1-review-limited-but-effective-smart-glasses-140059586.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">G1</a>, which combined the stylishness of proper eyewear with built-in waveguide displays. Now the company is back with its second-gen smart glasses&nbsp; — the G2 — which offer even better optics, an updated UI and a companion ring (the R1) to their expanded list of features.&nbsp;</p><p>While the design of the Even G2 hasn&#39;t changed a ton from its predecessor, that&#39;s not a bad thing as there wasn&#39;t much to fix. Compared to every other pair of smart glasses on sale today, these look the most like normal eyewear. Meanwhile, thanks to a titanium and magnesium alloy design and the company&#39;s very intentional decision not to include onboard cameras or speakers, the new model only weighs 36 grams, so they&#39;re also super comfortable. You even get two styles to choose from (panto or rectangular) along with a few different finishes (gray, brown and green), so chances are there&#39;s a combination that will work with your wardrobe. The Even G2 also features an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, so you don&#39;t need to worry about wearing them in adverse conditions.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Even-G2-edited.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Even-G2-edited.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="The G2&#39;s battery life can last up to two days, while its case has juice for up to seven additional charges. " data-uuid="3a3b7950-3c1c-46ff-9b4a-2078057956e3"><figcaption>The G2&#39;s battery life can last up to two days, while its case has juice for up to seven additional charges. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The G2’s optics are based on the company&#39;s new Even HAO 2.0 (Holistic Adaptive Optics) that use custom-designed dual waveguides to produce a green heads-up display. It’s not only brighter and sharper than before but also features a wider field of view. Now admittedly, that&#39;s not quite as impressive as the single RGB display in something like the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Ray-Ban Meta Display</a>. But considering that the Even G2 is way less chunky and sports significantly longer battery life (up to two days plus seven full recharges from its included case), that feels like a worthy trade-off to deliver increased usability.</p><p>However, the biggest upgrade for the G2 is an expanded roster of smart features. In addition to showing notifications, turn-by-turn directions and the teleprompter functionality available on the previous model, Even has developed a much more robust UI that lets you read the news, track stock prices and create lists using your voice. There is now an onboard AI assistant and LLM that can translate speech on the fly or pick out key words during a conversation to give more background and context about unfamiliar terms. This means the glasses can handle a lot of tasks you&#39;d normally need your phone for, which is great if you&#39;re walking around, or similarly indisposed, and would rather keep your hands free.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/even-r1.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/even-r1.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="In addition to basic health and fitness tracking, the R1 ring also has a tiny built-in touchpad (denoted by the four dots) to make it easier to navigate the G2&#39;s new UI and menus. " data-uuid="52f0f81b-b348-46cd-bbdd-f2ec7acf7f4a"><figcaption>In addition to basic health and fitness tracking, the R1 ring also has a tiny built-in touchpad (denoted by the four dots) to make it easier to navigate the G2&#39;s new UI and menus. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>While you can access most of these features using voice controls, the icing on the cake is the R1 companion ring that makes better use of the new UI. Not only does it track some basic health and fitness data (steps, heart rate, sleep, SpO2 and more), it also serves as a tiny touchpad so you can check notifications, revisit your notes and more without anyone nearby knowing what you&#39;re up to. All told, the G2 glasses and the R1 ring create a very stylish and discreet package that allows you to stay connected and keep your phone in your pocket.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, you might want to wait before throwing money down on these. I&#39;ve been testing the G2 and R1 over the past few days, and even though I really like the hardware, the company&#39;s software just isn&#39;t ready yet. It&#39;s important to note that I&#39;ve been using a beta version of the Even Realties app, so encountering some bugs was not entirely unexpected. But even so, the touch controls on the ring feel imprecise and occasionally erratic. Many of the fitness metrics aren&#39;t being properly recorded and both devices have had a difficult time staying paired to the app. Even little things, like the auto brightness settings (which don&#39;t work at the moment) or ability to add more sources to the glasses&#39; news feed, feel janky. The only outlet I&#39;ve been able to successfully use is ABC.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/even-g2-app.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/even-g2-app.jpg" style="height:2000px;width:3333px;" alt="While the tech and features of the G2 are very interesting, I&#39;ve run into a number of software issues while using a beta version of the app. " data-uuid="84d7c8ee-bab4-4c82-abe1-1851d733ec1d"><figcaption>While the tech and features of the G2 are very interesting, I&#39;ve run into a number of software issues while using a beta version of the app. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Granted, some of the G2 and R1&#39;s issues that I&#39;ve run into, like wonky touch input and the unfinished health tracking, are known problems that are currently being worked on by Even Realities. Still, this feels like a situation where the launch of these devices should have been delayed until the company could smooth out these hiccups.</p><p>But if you are undeterred, the Even G2 Display Smart Glasses and Even R1 Smart Ring go on sale today for $599 and $249, respectively. For everyone else, I&#39;m hoping to check back in on these devices after the company pushes out some software updates. I’m eager to see if they can eventually live up to their potential as an interesting alternative to bigger, chunkier and more intrusive smartglass alternatives like the Ray-Ban Meta Displays.</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/even-realities-g2-first-look-this-years-best-looking-new-smart-glasses-still-need-work-151500132.html?src=rss]]></description>

For example, Even Realities says the new glasses can display pop-ups like AI prompts and notifications at a different depth from the glasses&#39; normal interface, so you don&#39;t lose the context of whatever you&#39;re reading. The G2 also supports a wider range of prescription lenses (from -12 to +12 diopters), making them more accessible to people who already wear glasses.</p><p>In comparison to the G1, Even Realities says the G2 has 54 percent slimmer temples and, in a first for the company, is IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. The G2 also gets two days of battery life in comparison to the G1&#39;s one and a half days, and its charging case can provide up to seven full charges.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Even-R1-Smart-Ring.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Even-R1-Smart-Ring.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A ceramic and titanium R1 smart ring with a flat side." data-uuid="5abe7cf2-584d-4a74-994b-6f1f982b5b92"><figcaption>A ceramic and titanium R1 smart ring with a flat side.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Even Realities</div></figure><p>While <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/even-realities-g2-first-look-this-years-best-looking-new-smart-glasses-still-need-work-151500132.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">the G2 glasses</a> can still be controlled by tapping a built-in touchpad or using voice commands, the R1 Smart Ring will let you interact with the smart glasses without moving your arm.

Besides a touch sensor for navigation, the R1 also includes an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometer for tracking your heart rate and steps, which can be viewed on the G2.

The G2 supports the same translation, notifications and teleprompter features as the company&#39;s last model, but this time includes a feature called &quot;Conversate&quot; that attempts to offer AI-generated information during conversations. Even Realities says Conversate can provide explanations, context and follow-up questions during a conversation, and then generate a summary and key points once you&#39;re finished talking. The whole thing sounds a bit distracting, but might be something you have to demo to understand.</p><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Even-Realities-G2-charging-case.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Even-Realities-G2-charging-case.jpg" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="A pair of Even G2 Display Smart Glasses in a charging case." data-uuid="c363468d-bf6b-4284-b3d7-b7ad33e053a5"><figcaption>A pair of Even G2 Display Smart Glasses in a charging case.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Even Realities</div></figure><p>That extra layer of complication seems inherent to the pitch for both the G2 glasses and the R1 ring.

Through December 4, you’ll be able to get 50 percent off the regular annual subscription price, bringing a full year of guided meditations, sleep sounds and mindfulness tools down to $35 per year. If you’ve been looking to build a better daily routine, this discount makes it easier to start.</p> 
<p>Headspace has become one of the most recognizable names in digital mindfulness. The app blends practical meditation guidance with structured courses and calming soundscapes designed to make everyday stress easier to manage. Its programs cover everything from beginner-friendly introductions to mindfulness to focused content on topics like anxiety, productivity and sleep.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Subscribers get access to hundreds of guided sessions led by the Headspace team, including short daily practices that can be completed in a few spare minutes, plus longer courses that help build consistency. The app’s Sleepcasts and soundscapes are unique, designed to create a steady nighttime routine that promotes better rest. For mornings, there are breathing exercises and motivational mini-sessions that can help set focus for the day ahead.</p> 
<p>Headspace also includes personalized progress tracking, mood check-ins and optional reminders that make it easier to stay consistent with your new mindfulness habits. For anyone new to meditation, the app’s clear structure is a major strength. You don’t have to know where to start, since it suggests sessions based on your goals or current mood.</p> 
<p>This annual deal is ideal for users who want to stick with mindfulness practice over time, or anyone interested in incorporating a new habit into their lives. Paying for the year upfront typically saves money compared with the monthly plan, and the discount brings that cost down even further. Whether you’re learning the basics of meditation or refining an existing routine, the full library provides enough variety to keep things engaging throughout the year.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Alien franchise has been decidedly hit and miss since the near-universally beloved first two movies, but it’s in a very good place at the moment. 2024’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alien-romulus-is-a-magnificent-return-to-form-193025453.html"><em>Alien: Romulus </em></a>was a magnificent return to form, and this year that good run of form continued in the series’ first TV show, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alien-earth-succeeds-where-ridley-scotts-alien-sequels-failed-173234905.html"><em>Alien: Earth</em></a>, which has been renewed for a second season.</p>
<p>The first season wrapped up in September and ended on a pretty dramatic cliffhanger, so while it seemed pretty obvious that more episodes would be coming, it’s good to have it confirmed. Noah Hawley is once again heading up the project, and according to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/alien-earth-renewed-season-2-noah-hawley-fx-deal-1236424398/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>the <em>Fargo </em>creator has signed a multi-year deal with Disney that will see him work on the ever-expanding entertainment empire&#39;s other channels and services, including ABC and Hulu Originals, as well as continuing to produce shows for FX.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Variety </em><a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/alien-earth-renewed-season-2-noah-hawley-overall-deal-fx-1236575612/">reports</a> that season two of <em>Alien: Earth </em>will start production in London in 2026, a pretty significant change from the debut season, which was shot in Thailand. Presumably that means we’ll be heading to some new locations in the show too, but we’ll have to wait for a trailer to find that out.</p>
<p>Set two years before the original <em>Alien</em>, <em>Alien: Earth </em>sees a retro-futuristic shipping vessel carrying some ominously familiar-looking extra-terrestrial cargo crash-land on Earth, where we meet a terminally ill girl who becomes the first human-synthetic hybrid. The season one cast includes Sydney Chandler, Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Essie Davis, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, David Rysdahl, Adrian Edmondson, Adarsh Gourav, Jonathan Ajayi, Erana James, Lily Newmark, Diem Camille, and Moe Bar-El.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/alien-earth-has-been-renewed-for-a-second-season-144124743.html?src=rss]]></description>

The sequel to <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-fun-safe-romp-135146207.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, the highest-grossing movie based on video games, will hit theaters in the US on April 3.   </p><p>The trailer opens with Bowser engaging in a little art therapy, which, honestly, could be really great for him. Mario can’t help put put down Bowser’s artwork, though. What a jerk. From there, the action riffs on <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> as Peach and Toad use launch stars to travel to a different planet. I don’t want to give away everything that happens, so just watch the trailer. The visuals, as you’d expect from Illumination, look terrific.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The trailer also confirms the addition of two fan-favorite characters this time around: Rosalina (who takes out a giant robot with her abilities) and Bowser Jr, who is taking his father’s place as the sequel’s villain. Rosalina is played by Brie Larson, while Benny Safdie voice Bowser Jr.</p><p>An extra clip after the trailer shows Rosalina reading a story about Princess Peach to a group of Lumas. Another features Bowser Jr. promising that “the Bowser name shall be feared once more.” Ominous!</p><p>However, the Direct didn’t include any indication of Yoshi appearing in the film. An Easter egg at the end of the first movie showed Yoshi’s egg cracking. Plus, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/latest-super-mario-galaxy-leak-comes-from-pillsbury-cookies-offers-our-best-look-yet-at-yoshi-and-all-but-confirms-two-more-fan-favorite-characters" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">a Pillsbury cookie box</a> — of all things — all but confirmed Yoshi would be in the movie, while hinting at the inclusion of Princess Rosalina and Bowser Jr. We’ll perhaps have to wait until the next trailer to get a glimpse of Mario’s dino pal, who’ll probably be green even though everyone knows in their heart blue Yoshi is the best Yoshi.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-confirms-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-are-in-the-sequel-142815627.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At this point, the streaming music landscape feels pretty well settled. Giants like Spotify, Amazon, Apple and YouTube duke it out at the top, while plenty of other players like Qobuz, Tidal, Deezer try their best to stand out from the pack. Somewhat surprisingly, though, a new player emerged in September. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://codamusic.me/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">Coda Music</a> used the recent <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/daniel-ek-is-stepping-down-as-spotify-ceo-161519791.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">backlash around Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek</a> as a way to differentiate itself from the number one streamer, calling out Ek’s controversial funding of defense technology firm Helsing earlier in the year. (Spotify’s refusal to stop airing ICE recruitment ads certainly hasn’t helped the platform, either.)</p><p>Today, the fledgling service is announcing a new feature that feels designed to answer another of the recent Spotify controversies: AI slop music <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">flooding the platform</a>. In response, Coda Music is launching AI identification tools with the purpose of finding and labeling songs that weren’t composed by actual humans.</p><p>There are a few prongs to Coda’s approach. For starters, any artist added to Coda will be reviewed for AI origins, and their profile will be labeled “AI Artist” so that listeners know what they’re getting into. Coda is also letting users flag profiles of artists if they suspect the music is AI-generated; the company will then review them and label them if necessary. </p><p>Finally, there’s a toggle in settings that just lets you turn off AI artists entirely. Obviously, how useful this setting is will depend on how good Coda gets at labeling AI-created music as such, but I can definitely see the appeal in just flipping that to “off” and avoiding as much slop as possible. </p><p>Besides its stance on AI and the assurance that the company does not “invest in war,” there are a few other differentiators about Coda Music. The company says that it currently paying the “highest per-stream rate” in the industry —&nbsp;while at the same time, it acknowledges that no one is paying enough to artists. “The real problem isn’t how much is paid per stream, it’s that streaming alone doesn’t pay enough,” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://codamusic.me/rewritingTheRulesOfStreaming.php" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">the company’s website says</a>. “And minor improvements to a fundamentally flawed per stream model will not help.”</p><p>To that end, the company also lets users pick an “independent or qualifying artist” who gets $1 of their monthly subscription fee. Sure, it’s only a dollar, but it’s the kind of thing that sweetens the pot at least a little bit for musicians. </p><p>And Coda has good reason to want to make itself visible to users and artists alike. The last major differentiator for Coda is the company’s ambitions to turn its app into a social, music-sharing feed where you get recommendations from humans rather than algorithms. To that end, users can share anything from the app in their feed, and it also allows you to share external links and photos as well (go ahead and post your blurry images from that NIN concert!). </p><p>The app’s home page prominently features fan-made playlists and recommended users to follow in addition to the usual suggestions based on what you’re listening to already. And there’s a social tab where you can see posts from people you follow; share songs, artists or albums; and see posts from artists you follow. That last part is key, as Coda wants artists interacting and sharing as well as just end users.</p><p>It reminds me a little bit of the Fan Groups feature that <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-musics-fan-groups-are-a-refreshingly-old-school-way-to-share-and-find-tunes-150000084.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">Amazon Music just announced</a> — and as with that feature, the problem facing Coda is getting people to start contributing to a new network rather than just posting things on whatever app they’re already using. Fortunately, music nerds love a community, so it’ll be interesting to see if this takes off at all.  </p><p>As for the new features for reporting and filtering out AI music, Coda says they’re available as of today in its iOS and Android apps. The company doesn’t have a web interface yet, but says it is coming soon. If ducking AI-generated tunes is something that catches your attention, Coda currently costs $11 a month, or $17 per month for a family plan with up to four listeners. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/new-streaming-app-coda-music-is-rolling-out-tools-for-labeling-and-blocking-ai-generated-tunes-140000530.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Apple AirPods 4 are the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html">best budget AirPods</a> you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/grab-a-pair-of-airpods-4-earbuds-for-only-85-before-black-friday-162917254.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/legal-action-and-legislation-fight-scammers/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">filed a lawsuit</a> against a group of Chinese hackers <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/f90f6657-8fd7-4ee4-9ef4-3694b501e3d7" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">running a platform</a> called “Lighthouse” that sells <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-phishing-how-to-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams-185143394.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">phishing</a> services for a monthly fee. The group offers clients its services to launch massive phishing and smishing (SMS phishing) campaigns. Google says the bad actors typically send out emails or text messages that link to fake websites pretending to be legitimate pages of established brands like USPS and E-Z Pass, in order to trick people into keying in their log-ins and other sensitive details. The company found at least 107 sign-in screen templates with Google branding, designed to steal people’s log-in information. </p><p>In its announcement, Google said that one million people from 121 countries have fallen victim to the online scams that used Lighthouse and that the bad actors have already stolen $1 billion. In the US alone, they’ve gotten their hands on between 12.7 million and 115 million credit card numbers. The most popular scheme involves pretending to be the USPS and telling victims that they’d have to pay for the redelivery of a package stuck at the post office. </p><p>As The <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/f90f6657-8fd7-4ee4-9ef4-3694b501e3d7" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports, Google cited data from cybersecurity company Silent Push in its lawsuit as an example, stating that Chinese criminal group “Smishing Triad” used Lighthouse earlier this year to create 200,000 fake websites. Those websites apparently received 50,000 visits a day and compromised millions of US credit cards within a 20-day period. The company is bringing claims under the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. If the company wins, it would allow Google to work with carriers and website hosts to take down the operation’s domain and servers. </p><p>In addition to filing the lawsuit, Google is also backing bipartisan bills in Congress that take aim at foreign cybercriminals. One bill would enable state and local law enforcement to use federal grant funding to investigate financial fraud targeting retirees. Another aims to establish a task force to block foreign robocalls in the US. The last one targets scam compounds, or centers that serve as bases for scam operations, and intends to provide support to the survivors who were trafficked and forced to work for those centers. </p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-sues-group-running-massive-sms-scam-operation-133000168.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>In a new teaser trailer for <em>Toy Story 5</em>, Buzz, Woody and the rest of the gang face what may be their ultimate enemy in the war for a child&#39;s play time: <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/">electronics</a>.</p>
<p>With INXS&#39;s <em>Never Tear Us Apart</em> playing in the background, we see the delivery of a parcel to Bonnie Anderson, Andy&#39;s younger sister, who inherited his toys back in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-15-toy-story-3-and-the-mac.html"><em>Toy Story 3</em></a>. Our heroes including Rex, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Potato Head, Woody, Buzz and Jessie, look on in horror as she opens the package to reveal a frog-themed tablet named Lilypad. &quot;Let&#39;s Play!&quot; it proposes. Bonnie seems ready to do so, and possibly forget about her other pals in short order. &quot;Is the age of toys over?&quot; the tagline asks.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tablets have long succeeded classic toys, of course, but it&#39;s still a fun plot idea and likely very relatable to parents who&#39;ve grown up with these films. The sequel brings back the franchise&#39;s regular cast including Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack, while welcoming newcomers Conan O&#39;Brien, Ernie Hudson and Greta Lee as Lilypad&#39;s voice. It&#39;s set to hit theaters in June 2026.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/watch-pixars-new-teaser-for-toy-story-5-130011156.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Google TV Streamer is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device</a>. It has a faster processor than Google&#39;s previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>
 <core-commerce id="19861e84880547b7a1b7e067db74cdcb" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8WJYSF9?th=1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV.</p> 
<p>The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you&#39;ll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don&#39;t already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it.</p>

In previous games, the endurance events really took 24 hours to finish, though you could pause and, eventually, save mid-race, allowing you to pick up where you left off. You can also experience full-race seasons, from practicing for them to qualifying for the main events. </p><p>The DLC includes access to Gran Turismo Sophy 3.0, as well, which Sony says will provide “realistic AI behavior” and enable “intense, tail-to-nose battles that push your limits.” <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-gt-sophy-racing-ai-gran-turismo-7-ps5-130057992.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">Sophy 2.0</a> was launched as an update back in 2023, offering you “a stimulating opponent that can accelerate and elevate [your] techniques and creativity to the next level.” Finally, the DLC will give you 5 million in in-game Credits. The companies have yet to reveal how much the Power Pack DLC will cost, but it will be available for download from the PlayStation Store. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Play through full sessions from practice to qualifying to the race, and go tail-to-nose with GT Sophy 3.0!<br><br>The Power Pack DLC adds 50 new races like 24H endurance and comes with 5M in-game credits.

Previous Pokémon parks and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-studios-japan-partners-with-pokemon-on-new-in-park-entertainment-103504372.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">attractions</a> existed in the past, but they were only open for a limited time. PokéPark Kanto will be located inside the Yomiuriland  amusement park in Tokyo, Japan and will require an add-on pass to enter. Visitors will have to go through a “Pokémon Research Lab” building, which serves as the gateway to the park’s two sections: Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town</p><p>The Pokémon Forest is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a stretch of land with hills, paths with tall grass, rocky trails and tunnels where visitors will see Pokémon in their natural habitats. The Pokémon statues are posed to show that they’re engaging in various activities, such as battling or playing with friends. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sedge Town is the town center where visitors will find the Pokémon Center and Poké Mart, which sounds like a place where they can buy some refreshments. In addition to the main attractions, PokéPark Kanto will feature Pika Pika Paradise, a ride featuring over 30 electric-type Pokémon. There’s also Vee Vee Voyage, a carousel featuring carriages pulled by Ponyta and Rapidash, as well as balloons where visitors can ride with Eevee. </p><p>We’ve yet to see actual photos of the park, but the trailer below will give you a glimpse of what you can expect.</p><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/No34HQuKSEg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-first-permanent-pokemon-theme-park-opens-in-february-2026-012228856.html?src=rss]]></description>

This DLC is the first big content update for the spinoff, although Nightreign did receive previous updates to add improved tuning for the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-is-adding-two-player-co-op-next-week-182708700.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">two-player</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-patch-will-make-gameplay-easier-for-solo-players-183644323.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">solo-player</a> experiences, as well introducing an even-more-punishing Deep of Night mode.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer shows exactly the grim, macabre setting and inventive-looking boss designs that we&#39;ve come to expect from FromSoft. <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> will add two more character classes for players to choose from.

Along with a refreshed Japanese-only PS5 Digital Edition, the company unveiled an official PlayStation monitor that you can also hook your PC up to. It’s a 27-inch QHD display with a 240Hz refresh rate and support for HDR and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-variable-refresh-rate-vrr-release-date-193228613.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">variable refresh rate</a>.

It folds down from the rear of the display and you can place your DualSense controller on it, so you’re ready to play whenever the mood strikes. The monitor will be available in the US and Japan sometime next year.

(Presumably Lego Navi will not interrupt you with &quot;Hey! Listen!&quot; every five minutes, but maybe the company is striving for total accuracy.) A blurry Zelda minifig stands behind them, and the heroes stare upward at the looming shadow of what must be a Ganon character. Whether the villain is a minifig of his own or a larger-than-life constructed model remains to be seen. The set won&#39;t be released until 2026, but most likely either Lego or Nintendo will reveal more details ahead of the launch date.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Hyrule is getting the Lego treatment.

In response, the company is recording around a $204 million impairment on the developer&#39;s intangible assets.</p><p>The impairment isn&#39;t equivalent to money lost, but rather a representation of <em>Destiny 2</em> not meeting the sales and engagement models Sony made when it acquired Bungie. The &quot;intangible assets&quot; Bungie brought to the deal, like the Destiny IP and the developer&#39;s existing customer relationships, are worth less right now than expected. However, that doesn&#39;t extend to the &quot;goodwill&quot; created when both companies agreed to the acquisition, Sonys says, because it’s &quot;supported by the whole game segment.&quot;</p><p>When it completed its <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-closes-bungie-acquisition-playstation-studios-190623763.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">acquisition of Bungie</a> for $3.6 billion in 2022, Sony believed the developer could use its expertise in running online games to help expand PlayStation&#39;s live service offerings.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can be tough to know when a phone is on its deathbed or when an app is just being an overt battery hog. Google is going to help users get to the bottom of things, according to a recent <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/raising-bar-on-battery-performance.html">Android Developers Blog</a>.</p>
<p>The company just announced the launch of a new metric for app developers that keeps an eye on battery usage. If a developer consistently runs afoul of Google&#39;s battery usage guidelines, a warning will pop up in the Play Store to alert end users.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/1faa0690-bf2f-11f0-b7ff-58cb4f7e21f2" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/1faa0690-bf2f-11f0-b7ff-58cb4f7e21f2" style="height:848px;width:945px;" alt="A Play Store warning." data-uuid="8805c259-2bde-3b1e-920e-2698f3821ac5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google </div></figure>
<p>This metric will keep a particular eye on so-called wake locks, which is when smartphones are prevented from entering sleep mode by battery-hungry apps that want to run background processes when the screen is off. Google says wake locks are a &quot;heavy contributor to battery drain&quot; and has developed a threshold for what is deemed acceptable for apps running in the background.</p>
<p>This threshold &quot;considers a user session excessive if it holds more than two cumulative hours of non-exempt wake locks in a 24 hour period.&quot; There are exemptions if the background process offers &quot;clear user benefits&quot; with examples given of audio playback and user-initiated data transfers.</p>
<p>If a developer doesn&#39;t fix the underlying wake lock issue, they get slapped with a visible warning. The Play Store label says that &quot;this app may use more battery than expected due to high background activity.&quot; That will likely turn off potential downloaders. I certainly wouldn&#39;t pop one of those apps on my phone.</p>
<p>Google will go a step further in some cases, making the offending apps ineligible for certain discovery sections within the Play Store. These rules go into effect on March 1, so we only have a few more months to experience just how quickly an Android phone can go from a full battery to completely dead.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-is-clamping-down-on-android-apps-that-cause-excessive-battery-drain-194008031.html?src=rss]]></description>
